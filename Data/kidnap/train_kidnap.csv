5,"- One of three men charged in connection to a shooting inside a Sandy Springs strip club was accidentally released from the Fulton County Jail, and those who run the facility have implemented a new policy to ensure the mistake wont happen again. Tracy Flanagan, spokesperson for the Fulton County Sheriffs Office, said the mishap occurred earlier this week when a staffer misread a court document related to the case of Lamar Hillard. Hillard, of Eerie, Pennsylvania, was arrested by Sandy Springs police following the Feb. 6 shooting inside Dollhouse at 5275 Roswell Road. Two men were seriously wounded in the shooting, which police previously told Patch stemmed from a dispute over money. Flanagan said a staff member at the jail said she saw the official stamp indicating the charges against Hillard were nolle prossed, or not to be prosecuted, and that he should have been a released a few days earlier. She rushed to begin processing paperwork because the jail is prohibited from holding persons longer than required by law, Flanagan added. Unfortunately, she overlooked a handwritten notation indicating that Hillard was re-indicted on the same charges. The grand jury re-indicted Hillard on criminal attempt to commit murder, armed robbery, three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, aggravated assault (reasonable apprehension) and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Hillard was released during the early hours on July 4, and the jail became aware of the error later that morning, Flanagan said. The Fulton sheriffs office obtained a judges signature to issue a warrant for Hillards arrest and the search for him spanned across the country. The Fulton County Sheriffs Offices Fugitive Unit, with the help of the United States Marshals Service Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force and the FBI, began tracking the shooting suspect. Investigators believed he would be heading to his home state of Pennsylvania, but on July 5, an Ohio state trooper pulled over Hillard. The trooper learned Hillard had a warrant for his arrest concerning drug charges dating back to 2008, in addition to the new arrest warrant issued by the Fulton sheriffs office, Flanagan added. He was arrested and is currently being held in Ashtabula, Ohio. Flanagan states Hillard has to answer to the charges in that state before he can be transported back to Fulton County. Once the case in Ohio is closed, the sheriffs office will begin the extradition process. The Fulton County Sheriffs Office is grateful to the Ohio State Highway Patrol and all the law enforcement professionals who worked swiftly to track Hillard and recapture him safely, Flanagan told Patch. To help prevent an error like this from happening in the future, Flanagan said a supervisor from the records unit as well as a supervisor from the section tasked with releasing inmates will now have to sign off on any release of those charged with one of Georgias seven deadly sins: murder, rape, armed robbery, aggravated child molestation, aggravated sodomy, aggravated sexual battery and kidnapping with bodily injury.

The investigation also revealed that the suspects lived in the area and they were subsequently arrested. Theisen also received a Commendation in 2015 for his response to an incident where a mother shot and killed her son after he broke into her apartment. Theisen secured the weapon, rendered first aid, and ensured the safety of everyone else at the residence.

9,"Police in the South Bay announced the arrest Friday of a suspect who allegedly tried to kidnap a 13-year-old girl this week as she walked home from school in Otay Mesa. Jose Alfredo Plascencia, 50, was arrested around 8:30 a.m. Thursday morning after officers tracked him down in the 600 block of Dennery Road, San Diego police Capt. Alberto Leos said. It wasnt immediately clear how investigators identified Plascencia as a suspect in the alleged abduction attempt near Montgomery Middle School. According to police, a motorist pulled up alongside a 13-year-old girl Tuesday as she walked home from school on an Otay Mesa roadside, grabbed her by the arm and made a failed attempt to pull her into his van. The kidnapping attempt occurred about 5:15 p.m. in the 700 block of Picador Boulevard, police said. The victim was able to break away from the man and run to safety. The would-be abductor, who was driving a black Mercedes-Benz van, was described as a white man in his 50s or early 60s with a full beard and a raspy voice. He was wearing gray pants, a grayish-green polo shirt and glasses, police said. Southern division began an immediate investigation into the allegation, Leos said. Through their investigation the subject was identified as a Jose Plascencia. Officers arrested Plascencia Thursday morning on suspicion of felony attempted kidnapping and an unrelated misdemeanor warrant, Leos said. He was booked into the San Diego Central Jail a little after noon Thursday.

10,"A known triggerman for the Black P-Stones looked into the face of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee and shot him until Shorty couldnt take it no more, Cook County States Attorney Anita Alvarez said on Tuesday. First-degree murder charges were announced for Dwright Boone-Doty, 21, who has been identified as the executioner in the Auburn-Gresham fourth-grader slaying on Nov. 2, 2015. Doty is the second man to be charged in Tyshawns murder. Police said the child was targeted because of his father, Pierre Stokes, a high-ranking member of the P-Stones rival, the Gangster Disciples. Another man, Corey Morgan, 27, was charged in November in the weeks following the boys murder, while a third man, 22-year-old Kevin Edwards, remains at large. Police say all three belong to the BBG (Bang Bang Gang)/Terror Dome faction of the Black P Stones, bitter rivals of the Gangster Disciples. Doty is also alleged to have stated his original intent was to kidnap and torture the boy by cutting off his fingers and ears. On Nov. 2, 2015, Doty, along with the same two co-defendants were combing the neighborhood looking for Gangster Disciple rivals when they arrived at Dawes Park at 80th Street and Damen Avenue, Alvarez said. Eventually they saw 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee, who was in the playlot at the park, Alvarez said. Tyshawn had gone to the swing set, set his basketball down and was playing on the swings. By then, Morgan and Edwards left the park and drove away in a small SUV. Doty stayed behind in the playground, striking up a conversation with Tyshawn, according to the complaint. He picked up the boys basketball and dribbled it a few times before giving it back to the boy. [Doty] asked Tyshawn if he wanted to go to the store, Alvarez said. When Tyshawn said he didnt have any money Doty told him he would buy him whatever he wanted. Witnesses reported to police seeing Doty and Tyshawn walking off together out of the park and into a nearby alley. Once they reached the middle of the alley, Doty allegedly took out a gun and shot the fourth-grader multiple times at close range. [Doty] was facing the child when he shot him, Alvarez said. He later made statements, Seeing that bitch going in his head, and Shorty was like he couldnt take it no more. Shorty couldnt take it no more. An autopsy report states that Tyshawn received a graze wound to the upper back, one superficial wound to his forearm and the fatal gunshot wound to the head. There were two more perforating gunshot wounds, one of which partially amputated the boys thumb as he held up his hands to ward off the bullet. Doty also later stated that after he murdered the boy he wanted to go back to the park and shoot it up, Alvarez said. After the murder, the three went to a Walmart where they purchased bleach and wiped down the inside and outside of the SUV before abandoning it, the complaint said. Alvarez said Doty was also working on a rap song about killing Tyshawn. Doty is also charged with first-degree murder, attempted first degree murder, and aggravated battery with a firearm in connection to the shooting death of Brianna Jenkins and the wounding of her friend, DeShari Bowens in October 2015. Those shootings are part of the same gang war. Reading from the court complaint against Doty, Alvarez said the bitter gang feud between the Black P-Stones and Gangster Disciples came boiling to a head when Corey Morgans brother, Tracey Morgan, was shot to death while sitting in a car with their mother on Oct. 13, 2015. Morgans mother, who was wounded, survived the attack. After his brothers death, Morgan vowed to kill grandmas, mamas, kids and all. Morgan, Doty and Edwards began going out daily armed with guns looking to retaliate, Alvarez said. Mere days after Tracey Morgans death, Brianna Jenkins and DeShari Bowers were seated in a car near 78th Street and Honore on Oct. 18, 2015, when Doty is alleged to have walked up to the vehicle and fired multiple shots into into it. The bullets struck and killed Jenkins and wounded Bowens. According to the charges, Doty later said he didnt know who was in the car. When he and Edwards saw Bowens dreadlocks, they believed he was a rival gang member. After killing Brianna and shooting DeShari, he reloaded the gun and and carried it around, Alvarez said. Following the shootings of Jenkins and Bowens, Doty began surveillance of Tyshawn Lees grandmother so he could kill her in order to draw out rival gang members, the Cook County states attorney continued. Doty is currently being held on $1 million bail on unrelated gun charges. Chicago police picked up Doty and Morgan in the weeks following Tyshawns murder last November in Evergreen Park after they left the Hilton Oak Lawn. Police are reported to have found two .40-caliber handguns in the vehicle allegedly belonging to the men, who, as convicted felons, are prohibited from owning guns. One of the guns was connected to the murder of Brianna Jenkins, Alvarez said. Bail was set at $1 million for both men, but Morgan was able to post the required $100,000 bond with money used from a court settlement his girlfriend won in a lawsuit against a hospital. Interim Chicago Police Superintendent John Escalante told reporters that the statements allegedly made by Doty about Tyshawns murder would eventually come out in a trial. Sources are telling the Chicago Tribune that a jail inmate secretly recorded Doty implicating himself in both killings. The newspaper said Chicago police detectives obtained a court order for the informant to wear a wire and record Boone-Doty. Escalante also encouraged Edwards to turn himself in for his own good.

11,"This is the third article in a three-part series on the over 40 year career of Dover Police Detective Sergeant Jeffrey Farrell, told mostly in his own words. Seeing is Believing For every person that says nothing ever happens in Dover, Farrell has a story to prove them wrong. One of the things that has always irked me about this job, when people find out what I do, that their response is almost universal, Oh Dover? Wow, that must be great! Nothing ever happens there. and nothing could be further from the truth. People dont know, people who live in town dont know, no one knows really what it is that we do. For example, we just put a guy in jail for child rape for 12 years. Weve had five rape investigations in the last two years, two of them culminating in prosecutions. Fraud cases have exploded; we get new fraud cases in almost every single day. We still have a fair amount of drug cases. We spend altogether too much time at the schools doing this kind of stuff. But its a busy police department, we do an awful lot of not simply law enforcement but we do an awful lot of social work, family intervention, and its ongoing and its every day. I say Look, I do the same things every other detective does. I just dont do them as often. But Ive handled just about every kind of case that you can imagine, with the exception of murder. There has been one murder in the time that Ive been on the job but I wasnt involved in that. Weve done arsons, weve done armed robberies, weve done all kinds of assault, sexual assaults, all kinds of property crimes, larceny, B&E, everything. It runs the gamut, drugs, all kinds of drugs. So the same things that happen in other communities happen here. There is a perception out there though both within the town and outside as well that this is an idyllic community where nothing ever happens and its perfectly safe. One of the downsides to that is that I believe over the years, its been my experience, that a lot of parents believe that and they think therefore they dont need to be as vigilant with their kids as they actually need to be and thats simply not the case. Sin City and Back Farrell recently got back from Las Vegas. But unlike most people who come back with souvenirs and empty pockets Farrell came back with exactly what hed gone there to get. It was a fraud case that Ive been working on since about 2010. We finally got a guy indicted out there who was in the Nevada National Guard, hes now been dishonorably discharged, apparently. So we got a warrant for him, went out and got him and brought him back and hes now over at the jail on [Route 128] pending trial. Our victim is out $27,000 but its a $10 million [fraud case] that originated in Romania. It was all set up and run from Romania. They would tell you to wire the money and theyd tell you how to wire the money and where and all that kind of stuff. There was two of them, an American and a Romanian, in this country, who just trolled for kids and guys and people who were desperate enough or greedy enough that they would provide bank account information…and then they would wire the money into their accounts, have the person go into the bank, withdraw the money, give it to them, that person would get a cut of it. The guy that sets this all up gets a cut and then the rest of it goes to Romania, the lions share. I got bank pictures of this guy withdrawing the money from Chase Bank, emailed the pictures out to his brigade commander out in the Nevada National Guard who turns out to be a Reno Detective in the sexual assault unit. We got him IDed by his company commander and by a platoon sergeant and then it was just a matter of getting the indictment through a grand jury and then the DAs Office authorized a rendition. So we went out and we picked him up from the Clark County Correctional Facility and brought him back. Its always nice to put an end to something like that. So the two guys, the guy that recruited him and his boss are both in federal custody and one of them has already plead guilty in New York and is pending sentencing and the other one is probably going to go to trial but hes facing like 10 years. The man is currently being held in the Norfolk County House of Correction in Dedham. He is due back in Superior Court March 7, 2012. Follow All Leads Another notable case that we had was we had a home invasion a number of years ago. We got a call one Sunday afternoon and the caller just said Look, Im a federal law enforcement agent, Im not going to tell you who I work for and Im not going to tell you who I am. At 2 oclock in the morning, youre going to have a home invasion at this address and theyre going to take the people hostage. So you dont know whether this is a hoax, you dont know whether to believe this or whatever, but you cant ignore it either. So we set up that night and at 2 oclock in the morning, right on the button, next door to the house that was the target - a woman laying in bed, a flashlight beam goes across her bedroom ceiling and she calls the police to tell us that. She was awake. So then I thought, [Expletive,] this is going to happen! and it did. We had two guys in the house and they spotted one of them and they ran and the chase was on and it went for three or four hours. But we rounded up both of them, we got them both. And one of them particularly was a real bad guy, a real bad guy. Theres a pond in town here that I think still has a gun in it. We were never able to recover it. Satisfaction Guaranteed Ive been relatively lucky. I mean, Ive been punched, Ive been kicked, Ive been spit on. That kind of stuff, but nobody has ever drawn a gun on me. I have drawn mine a couple of times. Since [I started] Ive had more losses than wins but Ive saved to two people with CPR, I prosecuted some domestic violence cases and did it in such a way that Ive had one woman who hugged me in court and say I saved her marriage. But if youre going to be a policeman you need to derive your satisfaction from those intrinsic kinds of things. Because youre never going to get rich as a small town cop thats for sure and youre going to have to work lots and lots of hours and you have to really, really like it, and I do.

13,"- A Nashville man told police a strange and winding tale of hostage-taking and forced drug use after he was arrested for allegedly using a flower pot to break into his neighbors home while wearing only his underwear, according to an arrest report. Residents of a home on Chateau Valley Drive called police just before 4:30 Friday afternoon to report a break-in. The homeowner told police that his neighbor, 28-year-old Wayne Moyher, had used a flower pot and his hands to break through his back door, according to the police report. (For more updates on this story and free news alerts for your neighborhood, sign up for your local Middle Tennessee Patch morning newsletter.) The officers found Moyher, who only had his underwear on, covered in sweat. Moyher reportedly told the officer that multiple men were in his home, holding him and his girlfriend hostage at gunpoint, forcing him to do drugs, and that hed escaped and broken into his neighbors to hide. Moyher then changed his story, police say, and instead said that his girlfriend told him that someone was in the house, attempting to take them hostage. According to the affidavit, when the officer spoke to the girlfriend, she said that, as she watching television, Moyher suddenly jumped through the front window of their home and that no one else was inside the house except for the two of them. The woman told police that shed found a stash of heroin, methamphetamine, suboxone and melatonin she believed belonged to Moyher and that she flushed the drugs down the toilet. Moyher was taken to Skyline Medical Center for treatment of a cut on his hand. He was then booked on charges of vandalism and aggravated criminal trespassing. Image via Shutterstock",1
14,"Southland resident Amy Martinez was walking toward Lathrop Intermediate School before 8 a.m. on Wednesday morning when she was grabbed by a homeless woman, Santa Ana Police said. The suspect wrapped the 12-year-old girl in a one-handed hug and began dragging her away, SAPD Cpl. Anthony Bertangna said. Luckily, a passerby noticed and did not look the other way. The good Samaritan, who has chosen to remain nameless, thought something looked amiss, stopped her car in a parking lot on the Northwest corner of McFadden Avenue and Main Street, and confronted the pair from her open car window, Bertagna reported. All that she asked the girl was, Are you okay? and the victim looked at her and shook her head no, and she could see the fright in her eyes, Bertagna said. After a pause, the good Samaritan listened to her motherly instincts and shouted, Shes mine. Give her back! then, Thats my child! It took three times of her saying that and the woman let her go, Bertagna said. With the child safely in her car, the good Samaritan drove with the child to Lathrop Middle School and phoned police with a description of the disheveled would-be-kidnapper who was found after the police saturated the area and tracked her down. Claudia Hernandez Diaz, 34, was found, arrested and booked on suspicion of kidnapping a minor younger than 14, Bertagna said. Police have not established any sort of motive, he said. The corporal praised the girls rescuer. We always say if you see something say something. Well, she saw something and did something, Bertagna said. According to a report from the Orange County Register, Sandra Martinez, Amys mother, was stunned when she learned of the near-abduction. I have no way to describe how I felt when the principal told me, she told the Register. You dont expect it to happen to you and when it does you dont know how to react. Her mother told the Register that the incident has unnerved Amy, who will be driven to school from now on by a family member. Photo, courtesy Santa Ana Police Department",1

16,"Austin police have arrested a man accused of posing as a ride share driver and allegedly trying to sexually assault two of his intoxicated passengers. Police provided details of the case during a July 3 press conference, saying the incidents date to early June. In each case, two women entered the car driven by Daniel Kifle, 45, after he showed up to give them a drive. In both cases, Kifle is accused of driving off with one of the women as the friend exits the car to help her drunken friend out of the vehicle. The June 3 incident occurred in South Austin after two women got into a black SUV they believed was their ride share picking them up from a bar on West 6th Street, police said. The victim told police the driver drove them to their destination before the drive sped off with the intoxicated female passenger still in the car. The woman left behind called police to identify the man to police, officials said. The near-exact scenario occurred on June 9 in North Austin, where two women were taken after also being picked up outside a West 6th Street bar, according to police. One of the women had fallen asleep in the backseat of the vehicle, and the driver sped off as her friend exited the car to open the other passenger side door to retrieve her, police said. Again, the driver sped off with the passed-out woman still in the backseat, police said, knocking the other woman to the ground. When the woman in the back seat came to, she described later to police that she awoke in the front passenger seat at a parking lot that was not familiar to her, police said. The victim told police the man tried to put his hands down the womans pants before the woman pushed him away while demanding to be taken home, according to the police account. When the driver came to a stop sign, the woman escaped from the vehicle and called police. During the press conference, an officer said a third, similar, incident occurred June 11 in Lakeway. Police at the press conference said they reached out to Lyft and Uber to secure driver coordinates as part of their investigation. But police noted Kifle was not acting in an official capacity as a ride share driver at the times of the pickups, although he did have an account to operate as a ride share driver, the officer said. The incidents prompted Lyft to release a prepared statement on Tuesday afternoon: The situations being described are truly frightening. Our thoughts are with the victims of these senseless acts. These rides did not happen on the Lyft platform, but we have been assisting law enforcement with their investigation and will continue to do so moving forward. In light of the incidents, police urge ride share customers to make sure the vehicle arriving to pick them up matches the description provided by the firm in the app. According to Travis County Jail records, Kifle is being held on charges of kidnapping, aggravated kidnapping and attempted sexual assault, with bail collectively set at $500,000. >>> Image via Shutterstock",1
17,"Three Nassau men were sentenced to jail time on Wednesday for the kidnapping and assault of a Valley Stream man last March in which they handcuffed, stabbed and beat a man and then left him for dead outside a hospital. Jesus Maldonado, 23, of West Hempstead; Jorge Freire-Romero, 20, of Valley Stream; and Jonathan Faneytt, 22, of Valley Stream all pleaded guilty to the charges against them on March 29. Maldonado and Faneytt were both convicted of second-degree kidnapping and sentenced to five years in prison. Freire-Romero was convicted of first-degree assault and sentenced to seven years in prison. This victim was savagely stabbed, pistol-whipped, beaten and kidnapped, and then left for dead outside a hospital, said Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas. This was a horrifically brutal attack and I thank our prosecutors and the police for bringing these defendants to justice. At about 7 p.m. on March 14, 2016, the victim climbed through the window of a house on Jedwood Place in Valley Stream. The victim stated that his girlfriend used to live in the home and he was going inside to gather some of her belongings. The three defendants, who were inside the house, heard him come through the window and immediately caught him and began to assault him. The defendants handcuffed the victims wrists behind his back and dragged him into a bathroom where he was stabbed multiple times. The victim was then tied him to a chair in a living room, blindfolded and pistol-whipped. Following the assault, Friere-Romero called an associate with a car to take the victim to the vicinity of Franklin General Hospital in Valley Stream. When they arrived near the hospital, Friere-Romero removed the victim from the car and stabbed him again multiple times. The victim was left on the ground bleeding, still handcuffed behind his back, but managed to get up on his feet and walk into the emergency room. While in the process of standing up, his clothing came off and when he walked into the ER, he was naked and bleeding from his stab wounds. In total, the victim suffered 11 stab wounds, a collapsed lung and a punctured liver. He has since recovered from his injuries. Nassau County Police interviewed the victim at the hospital. Based on the interview, and additional evidence recovered at the residence, the police arrested all three men. Jorge Freire-Romero, left, Jesus Maldonado and Jonathan Faneytt.

19,"Reports of a familiar, yet scary, scam dubbed a virtual kidnapping have resurfaced in the Washington, DC, area, says the FBI and area police departments. On its Facebook page, the Prince William Police Department warns residents that the scam, which has been around for a few years, is becoming popular again with scam artists. Authorities warned that residents in neighboring counties have also been targeted, as have members of the Archdiocese of Washington, which serves Montgomery and Prince Georges counties. This is how it works: Scammers will call your cell phone and try to extort money by claiming that a family member has been taken hostage. The callers often use accomplices to convince their victims the threat is legitimate. The Washington archiocese said Tuesday that a parent with a child in an archdiocesan school was recently targeted by the virtual kidnapping scam. George Mason University warned its community last week that a student and an employee fell victim to the scam, reports WTOP. »Subscribe to a free email newsletter: BOWIE or like us on Facebook. The caller might try to convince a parent their daughter was kidnapped by having a girl scream for help in the background during the phone call. Another scenario tells the victim that her husband or son has been hurt in a car accident with a gang member, but the gang member will not allow medical care until he is paid for damage to his vehicle. Victims of the scam are told to stay on the phone until money is wired, often to a third party in Puerto Rico. Instructions usually require the ransom payment be made immediately and by wire transfer using Western Union. Ransom payments often range from $600 to $1,900. To avoid becoming a victim of this scam, watch out for: If you receive a phone call from someone who demands payment of a ransom for a kidnapped victim, the following should be considered: If you believe you are the victim of this scam, call the FBI at (202) 278-2000 to report it. If you believe your family member is victim of a real kidnapping, call 911 immediately.",1
20,"Update: Authorities said Thursday they are confident that two bodies discovered by hunters yesterday are the missing Evansdale cousins, Lyric Cook-Morrissey, 11, and Elizabeth Collins, 9. The girls have been missing since July 13. At this time, law enforcement is confident based on evidence at the scene and preliminary investigation that the bodies found yesterday are those of Lyric Cook and Elizabeth Collins, Capt. Rick Abben said, reading from a news release during a news conference at the Evansdale Police Station. However, the results of the autopsy have not yet been made available to law enforcement, and the positive forensic identification of the bodies has not been made. Here is a video of the full press conference. A vigil will be held for the girls tonight from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. across from the Evansdale Police Station. People are encouraged to bring a pink ornament to help decorate a Christmas tree in their honor. The case is being treated as an abduction, and authorities are leaning towards a homicide, but they will wait for information from the state medical examiner to make that determination. Abben said the bodies were discovered at Seven Bridges Wildlife Area, a secluded park along the Wapsipinicon River in Bremer County about 25 miles from where the girls were last seen. The park will remain closed until at least Monday. Multiple agencies will conduct an investigation of that area. Abben said he is not sure if that area had been searched previously. Leads are continuing to come in, and authorities are requesting any tips. A $150,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the capture and conviction of those responsible. Many questions remain unanswered, including how long the girls were at the location and when and how they died.

21,"The suspect in the armed robbery of a Haddonfield Rite Aid that took place last week may have struck again over the weekend. In this instance, the suspect entered the Rite Aid on 121 Center Square Road in Woolwich Township, took a female customer hostage and threatened to shoot/kill her if the pharmacy technician did not give him all of the Oxycodone. According to police, the suspect had a crowbar, but there was no indication he had a gun.

24,"By City News Service A third trial for a U.S. Marine Corps non- commissioned officer accused of killing an unarmed civilian in Iraq nine years ago is expected to begin Monday in a military court at Camp Pendleton. Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins III of Plymouth, Massachusetts was convicted of unpremeditated murder in 2007 and sentenced to 15 years behind bars but that was later reduced to an 11-year sentence. Hutchins conviction was overturned in 2010 because his lawyer was allowed to retire on the eve of trial and again two years ago because his initial confession was deemed to have been illegally obtained. Hutchins is set to be retried again today, according to the Los Angeles Times. Authorities said Hutchins -- then a squad leader of a unit conducting counterinsurgency operations -- took part in a plan to kidnap and kill suspected insurgent Saleh Gowad near Hamdania but grabbed disabled 52-year-old war veteran Hashim Awad instead when Gowads family foiled the plan. Hutchins is accused of masterminding the plan to kidnap and kill Gowad -- who escaped unscathed -- on April 26, 2006, in Hamdania. Some co-defendants testified that the plan was fueled by frustration over Gowad being allowed to go home after questioning. When Gowads family foiled the plan, the four-member snatch team chosen by Hutchins grabbed a neighbor, Hashim Ibrahim Awad, and killed him, according to the prosecution. Awad, a 52-year-old former policeman and father of 11 who walked with a limp, was dragged out of his home and killed in a hail of bullets while bound and gagged in a roadside bomb hole. The government alleged it was Hutchins idea to stage the scene, with a stolen shovel and AK-47 placed by the suspects body to make it look like the man had been digging a hole to plant a bomb, then engaged in a firefight withMarines. Hospitalman Recruit Melson Bacos testified at the first court-martial that the squad leader said, Congratulations gents, weve just gotten away with murder, after the slaying. Seven other Marines and a Navy corpsman were also charged in the case, and none received sentences longer than 16 months. Pvt. John Jodka of Encinitas and Bacos were released after serving time in the brig.",0

26,"[Editors note: The following is the affadavit of Special Agent Daniel R. Genck, submitted as part of the criminal complaint filed against Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The document was converted from a PDF and edited only to remove formatting errors.] I, Daniel R. Genck, being duly sworn, depose and state: 1. I am a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and have been so employed since 2009. I am currently assigned to one of the Boston Field Offices Counter-terrorism Squads. Among other things, I am responsible for conducting national security investigations of potential violations of federal criminal laws as a member of the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF). During my tenure as an agent, I have participated in numerous national security investigations. I have received extensive training and experience in the conduct of national security investigations, and those matters involving domestic and international terrorism. 2. During my employment with the FBI, I have conducted and participated in many investigations involving violations of United States laws relating to the provision of material support to terrorism. I have participated in the execution of numerous federal search and arrest warrants in such investigations. I have had extensive training in many methods used to commit acts of terrorism contrary to United States law. 3. This affidavit is submitted in support of an application for a complaint charging DZHOKHAR A. TSARNAEV of Cambridge, Massachusetts (DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV) with using a weapon of mass destruction against persons and property at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, resulting in death. More specifically, I submit this affidavit in support of an application for a complaint charging DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV with (1) unlawfully using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction (namely, an improvised explosive device) against persons and property within the United States used in interstate and foreign commerce and in an activity that affects interstate and foreign commerce, which offense and its results affected interstate and foreign commerce (including, but not limited to, the Boston Marathon, private businesses in Eastern Massachusetts, and the City of Boston itself), resulting in death, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2332a; and (2) maliciously damaging and destroying, by means of an explosive, real and personal property used in interstate and foreign commerce and in an activity affecting interstate and foreign commerce, resulting in personal injury and death, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 844(i). 4. This affidavit is based upon my personal involvement in this investigation, my training and experience, my review of relevant evidence, and information supplied to me by other law enforcement officers. It does not include each and every fact known to me about the investigation, but rather only those facts that I believe are sufficient to establish the requisite probable cause. 5. The Boston Marathon is an annual race that attracts runners from all over the United States and the world. According to the Boston Athletic Association, which administers the Marathon, over 23,000 runners participated in this years race. The Marathon has a substantial impact on interstate and foreign commerce. For example, based on publicly available information, I believe that the runners and their families -- including those who travel to the Boston area from other states and countries -- typically spend tens of millions of dollars each year at local area hotels, restaurants and shops, in the days before, during, and after the Marathon. In addition, a number of the restaurants and stores in the area near the finish line have special events for spectators. 6. The final stretch of the Boston Marathon runs eastward along the center of Boylston Street in Boston from Hereford Street to the finish line, which is located between Exeter and Dartmouth Streets. Low metal barriers line both edges of the street and separate the spectators from the runners. Many businesses line the streets of the Marathon route. In the area near the finish line, businesses are located on both sides of Boylston Street, including restaurants, a department store, a hotel and various retail stores. 7. On April 15, 2013, at approximately 2:49 p.m. while the Marathon was still underway, two explosions occurred on the north side of Boylston Street along the Marathons final stretch. The first explosion occurred in front of 671 Boylston Street and the second occurred approximately one block away in front of 755 Boylston Street. The explosive devices were placed near the metal barriers where hundreds of spectators were watching runners approach the finish line. Each explosion killed at least one person, maimed, burned and wounded scores of others, and damaged public and private property, including the streets, sidewalk, barriers, and property owned by people and businesses in the locations where the explosions occurred. In total, three people were killed and over two hundred individuals were injured. 8. The explosions had a substantial impact on interstate and foreign commerce. Among other things, they forced a premature end to the Marathon and the evacuation and temporary closure of numerous businesses along Boylston Street for several days. 9. I have reviewed videotape footage taken from a security camera located on Boylston Street near the corner of Boylston and Gloucester Streets. At approximately 2:38 p.m. (based on the videos duration and timing of the explosions) -- i.e., approximately 11 minutes before the first explosion -- two young men can be seen turning left (eastward) onto Boylston from Gloucester Street. Both men are carrying large knapsacks. The first man, whom I refer to in this affidavit as Bomber One, is a young male, wearing a baseball cap, sunglasses, a white shirt, dark coat, and tan pants. The second man, whom I refer to in this affidavit as Bomber Two, is a young male, wearing a white baseball cap backwards, a gray hooded sweatshirt, a lightweight black jacket, and dark pants. As set forth below, there is probable cause to believe that Bomber One is Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Bomber Two is his brother, DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV. 10. After turning onto Boylston Street, Bomber One and Bomber Two can be seen walking eastward along the north side of the sidewalk towards the Marathon finish line. Bomber One is in front and Bomber Two is a few feet behind him. Additional security camera video taken from a location farther east on Boylston Street, as well as contemporaneous photographs taken from across the street, show the men continuing to walk together eastward along Boylston Street towards Fairfield Street. 11. I have also reviewed video footage taken from a security camera affixed above the doorway of the Forum Restaurant located at 755 Boylston Street, which was the site of the second explosion. This camera is located approximately midway between Fairfield and Exeter Streets and points out in the direction of Boylston and is turned towards Fairfield. At approximately 2:41 p.m. (based on the videos duration and the timing of the explosions), Bomber One and Bomber Two can be seen standing together approximately one half-block from the restaurant. 12. At approximately 2:42 pm. (i.e., approximately seven minutes before the first explosion), Bomber One can be seen detaching himself from the crowd and walking east on Boylston Street towards the Marathon finish line. Approximately 15 seconds later, he can be seen passing directly in front of the Forum Restaurant and continuing in the direction of the location where the first explosion occurred. His knapsack is still on his back. 13. At approximately 2:45 pm., Bomber Two can be seen detaching himself from the crowd and walking east on Boylston Street toward the Marathon finishing line. He appears to have the thumb of his right hand hooked under the strap of his knapsack and a cell phone in his left hand. Approximately 15 seconds later, he can be seen stopping directly in front of the Forum Restaurant and standing near the metal barrier among numerous spectators, with his back to the camera, facing the runners. He then can be seen apparently slipping his knapsack onto the ground. A photograph taken from the opposite side of the street shows the knapsack on the ground at Bomber Twos feet. 14. The Forum Restaurant video shows that Bomber Two remained in the same spot for approximately four minutes, occasionally looking at his cell phone and once appearing to take a picture with it. At some point he appears to look at his phone, which is held at approximately waist level, and may be manipulating the phone. Approximately 30 seconds before the first explosion, he lifts his phone to his ear as if he is speaking on his cell phone, and keeps it there for approximately 18 seconds. A few seconds after he finishes the call, the large crowd of people around him can be seen reacting to the first explosion. Virtually every head turns to the east (towards the finish line) and stares in that direction in apparent bewilderment and alarm. Bomber Two, virtually alone among the individuals in front of the restaurant, appears calm. He glances to the east and then calmly but rapidly begins moving to the west, away from the direction of the finish line. He walks away without his knapsack, having left it on the ground where he had been standing. Approximately 10 seconds later, an explosion occurs in the location where Bomber Two had placed his knapsack. 15. I have observed video and photographic footage of the location where the second explosion occurred from a number of different viewpoints and angles, including from directly across the street. I can discern nothing in that location in the period before the explosion that might have caused that explosion, other than Bomber Twos knapsack. 16. I have compared a Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) photograph of DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV with photographic and video images of Bomber Two, and I believe, based on their close physical resemblance, there is probable cause that they are one and the same person. Similarly, I have compared an RMV photograph of Tamerlan Tsarnaev with photographic and video images of Bomber One, and I likewise believe that they are one and the same person. 17. I base the allegations set forth in paragraphs 18 through 27 on information that has been provided to me by fellow law enforcement officers, including members of the JTTT and state and local law enforcement who responded to the crime scenes, as well as on publicly available information that I deem reliable. 18. At approximately 5:00 p.m. on April 18, 2013, the FBI published video and photographic images of Bomber One and Bomber Two on its web site. Those images were widely rebroadcast by media outlets all over the country and the world. 19. Near midnight on April 18, 2013, an individual carjacked a vehicle at gunpoint in Cambridge, Massachusetts. A victim of the carjacking was interviewed by law enforcement and provided the following information. The victim stated that while he was sitting in his car on a road in Cambridge, a man approached and tapped on his passenger-side window. When the victim rolled down the window, the man reached in, opened the door, and entered the victims vehicle. The man pointed a firearm at the victim and stated, Did you hear about the Boston explosion? and I did that. The man removed the magazine from his gun and showed the victim that it had a bullet in it, and then re-inserted the magazine. The man then stated, I am serious. 20. The man with the gun forced the victim to drive to another location, where they picked up a second man. The two men put something in the trunk of the victims vehicle. The man with the gun took the victims keys and sat in the drivers seat, while the victim moved to the front passenger seat. The second man entered the victims vehicle and sat in the rear passenger seat. The man with the gun and the second man spoke to each other in a foreign language. 21. While they were driving, the man with the gun demanded money from the victim, who gave the man 45 dollars. One of the men compelled the victim to hand over his ATM card and password. They then drove to an ATM machine and attempted to withdraw money from the victims account. The two men and the victim then drove to a gas station/convenience store in the vicinity of 816 Memorial Drive, Cambridge. The two men got out of the car, at which point the victim managed to escape. 22. A short time later, the stolen vehicle was located by law enforcement in Watertown, Massachusetts. As the men drove down Dexter Street in Watertown, they threw at least two small improvised explosive devices (IEDs) out of the car. A gun fight ensued between the cars occupants and law enforcement officers in which numerous shots were fired. One of the men was severely injured and remained at the scene; the other managed to escape in the car. That car was later found abandoned a short distance away, and an intact low-grade explosive device was discovered inside it. In addition, from the scene of the shootout on Laurel Street in Watertown, the FBI has recovered two unexploded IEDs, as well as the remnants of numerous exploded IEDs. 23. I have reviewed images of two men taken at approximately 12:17 am. by a security camera at the ATM and the gas station/convenience store where the two carjackers drove with the victim in his car. Based on the mens close physical resemblance to RMV photos of Tamerlan and DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV, I believe the two men who carjacked, kidnapped, and robbed the victim are Tamerlan and DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV. In addition, the carjacker who was severely injured during the shoot-out in Watertown was taken to Beth Israel Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. FBI fingerprint analysis confirms that he is Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and the mans face matches the RMV photograph of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. RMV records indicate that Tamerlan Tsarnaev and DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV share the same address on Norfolk Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. According to Department of Homeland Security immigration records, Tamerlan Tsarnaev and DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV are brothers. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a Lawful Permanent Resident. DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV entered the United States on April 12, 2002, and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. 24. A preliminary examination of the remains of the explosive devices that were used at the Boston Marathon revealed that they were low-grade explosives that were housed in pressure cookers. Both pressure cookers were of the same brand. The pressure cookers also contained metallic BBs and nails. Many of the BBs were contained within an adhesive material. The explosives contained green-colored hobby fuse. 25. A preliminary examination of the explosive devices that were discovered at the scene of the shootout in Watertown and in the abandoned vehicle has revealed similarities to the explosives used at the Boston Marathon. The remnants of at least one of the exploded lEDs at the scene of the shootout indicate that a low-grade explosive had been contained in a pressure cooker. The pressure cooker was of the same brand as the ones used in the Marathon explosions. The explosive also contained metallic BBs contained within an adhesive material as well as green-colored hobby fuse. The intact low-grade explosive device found in the abandoned car was in a plastic container and wrapped with green-colored hobby fuse. 26. On the evening of April 19, 2013, police investigation revealed that there was an individual in a covered boat located at 67 Franklin Street in Watertown. After a standoff between the boats occupant and the police involving gunfire, the individual was removed from the boat and searched. A University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth identification card, credit cards, and other forms of identification were found in his pockets. All of them identified the man as DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV. He had visible injuries, including apparent gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs, and hand. DZHOKHAR TSARNAEVs wounds were triaged and he was brought to an area hospital, where he remains for medical treatment. 27. On April 21, 2013, the FBI searched DZHOKHAR TSARNAEVs dormitory room at 7341 Pine Dale Hall at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, pursuant to a search warrant. The FBI seized from his room, among other things, a large pyrotechnic, a black jacket and a white hat of the same general appearance as those worn by Bomber Two at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, and BBs. 28.

28,"The city of Olivettes police department posts a monthly update on the categories of crime reported to the department each month. Not surprisingly, larceny — theft of personal property — leads the list of crimes broken out by the monthly report, which also tracks assults, burglaries, drug offenses and robberies. The department reported 16 cases of property theft in October, the highest month since Junes 18. A handful of other offenses are lumped into the other category. That category can include crimes such as motor vehicle theft, arson, bad checks, fraud, property damage, sex offenses, DWI and kidnapping, according to the report updated each month by the citys police department. In total, so far, the city has reported 606 serious crimes since the first of the year through the month of October.

29,"A Cinnaminson resident was among 68 cadets who graduated as part of the 17th basic class of police officers from the Mercer County Police Academy on Sept. 28, according to the Mercer County Sheriffs Office. Adam Somers will join the Cinnaminson Police Department. Somers accepted the oath of office for the police department at the Cinnaminson Committee Meeting on Sept. 25 at the municipal building. Three days later, Somers graduated as part of a commencement that was held inside the gymnasium at Mercer County Community College (MCCC) in front of an audience of several hundred family members, friends, and members of a number of law enforcement agencies. Many cadets wore the uniforms of the respective law enforcement agency each will join; two cadets were Alternate Route trainees who attended the academy at their own expense and now can pursue employment as certified police officers. The graduates endured 21 weeks of training at the academy in all aspects of law enforcement and will now serve in many different Police Departments within Mercer County and elsewhere. The Mercer County Police Academy was created in October of 2006, and provides a facility and resources to train law enforcement recruits in Mercer County. The academy is located on the grounds of MCCC. Mercer County Sheriff Jack Kemler wished the graduates good luck and the blessing that they return home safely to their families each night. In return, the community will ask for your continued courage and commitment, and to remain steady in your role – despite any obstacles or threats placed in front of you, Kemler said. Brian Morgenstern, a Montclair resident who will join the New Jersey Transit Police Department, was chosen by his fellow graduates as class speaker. He said that while cadets may have different reasons for pursuing a career in law enforcement, there remains a common thread. For some of us its the pension system; for others its family tradition, Morgenstern said. Its most definitely not for the lavish pay. But theres only one reason thats shared by all police, and that is, we want to help. Its all up to you now, he said to his fellow graduates. I no longer want to be a cop – I am a cop. We are cops. We are police. We are Class 17-17. Also addressing the class were Agent Matt Kemp, Mercer County Prosecutors Office; Police Academy Director Martin P. Masseroni; Prosecutor Angelo Onofri; and Hopewell Township Police Chief Lance Maloney, president of the Mercer County Chiefs of Police Association. Also in attendance were Freeholders Ann Cannon, John Cimino and Pasquale Colavita; and Dr. Mark Harris, Vice President for Finance and Administration at MCCC. During training, the class studied in disciplines such as use of force, firearms, vehicle pursuit, hostage negotiation, advanced crime scene processing, and domestic violence prevention, among others. Several cadets received awards at the graduation ceremony for their excellence in training. Casey Annuzzi, who is joining the Middlesex County Sheriffs Office, was chosen by his classmates to receive the Certificate of Merit awarded by the New Jersey Police Training Commission to the best all-around graduate. Jonathan Erd, New Jersey Transit Police Department, received the academic award; Kevin OBrien, New Transit Police Department, and Preetkaran Singh Middlesex County Sheriffs Office, shared the firearms qualification award with perfect scores; Michael Cruse, Mercer County Sheriffs Office, received the physical training award; and Ryan Hensperger, Alternate Route, received the emergency vehicle operations award. The Mercer Police Academy consists of two classrooms specially designed for the needs of law enforcement training, and recruits use MCCC grounds, its library and its gymnasium for training purposes. The campus includes a padded training room that is used for defensive tactics classes. A shooting range in Hopewell Township operated by the prosecutors office is part of the academy as well. The following is a list of the graduates, their hometowns, and the law enforcement agency each will join: The attached images were provided by the Mercer County Sheriffs Office:  Photo 1, above the story: Brian Morgenstern, who was chosen by his fellow graduates as class speaker, delivers remarks during the Sept. 28 Police Academy graduation exercises.

31,"BRENTWOOD, CA Locked away in a Nevada prison on robbery and kidnapping charges, O.J. Simpson knows police are testing a knife found at his Brentwood home to see if it was used to kill his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. But hes not too worried about it. Simpsons former manager told People magazine Simpson isnt losing any sleep. Everybody Ive spoken with says hes just ignoring it. Hes not talking about it. When he heard the news on TV, all he did was shake his head, as if to say, Will this ever end? Hes definitely shrugging it off and pretty much saying, Im not going to worry about it. Last week Los Angeles Police announced that they are investigating a knife found buried outside the former home of O.J. Simpson. The knife was found at Simpsons mansion at 360 N. Rockingham Ave in Brentwood, California, which was demolished in 1998. A retired LAPD officer claims that a construction worker at the site handed the knife over to him in 2003 and that he tried to turn it over as evidence, but department officials didnt believe it was necessary, according to the Los Angeles Times. The department is testing the knife for fingerprints and DNA traces, which could still linger even years later. It is being treated as we would all evidence. it has been submitted to our lab, LAPD Capt. Andrew Neiman said. The Times, citing unnamed LAPD sources reports that preliminary investigation points to the knife being unrelated to the 1994 murders. Related: O.J.

Quanisha Safara Bell of Smyrna was taken into custody Monday morning, said Lt. Michael Crier, persons investigator with the sheriffs office. She was located around 9 a.m. by Cobb County police walking along Barrett Parkway. Bell has been charged with one count of kidnapping and will soon be transported to the Cherokee County Adult Detention Center, Crier added. Deputies initially responded to a non-parental kidnapping call Sunday evening at a home on Regency Court, which sits off Kellogg Creek Road in unincorporated Acworth. Police were told Aryana Warren disappeared with Bell after she asked the 12-year-olds mother if they could walk to a local store, Crier added. The pair left on foot around 8:30 p.m. July 12. However, Aryana was found around 6 a.m. Monday near Town Center Mall in Cobb County and was returned home, Crier stated.

36,"Noreen Gosch, the Iowa woman whose dogged efforts to uncover the truth about what happened to her son 31 years ago created awareness that led to the establishment of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, is applauding the organizations role in a nationwide FBI sting that led to the rescue of 105 children who had been kidnapped into an organized child sex trafficking ring. That is huge and Im glad they are doing something that has yielded some results that might save some children, said Gosch, whose son, Johnny, vanished from a West Des Moines street corner while preparing to deliver the Des Moines Sunday Register in 1982. But until lawmakers adopt a zero-tolerance approach to offenders, children in Iowa and the rest of the nation remain vulnerable, she said. The last big arrest – 700 pedophiles – across several countries was in 2007; this is 2013, so it doesnt happen often, Gosch aid. But it does give me some hope that they now realize we have a big problem that requires constant vigilance, but also action. Iowa Arrests in Sting Operations Since 2003, Operation Cross Country has resulted in the identification and recovery of 2,700 children who have been sexually exploited, the FBI said. The FBI and its partnering law enforcement agencies say the sting operations have resulted in 1,350 convictions of those seeking to profit from the sexual exploitation of children. Those convictions include a New Jersey man sentenced on sex trafficking and associated charges earlier this month in U.S. District Court for Iowas Southern District. Johnelle Lewis Bell, 29, of Hammonton, NJ, was sentenced to a net term of 360 months in prison, to be followed by five years of supervised release, on the charges, which stemmed from a 2011 Operation Cross County Sting. In the recent sting, 47  FBI divisions took part,  along with more than 3,900 local, state, and federal law enforcement officers and agents representing 230 separate agencies. The FBI did not release the states involved in the sweep or say whether it included any cities in Iowa, but the Des Moines Register reported that 33 people were arrested in Council Bluffs in Iowa and two cities in Nebraska, Omaha and Lincoln. Gosch, who will be recognized next month for her efforts to protect children from exploitation and abuse, said Iowa has a significant kidnapping problem. At the 2012 Preventing Abuse Conference in Des Moines last fall, speakers from National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said that from June to October 2012, there were more than 44 attempted abductions in Iowa. Thats a huge number for a state like Iowa, where so much of the population lives in farming communities and small towns, Gosch said. Thats more than Iowa has ever seen. Successful abductions during that period included Evansdale cousins Lyric Cook-Morrissey and Elizabeth Collins, whose bodies were discovered in December. They disappeared while riding their bikes in Evansdale on July 13, 2013. Iowans Question Why Klunder Was Free In another sensational abduction case in Iowa earlier this year, 15-year-old Kathlynn Shepard of Derby was abducted and killed. The suspect, Michael Klunder, committed suicide hours after he kidnapped Shepard and her 12-year-old friend, who escaped. The girls abductor had a long criminal history, including at least three abductions, leading Gosch and others to question why he was free in the first place. How many will post bail and be back out and only get their wrists slapped, like Klunder? Gosch said in an iinterview with Patch. Iowa Sen. Jerry Behn, a  Boone Republican, has renewed his call for the death penalty for persons convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder, legislation that Gosch and other parents of missing Iowa children support. Klunder was an obvious danger to society, Behn told KCCI this spring after the suspects suicide. He had been sentenced to up to 41 years in prison, but served only about half that time because of Iowas good behavior law. In cases without mandatory sentences, 1.2 days are trimmed from the sentences of inmates for every day they serve without incident. Well, you know, they get life in Iowa, and life is life, Gosch said in the KCCI interview.  Well, apparently not. So I think, maybe some of the legislators would be happy to come forward and give us the reasons why the law works for some people and other are let off. And theyre dangerous criminals, said Gosch. Gosch said she hopes sting operations like the one the FBI announced Monday will become part of the FBIs standard operating procedure. How many children have to perish before these sting operations become standard? she said. if law enforcement officials had taken seriously the intelligence she and her investigators gathered about her sons disappearance, he might have been found, Gosch said. The thing that frustrated me from the very beginning was that they didnt look for my son, she told Patch. They tried to call him a runaway, they threw up obstacles when I hired private investigators and it was my boy who suffered. We didnt see a whole lot of action for years, she said. After her son disappeared, Goschs U.S. Department of Justice  Department testimony was instrumental in establishing the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which provides expert resources to families with missing children and has assisted in the safe recovery of more than 175,200 children in the past 28 years.

37,"A woman died in an Emeryville car crash after a police pursuit and kidnapping investigation that began in San Francisco Sunday afternoon. San Francisco police said a woman was assaulted on Leavenworth and Turk streets shortly before 3 p.m. and forced into a trunk of a vehicle by two suspects. The woman was able to activate the emergency release lever and escape the car in the area of Van Ness Avenue, according to San Francisco police Capt. Carl Fabbri. She is currently in fair condition and is being treated for her injuries in San Francisco, Fabbri said. The suspects continued driving the car onto the Bay Bridge and Interstate Highway 80 toward Oakland, Fabbri said. The pursuit ended at the intersection of W. MacArthur Boulevard and Peralta Street in Emeryville at 3:19 p.m., according to Emeryville police Capt. Oliver Collins. They arrived to find several San Francisco police vehicles on the scene. The suspects vehicle collided with the front of a silver Chrysler, spun around and struck and light pole. The crash ignited the suspects vehicle but the cause of the fire is still under investigation, Collins said. Police extricated the male suspect who was driving the car, but were unable to extricate a female suspect who died. The man was in critical condition following the crash and the adult victim in the silver Chrysler was also treated for injuries. — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock",0
38,"A 33-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of his involvement with a marijuana-related home invasion robbery reported Wednesday on Primrose Court in southwest Santa Rosa, a Sonoma County sheriffs official said. Detectives with the sheriffs office followed investigative leads and took Ruben Hernandez into custody Wednesday in Oakland when he was seen getting out a rented gray minivan in the 3300 block of International Boulevard, sheriffs Sgt. Spencer Crum said. Hernandez was interviewed at the Sonoma County Sheriffs Office, then booked at about 7 p.m. Wednesday into Sonoma County jail on suspicion of robbery, kidnapping, false imprisonment and conspiracy, Crum said. The robbery Hernandez is accused in was reported at about 9:30 a.m. Wednesday in the 3300 block of Primrose Court. A woman told authorities she was confronted by two men in her home — one man reportedly came through the front door, the other through the back door. The men were not wearing masks and the woman knew them from previous contacts shed had with them, the sergeant said. One man had a handgun and held her at gunpoint as they proceeded to tie up her hands and started removing marijuana from her home, Crum said. The woman tried to escape and her adult grandson, who lives on the property, came to her aid, Crum said. He was also confronted by the armed men who proceeded to tie him up at gunpoint as well. The two men loaded a substantial amount of marijuana into a gray Chrysler minivan and drove away, the sergeant said. Detectives followed investigative leads to locate Hernandez. Hernandezs bail was set at $100,000; Crum said Hernandez has since posted a bail bond and was released at 4:20 a.m. Thursday. Hernandez is due in court May 14. Detectives are also continuing to follow-up further leads in this case to try and identify the second suspect, Crum said. Investigators have not determined whether the robbery or the suspects are connected with other home-invasion robberies — one deadly — in Sonoma County over the last three months.

40,"A Highland Park resident accused of trying to kidnap a 12-year-old girl last year remains held at Cook County Jail Wednesday. The same man who allegedly approached the girl while she was waiting for a bus in Niles and asked if she wanted to skip school and hang out with him had been arrested two months prior for reportedly exposing his genitalia in a Wilmette intersection. He was later found guilty of disorderly conduct, according to police and court records. Arthur Zingman, 32, of the 400 block of Central Avenue, was arrested at 7:30 a.m. on May 23 at his house following an investigation into the incident at the Niles bus stop, which took place Oct. 6 of last year in the 7200 block of Conrad Avenue. Police said he told the girl his phone was dead and he was trying to find the nearest restaurant. As the bus arrived, nearby parent who witnessed the incident told the girl to get on the bus. The witness described the mans vehicle and police began a search of the area, but officers did not find the man or the white SUV he was driving. On Jan. 16, police pulled over a vehicle matching the description of the SUV from the incident. Officers identified the driver, Zingman, but were unable to hold the man until the victim or witnesses could verify it was the same man. The next day, the girl and her mother both identified the driver as the man who tried to lure her. On Jan. 18, a witness from the bus stop also identified the driver as the same man. That day, Police tried to find Zingman, formerly of Morton Grove, at a temporary address in Des Plaines, but he had already moved. Prosecutors approved a felony arrest warrant for Zingman on Feb. 16 after to speaking with witnesses and reviewing the evidence, according to Cmdr. Robert Tornabene. The warrant was issued on Feb. 28. About three months later Niles police tracked him down to his home in Highland Park and arrested him on the warrant.  Last August, while living in Morton Grove, Zingman was arrested in Wilmette and charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly exposing himself near the intersection of 11th Street and Greenwood Avenue. Wilmette police said at the time he appeared to be adjusting his pants to prepare to expose himself a second time before he was located later in the day. He pleaded guilty in February. A spokesperson for the sheriffs office said Zingman has paid the required $15,000 cash portion of his $150,000 bail. But because it required electronic monitoring and he had no place to stay eligible for such monitoring, he remained jailed as of June 6 ahead of his next court date on June 16.",0

42,"The death penalty has been recommended by a jury for a gang member convicted of murdering five people at a Long Beach homeless encampment nine years ago, the Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office announced Tuesday. The seven-woman, five-man panel deliberated for about two hours before deciding late Monday that David Cruz Ponce, 37, should be sentenced to death. Ponce will return to court on Nov. 27 for a sentencing setting hearing. Ponce, 37, was convicted Sept. 22 of first-degree murder for the Nov. 1, 2008, shooting deaths of Hamid Shraifat, 41, of Signal Hill; Vanessa Malaepule, 34, of Carson; and Frederick Neumeier, 53, Katherine Verdun, 24, and Lorenzo Villicana, 44, of Long Beach. He was also found guilty of first-degree murder for the March 23, 2009, kidnapping and shooting death of Tony Bledsoe, 18, in the Lancaster area, along with two counts of unlawfully possessing a firearm and another kidnapping count involving Shraifat. Co-defendant Max Eliseo Rafael, 31, also was convicted of the homeless encampment killings. Prosecutors decided against seeking the death penalty against Rafael, who is facing life in prison without the possibility of parole. His sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 16. Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes began her closing argument in the penalty phase of Ponces trial by saying she expected the defense, like the defendants family, to ask for mercy, but the victims received none. This defendant has shown not one drop of mercy, Barnes said. He kills because he likes it ... he loves it, he enjoys it, hes empowered by it, Barnes said, replaying audio clips of jailhouse statements as evidence of Ponce celebrating the killings. He kept newspaper articles, he kept souvenirs, she said. All six (of those shot) were innocent victims who were terrorized by the defendant and Mr. Rafael. The Long Beach victims lived in tents at the side of the freeway and to (Ponce) theyre trash, theyre throwaway ... and thats just wrong, the prosecutor said. Ponce was the ringleader in Long Beach and the only one involved in the Antelope Valley killing, Barnes said. In Long Beach, which she called a bloodbath, a ruthless slaughter, Ponce was after someone he believed had offered evidence in a criminal case. He killed the other four people at the encampment to avoid leaving witnesses behind, according to the prosecutor. Barnes played recordings of Ponce bragging and reliving the details of how he killed his victims. I shot that (expletive) right in the face ... the second one splattered in the back of the tent, Ponce could be heard saying on the tape, recreating each shot with a boom and laughing about the bodies twitching afterward. He talked about how he always aimed for the head to make sure none of his victims were coming back. Thats my signature work, Ponce says in the recording. Headshots, my boy, up close ... no (expletive) hitting their bodies, dome shot. Later, talking about driving back from the homeless encampment to his neighborhood, Ponce says, I was excited, boy, I was happy about it, you know what I mean? He was so happy that he did it again when he killed Bledsoe, Barnes said, shooting the man four times in the back of the head as he was on his knees praying. The defendant killed Tony Bledsoe because Tony Bledsoe owed him 200 dollars from a drug deal, the prosecutor said. This defendant has earned that consequence of the death penalty. Defense attorney Donald Calabria disagreed, calling Ponce a good son and a good father who had been a model prisoner in the five years since his arrest. David Ponce will die in prison. The only issue left is: who decides, you or God?, Calabria told jurors. The death penalty is reserved for only the very worst of the very worst. And David Ponce is not the very worst of the very worst. The defense attorney added: What happened isnt right, but it isnt the crime of the century. Calabria noted that Rafael, who personally shot at least one of the victims, would be spared death. Its not serious enough for the prosecutor to ask for the death of Max Rafael, though Barnes had called them equally guilty during closing arguments for the guilt phase, Calabria said. Calabria pointed to testimony by Ponces family, including his mother Patricia, who begged jurors last week to spare her sons life, and also pointed to testimony by doctors who said the defendant had suffered a traumatic (head) injury at a young age that could have led to learning problems. Hes not an evil person. He has redeeming qualifies. His life is worth saving, Calabria said, reminding jurors of testimony that Ponce talked a nephew out of joining a gang and helped a friend through a teen pregnancy. David Ponce is, when all is said and done, a human being, the attorney said. Look at him as a human being, not as a criminal, not as an animal ... hes not rotten to the core, far from it. Before the closing arguments, the judge polled the jurors to ask whether anyone had close family or friends who had been victims of the shooting massacre in Las Vegas on Sunday night. After the attorneys finished making their case and jurors had left the courtroom, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charlaine F. Olmedo shared a jury instruction she had drafted, at the defenses request, to address that tragedy. A large-scale tragedy recently occurred in Las Vegas, the instruction read in part. Noting that the event was completely unrelated to this case, the judge went on to say that your feelings, thoughts and concerns (about that tragedy) cannot enter your deliberation process. The defense asked the judge to also instruct jurors not to discuss the Las Vegas shooting at all. Ponce and Rafael have remained jailed without bail since being charged in January 2012 with the killings. Jurors found true the special circumstance allegations of multiple murders, murder during the commission of a kidnapping and murder while an active participant in a criminal street gang, along with gang and gun allegations against the two. Ponce has prior convictions for second-degree robbery and receiving stolen property from 2003 and possession of a controlled substance from 2002.

43,"A Hawthorne man linked through DNA evidence to the 2004 killing of a woman in South Los Angeles after his arrest for a fatal hit- and-run in Orange County pleaded no contest Thursday to murder and other charges. Jaqwun Laerin Turner, 36, was immediately sentenced to 34 years to life in state prison following his plea to first-degree murder, kidnapping and assault with a deadly weapon, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office. Turner was charged in 2015 with the April 10, 2004, slaying of Leah Deshay Benjamin, whose body was found wrapped in a blanket in an alley in the 10600 block of South Manhattan Place. The 38-year-old woman died from blunt force head trauma, authorities said. A background check of Turner revealed he had lived in close proximity to the area where Benjamins body was discovered, according to authorities. Los Angeles police were notified in 2014 the California Department of Justice had gotten a match between Turners DNA profile and the DNA profile obtained from crime scene evidence. Los Angeles Police Department Robbery-Homicide Division detectives and members of the Scientific Investigation Division conducted a search of the location where Turner had once lived, and recovered DNA evidence linked to Benjamin although the property had been sold in 2005, according to police. Turners DNA was collected after his arrest by Santa Ana police on Jan. 29, 2014, in the death of Martha Rodenza, 51, of Los Angeles. Rodenza had gotten into a dispute at a family party in Mission Viejo and ended up getting into a petroleum tanker truck driven by Turner after asking for rides at a gas station near Avery Parkway and the Santa Ana (5) Freeway while he was working as a fuel delivery driver, authorities said. Rodenzas body was found on the northbound Santa Ana (5) Freeway at the westbound Garden Grove (22) Freeway after she fell from the truck just before 2:45 a.m. on Dec. 8, 2013. Turner pleaded guilty in August 2014 to a felony hit-and-run charge and was sentenced to a year in county jail and five years probation. Orange County Deputy District Attorney Stephen Cornwell objected to the plea deal, saying later that Turner should have spent time in prison for leaving Rodenza to die alone in the road and failing to contact police.

Officers went over several scenarios on how to identify bank robbers and details during a stressful situation of a robbery. Members of the Active Shooter and Patrol, Hostage Negotiation Team and TAC 30 (the SWAT team) spoke as well. In the case of a take-over robbery that results in a hostage situation, deputy Dick Cooper of the Hostage Negotiation Team, said, If it does happen make sure employees do the obvious and cooperate with the robber, and remain calm. Christian Bartlett, who helped investigate the lastest string of robberies, said, surveillance video has gotten so much better. We can get some pretty clear face shots. During the recent robberies, the Key Bank stills from July 6, showed good shots of the bandaged face of 64-year-old Jack Sexton, who was arrested last week. The robbers, however, wore Halloween masks, including Bill and Hillary Clinton masks for subsequent robberies to disguise themselves. Bartlett said stand-alone banks, like Key Bank at 175th St., the Wells Fargo at 145th and Greenwood Ave., and Whidbey Island Bank on Ballinger Way, which all were robbed this year are more likely to be robbed since they are not in shopping center or mall or inside a grocery store. Employees will be questioned by 911 dispatchers and detectives and the things to look for or be aware of include: a top to bottom description of the person; direction of travel; communication, what did the suspect say; observations immediately after the incident; and evidence preservation after the incident. The bank employees at the seminar said it was helpful and one long-time employee of Whidbey Island Bank said her bank had been robbed about 15 times, about once a year, in her 15 years at the bank. Shoreline Police Chief Dan Pingrey, who manages the personal assistance team for King County Sheriffs Department, which counsels officers involved in shootings, said counseling for bank employees through their employer along with assistance from the Sheriffs Office is available, especially in instance of a take over robbery where a gun is pointed in an employees face.",0

64,"Updated Oct. 3, 2016. MICHIGAN — For all youve read about police killings of unarmed black men, the numbers in Michigan dont support predispositions about officer-involved shootings, according to an ongoing project that depends on verfield crowdsourcing and media reports. Police officers in Michigan have shot and killed 13 Michiganders so far in 2016, according to a project called The Counted by The Guardian. The 13 Michiganders were among 718 people killed nationwide in police conflicts. Of those who died in 2016 encounters with police, eight were white, four were black and one was Hispanic/Latino. The victims included two women, one white and the other black. The Guardian says its project is the most thorough public accounting for deadly use of force in the United States, but is an imperfect work in progress – and will be updated by Guardian reporters and interactive journalists as frequently and as promptly as possible. According to the Guardian report, the U.S. government has no comprehensive record of the number of people killed by law enforcement. Before stepping down as U.S. attorney general in April 2015, Eric Holder described the prevailing situation on data collection as unacceptable. Only one of those killed in Michigan — Hope Elferndink, a 38-year-old white woman — was unarmed.

72,"A nurse held hostage by an inmate at Delnor Hospital in Geneva earlier this month was beaten, tortured and raped, a lawyer for the nurse told reporters Thursday. The news was shared at a press conference at the law offices of Taxman, Pollock, Murray & Bekkerman, LLC, in Chicago — the firm hired by the two nurses held hostage at the hospital on May 13. The firm has filed a civil-rights lawsuit in federal court alleging Kane County employees are at fault for the hostage situation, according to the Daily Herald. At the press conference on Thursday, Murray said corrections staff responsible for guarding Tywon Salters, 21, fell asleep on the job, left him unshackled for long periods of time and were often seen watching TV or on their phones while on duty at the hospital. There was a pattern of conduct by the officers who were supposed to be guarding this inmate that directly lead to this incident, Murray said. The lawsuit filed on Thursday names the Kane County Sheriffs Office, corrections deputy Shawn Loomis and APEX3 security as defendants, according to the Aurora Beacon-News. Beside being sexually assault, the lawsuit also claims one of the nurses was struck by a bullet fired by the Kane County SWAT team. That same bullet ended up killing Salters. Salters was first taken to the hospital on May 8 and was receiving treatment in a room on the third floor of the hospital after he ate a jail-issue sandal and also ingested cleaning fluid, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Murray said Salters, who was in custody at the Kane County Correctional Center on a possession of a stolen vehicle charge, had a lengthy criminal history. He also had been on suicide watch and had tried in the past to harm himself while in custody at the jail. He also had a pattern of manipulative behavior and had been combative in the past, Murray said. With all this different things going on, that should have triggered some sort of heightened protocol within the Kane County Sheriffs system while detaining Mr. Salters at the hospital, he said. However,the opposite happened. On the day Salters escaped, he had once again been unshackled to go to the bathroom, Murray said. He made a move on the guard and took his 9mm handgun. He left the room and was walking naked down the hallway when he came to the nurses office, Murray said. This is when he took the first nurse hostage. He demanded she take off her clothes so he could put them on, Murray said. He physically restrained her, held her at gunpoint and threatened her. At some point, the second nurse came into the room, and Murray let the first nurse go. Murray held the second nurse hostage for three and a half hours, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. He held a gun to her head the entire time, Murray said. She was tortured. She was repeatedly beaten with a gun in the back of her head. She was told she was going to die. She was going to leave in a body bag. He said he was going to shoot his way out. … She was also raped. Kane County Lt. Patrick Gengler, public information officer for the sheriffs office, declined to comment on the lawsuit and a spokesman for the states attorneys office also said they could not comment on pending litigation and investigations, the Daily Herald reports.  After negotiations between Kane County SWAT and Salters deteriorated, the SWAT team entered the hospital room at about 4 p.m. During entry, a Kane County SWAT member fired their weapon, striking Salters. Salters was pronounced dead at the scene. The SWAT officer who shot Salters and the corrections officer who was guarding him have both been placed on paid administrative leave. The Illinois Police Public Integrity Task Force has now been requested to investigate the use of force during the officer-involved shooting, authorities have said. The Kane County Sheriffs Office is conducting an internal review of policies, procedures and protocol regarding the transporting of jail detainees and how detainees are kept under guard while outside the jail, according to authorities. The Illinois State Police are investigating the officers deadly use of force. According to Illinois law, the investigators in an officer-involved death, shall, in an expeditious manner, provide a complete report to the states attorneys office where the death occurred. The Kane County States Attorney will review the ISP report to determine if the use of force was justified.

74,"Mount Vernon resident Javon Roberts, 16, was sentenced Tuesday to an indeterminate term of three and one-third to 10 years in prison in connection with his July 2015 guilty plea on rape charges, announced Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore. The brutal and violent acts this defendant perpetrated against these two victims, one an 11 year old girl, belie the courage displayed by these women in coming forward, said DiFiore in a statement. Additionally, excellent detective work and forensic analysis led to this defendant being held accountable today for the depraved crimes he committed. Roberts pleaded guilty to: According to DiFiore: On October 20, 2014 between 6:30 pm and 7:30 pm the defendant abducted a 23 year old female walking home from work in Mount Vernon. Placing a knife to her throat he attempted to rape her but then determining that they were too exposed at their current location, forced her to come with him to the Grimes Elementary School Building located at 58 South 10th Street. There the defendant forced his victim to perform oral sex on him and then forcibly anally sodomized her multiple times. At the conclusion of the attack, the defendant walked the victim to the corner and let her leave. She immediately notified police who then attempted to locate the defendant to no avail. In the second attack: On December 4, 2014, an 11 year old female was walking home from a Christmas concert at a local library in Mount Vernon at approximately 8:00 pm. The defendant abducted her and once again took his victim to the grounds of the Grimes Elementary School. In a stairwell adjacent to the playground, the defendant pulled out a knife and forced the child to perform oral sex on him whereupon he also raped and anally sodomized her multiple times. When the child screamed in pain, the defendant said Shut up or I will kill you. The entire attack went on for approximately two hours. The victim was eventually let go. Police had no leads. Later, police interviewed the defendant on an unrelated investigation. The water bottle he drank from was handed over to the Westchester County Crime lab. Forensics was able to link the defendant to the two sexual attacks. Although the defendant was tried in Criminal Court, as he was less than 16 years old at the time of the crimes, the defendant is considered a juvenile offender. Assistant District Attorney Michelle Lopez, Deputy Bureau Chief of the Sex Crimes Bureau and Assistant District Attorney Mary Clark-DiRusso of the Child Abuse Bureau prosecuted the case.",0

85,"Inmates armed with baseball bats and iron pipes rioted at a federal prison in Tulsa, taking two guards hostage. Hundreds of inmates rioted for about eight hours at the Great Plains Correctional Facility in Hinton and refused to return to their cells before they were finally corralled by law enforcement officers, authorities said Monday. A fight in the prison yard preceded the riot late Sunday, said Caddo County Sheriff Lennis Miller. Miller said the inmates refused to return to their cells and at one point occupied a building in the complex, which is located about 55 miles west of Oklahoma City. (For more local news, click here to sign up for real-time news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) It was a full-fledged riot, Miller said. About 150 inmates were involved, Miller said. The GEO Group, Inc., the operator of the private prison, estimated Monday that about 400 inmates caused the disturbance in two recreation yards. Miller said prisoners, some toting bats and pipes, took two guards hostage at the outset of the riot, but that both were freed and uninjured. It wasnt immediately clear how the inmates got the weapons, how they were able to get inside one of the buildings or what prompted the riot. Miller said authorities used pepper spray and stun grenades to corral inmates into a soccer field and an exercise yard. The riot ended early Monday after roughly eight hours, authorities said. Pablo Paez, a spokesman for The GEO Group, said in a statement Monday that the prison was secured without serious injury to staff, inmates or law officers. He said the Federal Bureau of Prisons and other agencies are reviewing the incident. The prison houses about 1,900 inmates. Miller says no officers were hurt, but that some inmates were taken to hospitals with unspecified injuries. Oklahomas prison directors have been warning for years about potential problems inside the states overcrowded and underfunded correctional facilities, many of which are old state schools or hospitals that have been converted into prisons. Inside most facilities, recreation rooms, classrooms and other program space have all been converted into makeshift housing units to accompany more inmates. In a presentation to the prison systems governing board last month, Director Joe Allbaugh said state prisons have a rated operating capacity of 17,902 but were currently housing more than 26,000 inmates. You can only push this balloon so far, Allbaugh warned the panel during the presentation. Something is going to pop. In September 2015, four inmates were stabbed to death at a private prison in Cushing in a fight between rival prison gangs that left three other inmates wounded. Last year, a knife fight among inmates at a crowded housing unit at the Mack Alford Correctional Center in southeast Oklahoma last year left one inmate dead and three others wounded. A correctional officer suffered minor injuries in December after a fight broke out among a small group of inmates at the North Fork Correctional Facility in western Oklahoma. A riot at the same facility in 2011 resulted in 46 inmates being sent to the infirmary or hospitals after fighting erupted among black and Hispanic inmates.

87,"Forsyth County sheriffs investigators have tracked down the man who tried to kidnap a toddler Saturday from a Barnes and Noble bookstore. Michael Brandon Fazio, 26, was arrested Sunday and charged with one count of kidnapping, the agency said on its Facebook page. Deputies on Saturday responded to the store after receiving a report that an unknown man physically picked up a 3-year-old male child inside the bookstore at the Collection Shopping Center and tried to leave the store with the child in tow. The father of the child saw the event unfold and intervened stopping the event, the sheriffs office said. The child was not injured during the attempt. Deputies canvassed the area, and obtained surveillance footage of the attempted kidnapping. That video was shared on social media and with local news outlets, and the agency began to receive multiple leads in the case. Fazio is being held at the jail without bond. Sheriff Ron Freeman said detectives continue to investigate Fazios motive, his past history and his actions since the attempted abduction. Im very appreciative of the multiple investigative leads that our citizens provided from our social media posts and the video, he said on the departments Facebook page.

89,"The Shorewood man at the center of a massive police standoff last month is now facing several felony drug-related charges, according to court records. Marquis J. Chapman, 28, was charged Saturday with three counts of manufacturing or delivering heroin, possession of cocaine with intent to deliver and possession of narcotic drugs — all felonies. He is due in court Monday for a preliminary hearing. Authorities staged a drug buy in April where Chapman allegedly sold heroin, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports. Chapmans Shorewood apartment was searched last week, and there police found more than 20 grams of cocaine and less than 1 gram of heroin, the newspaper reports. Dozens of police officers from 10 departments — including a SWAT team vehicle, the bomb squad and Milwaukee County Sheriffs deputies wearing bulletproof vests — responded to a June 21 domestic violence incident on Oakland Avenue. The district attorneys office decided it wouldnt file charges against Chapman in that standoff, but did charge him in connection with a February incident. The massive police response prompted some to say Shorewood police overacted, but Police Chief David Banaszynski defended his departments response following the release of a 911 call detailing Chapmans girlfriend saying she was being held hostage.

92,"In 1985, Kelly Yates was 10 months old. Her sister Kimberly was 3-1/2. When the girls and their mother Elaine disappeared in August, they became the subject of a high-profile search. The girls father, Russell, filed a missing persons report in August of that year. Ultimately, state police issued an arrest warrant for Elaine. She was charged with child snatching. But Yates and the two daughters had disappeared. Then in December of 2016, state police received the tip that Elaine and the children, now grown women, were living in Houston. State police traveled to Texas and on Monday arrested Elaine Yates, formerly of Warwick. She was living under the alias Leina L. Waldberg. She waived extradition and will appear in court in Rhode Island on Wednesday to face child snatching charges from 1985. Col. Ann C. Assumpico, superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police and director of the Department of Public Safety, and members of the Office of the Attorney General, announced the arrest at a press conference this morning. Yates, the missing childrens mother, was described as a non-custodial parent. Kelly Yates and her sister Kimberly were allegedly abducted by their non-custodial mother, Elaine Carolyn Yates, state police said. A felony warrant for Child Snatching was issued for her on Nov. 16, 1988. Ms. Elaine Yates and her two daughters have been missing since the initial missing persons report of August 1985. State police also said based upon the initial investigation, it is believed that Mrs. Yates left home with the couples children due to a domestic dispute. Yates was arraigned in Houston and will be arraigned in Kent County Superior Court Wednesday.

93,"By MAGGIE DEBLASIS, Capital News Service Two days after they should have ended, post-conviction proceedings for Adnan Syedcame to a close earlier this week with no decision in sight. Although hearings were scheduled to end Friday, an extensive list of witnesses kept court in session until Tuesday. It is uncertain how long retired Baltimore City Circuit Court Judge Martin Welch will wait before issuing a ruling in this case. Terri Charles, deputy director of the Maryland Judiciarys Office of Communications and Public Affairs, said the decision could come in a couple weeks or months. At the end of proceedings, Welch thanked everyone and said he would issue a written opinion after looking through all of the evidence presented. Popularized by the podcast Serial, the case of Syed, now 34, has gained much media attention. In 2000, he was convicted of the 1999 murder of fellow Woodlawn High School student and ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee and sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years for first degree murder, kidnapping, false imprisonment, and robbery. A key, unused alibi in Syeds original trial and differing interpretations of cell phone tower records were the principal grounds for the appeal. Legal expert David Irwin testified that the defense, led by the late Cristina Gutierrez, should have investigated the unused alibi deeper than it did. My opinion is, it was a game-changer, he said. [The testimony] wouldve been incredibly important in the outcome of the case. The alibi came from Asia Chapman, whose maiden name is McClain and is referred to that way in Serial, was a senior in high school when she sent two letters to classmate Syed days after he was arrested. In the letters, she offered to account for some time on the date of Lees disappearance thatSyed couldnt remember – including the time coroners previously determined was Lees time of death. Chapmans testimony remained consistent over the years: at around 2:20 p.m. on January 13, 1999, Chapman said Syed joined her in the Woodlawn Public Library, where they talked for about 20 minutes about his recent break-up with Lee. Chapman said she then left with her boyfriend. Sometimes, high school boys are immature, so [Syed] being real mature made it memorable, Chapman said, referring to Syeds discussion of the break-up. Just how cool he was about it. How nonchalant, you could say. Mature. She also said how she didnt realize how important she was to the case until journalist Sarah Koenig created Serial in 2014. Advancements in technology also allowed experts to look at the cell tower records the state used in the original trial in a new light. Prosecutors relied on those records in 2000, alleging two incoming calls placed Syed in Leakin Park, where Lees body was later found in a shallow grave. One expert said his predecessor unknowingly had used unreliable methods to interpret the records. The states expert, however, concurred with the original expert. Both Lees and Syeds families showed support in the courtroom. Lees relatives easily constituted a third of the courtroom on Feb. 4, the morning after the family released its first statement since Lees body was found in February 1999. The immediate family members have decided not to attend this hearing, the Lee family statement read. But we are grateful to all the people who are there and will be there to support us and to give Hae a voice. She is the true victim. The family thanked the state for standing up for us and continuing to seek justice and said thatSyeds conviction was the right decision. Lees family and the prosecutor, Deputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah, also released unexpected statements Saturday, in the middle of the hearings weekend recess, over a conference call closed to most media outlets. Christian Schaffer from Baltimores local ABC news channel tweeted out the statements. The testimony and records that are already in evidence reveal that Syed received a tenacious and dogged defense in 1999 and 2000 by a team of some of Marylands best lawyers, Vignarajah said. To think there was an oops or an oversight back then, let alone a failure of constitutional dimension, is just not consistent with what we are now seeing in the defenses file. The tenacious and dogged defense refers to Gutierrez, whom the current defense referred to as being in declining health during the first Syed trial. According to an investigator hired by defense attorney C. Justin Brown to talk with many of the 83 people with potential alibis that Gutierrezs team put together, only four were contacted at all by someone on the defense and none of them were asked to be an alibi witness. Included on the list were Patricia Jessamy, the states attorney at the time, and prosecutor Kevin Urick; not on the list was Chapman. We proved our case. We did exactly what we said we would, Brown said in his closing statement. I believe we met our burden and that Mr. Syed deserves a new trial.",1
94,"Three people are suspected of murdering a Cloverdale man who went missing nearly three weeks ago, a Sonoma County sheriffs official said Thursday. The missing person case involving Jose Martinez began July 2 when a woman called the Cloverdale Police Department and said she had not seen her father since June 29, sheriffs Sgt. Spencer Crum said in a news release. She thought he may have gone on a fishing trip but got concerned when he hadnt returned and his truck, a white Toyota Tacoma was also missing, Crum said. Cloverdale police issued a BOLO — be on the lookout — bulletin, informing other law enforcement agencies of Martinezs disappearance and providing them with a photo of his truck. Cloverdale police also interviewed several of the missing mans family members and friends. The information received during the interviews suggested Martinez may have been involved in significant marijuana dealings and that lately, hed been receiving threats. ... This was likely more than just a routine missing person case, Crum said. Detectives from the Sonoma County Sheriffs Office were consulted and worked closely with Cloverdale PD in an attempt to locate Martinez. At 6 a.m. Tuesday, a Sonoma County deputy found a truck matching the description of Martinezs parked on Masterson Court and Holiday Street in Santa Rosa. The truck had the license plates removed and they had been swapped out with paper dealer license plates, Crum said, but after running the trucks VIN number it came back as registered to Martinez. Sheriffs detectives responded and began investigating how and why the truck ended up where it did, Crum said. Their investigation, which included interviewing witnesses, led to three suspects: Socorro Sierra, 34, of Healdsburg; Felix Fernando Carreon, 43, of Santa Rosa; and Climmie Smith-Hill, 30, of Santa Rosa. Detectives learned that Martinez and Socorro had significant marijuana dealings and the Sierra had recently threatened Martinez over a disputed business transaction, Crum said. Detectives believe that at about 8 a.m. the day Martinez went missing he went Rays Food Place in Cloverdale, where he was kidnapped from the front of the store by three men in a dark sedan. Martinez was driven to the top of Geysers Road near the Cal Pine geothermal plant, Crum said. Sierra walked Martinez to a remote location by a creek where he shot him to death with a handgun. Sierra walked back to the car where he met with Carreon and Smith-Hill. He drove them back to Santa Rosa and dropped them off. Sheriffs investigators allege Sierra returned to the creek Saturday, June 30, wrapped Martinezs body in a tarp and put it in his car. Sierra then allegedly drove Martinezs body to a marijuana garden in the 2100 block of W. Dry Creek Road in Healdsburg and with the help of Carreon, rented a backhoe and dug a hole about 5- 6 feet deep. It is alleged the pair Sierra and Carreon then placed Martinezs body in the hole and covered him with dirt. Upon developing information about the location of the buried body, sheriffs detectives on Wednesday went there and found Martinez deceased under about 5 feet of dirt, Crum said. Martinezs body was recovered and taken to the Sonoma County Coroners Office where an autopsy will be conducted. All three men are being held without bail at Sonoma County jail on suspicion of murder, kidnapping and conspiracy, Crum said. Carreon has been jailed since July 10 when he was arrested in Santa Rosa on suspicion of drug-related charges, the sergeant said. Sierra was arrested Tuesday in the Safeway parking lot on Guerneville Road when a handgun authorities believe was used in the alleged homicide was found inside his vehicle. Smith-Hill was arrested Wednesday at the sheriffs office following an interview, Crum said.

Walters, 22, of Lithonia was issued a citation on Thursday, Aug. 20 for one count of false representations to police for making up the report, a misdemeanor. Sandy Springs officers initially met with Walters just after midnight June 11. She told police she was walking on an access road to westbound Interstate 285 between New Northside Drive and Northside Drive when a beat up white van with rust about the vehicle pulled up along side of her, according to an incident report. Walters, who told police she walking to her home from her job at Publix on Powers Ferry Road, said the passenger in the van asked if she needed a ride. She responded no, and told police the passenger went to the back of the van, opened a sliding door and grabbed her by the shirt in (an) effort to pull her into the vehicle. Walters said she allegedly pepper sprayed the perpetrator, whom she described as a white male. He eventaully let go of her and closed the door. She allegedly told police the driver -- described as a black male -- and the passenger subsequently left the area by turning south on Northside Drive towards Interstate 285. Police were unable to substantiate Walters claims.

He was lodged at the Washington County Jail on $250,000 bail. Police are still searching for his brother, Cory Bedford. According to the sheriffs office, the Bedford brothers are suspects in an incident in the Oak Hills neighborhood on Oct. 4. Responding to reports of gunfire around 10:15 p.m., Washington County deputies reportedly found two individuals with multiple stab wounds in a badly damaged car in a neighborhood cul-de-sac. The victims reportedly told police theyd earlier been in an altercation with the Bedford brothers at a different location, and that they fled together in the car only to be chased by the Bedfords. The Bedfords allegedly fired multiple rounds into the fleeing sedan, though no one was hit by the gunfire, police said. When the chase ended in the cul-de-sac, the victims were attacked and stabbed several times — though police said the injuries were non-life-threatening. They were both taken to hospital.

101,"Prosecutors in Monterey County announced Thursday that, following the retesting of DNA evidence, they would file charges against a longtime suspect in the 1998 murder of 13-year-old Christina Williams. Charles Holifield, 56, has been incarcerated at Valley State Prison in Chowchilla since 1999 on a third-strike sentence of 25 years to life in prison for attempted kidnapping and threatening a woman in September 1998. Holifields prior strike offenses included forcible rape, kidnapping and assault with intent to commit rape, Assistant District Attorney Jeannine Pacioni said. Christina went missing on June 12, 1998 after she took her family dog for a walk in Fort Ord, where she lived with her Navy family in military housing. Less than an hour later, Christinas mother saw the dog wandering along near the familys home with its leash still attached. A nationally publicized search took place over the next seven months, including a $100,000 reward. On Jan. 12, 1999, Christinas body was found on the grounds of a University of California nature preserve 3 miles from where she was last seen. Police from the Presidio of Monterey worked with the FBI, the Local Naval Criminal Investigations Service and Monterey County sheriffs investigators, along with other law enforcement agencies and investigated the case for almost 20 years. Last year, a Monterey Peninsula cold case review team including police from Carmel, California State University at Monterey Bay, Marina, Monterey, Pacific Grove, Sand City and Seaside, the District Attorneys Office, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the California Highway Patrol worked together to identify new leads and reexamine crime scene evidence, including DNA testing of specific items. At a news conference Thursday, Monterey County District Attorney Dean Flippo said Holifield had been a suspect almost from the beginning, and had been interviewed by law enforcement, but only with the new DNA results did prosecutors believe they had sufficient evidence to charge him with Christinas murder. Flippo said Holifield would be eligible for the death penalty, but that prosecutors would not announce whether they would pursue the death penalty until after the preliminary hearing. As of Thursday afternoon, Holifield had not been notified of the pending charges, Flippo said, which will be filed April 14. --Bay City News/Image courtesy of In Memory of our Daughter CHRISTINA MARIE WILLIAMS website",0

Several patrol cars rushed to the scene, along with the hostage negotiation team, cordoned off the block and asked neighbors to remain inside. By just after 4:00 p.m., the man was sitting on his sofa with a knife or sword between his legs and refusing to move, police reported. Several loud booms could be heard from inside the house as officers broke down the door and used non-lethal flash grenades and a Taser to subdue the man. He was taken in a squad car to a psychiatric facility. Trim said it wasnt the first time the department had received a call about an incident at the house. In this type of situation, where youre uncertain of a persons mental state and dont know if there are any other weapons inside, its much safer for officers to set up a perimeter and call for reinforcements, Trim said. Huan and Andrew Nguyen, cousins who were hanging out in a garage on nearby Modena Way when the fire broke out, said they didnt know the man in number 8417 personally but had seen commotion at the house before. We saw him throw a desk out the window a couple of times, Andrew Nguyen, 23, said. The cops were there then, too.",0
105,"A suspect involved in a standoff that slowed traffic on the Bay Bridge for nearly six hours overnight had attacked a woman near the Transbay Terminal a short time earlier, San Francisco police and California Highway Patrol officials said Thursday. San Francisco police said the attack was reported at 10:41 p.m. Wednesday, after the suspect, a 21-year-old man, tackled a 22-year-old woman in the area of Main and Howard streets and refused to let her go. The man allegedly bit the woman on the arm and had to be pulled off of her by bystanders before he fled on foot. The CHP began receiving reports of a pedestrian walking on the left shoulder of the bridges eastbound lanes shortly after 11 p.m. Callers reported the pedestrian was jumping toward vehicles and putting orange traffic cones into lanes of traffic. San Francisco police advised the CHP that he might be the same man wanted in the earlier assault and advised that he should be considered violent, according to CHP Officer Victor Ruiz. The CHP found the pedestrian in the left eastbound lane west of Treasure Island and began ordering him to stop through a loudspeaker. Officers moved in and attempted to detain him but shot him with a Taser stun gun after he made what they believed to be furtive movements as if reaching for a weapon, Ruiz said. The suspect ran east and jumped over the north bridge railing, landing on an external structure of the bridge. He stayed there until around 5:30 a.m., when hostage negotiators successfully talked him into coming back over the rail. The suspect, whose name has not yet been released, was then taken into custody without further incident. Up to three lanes of traffic were closed at some points during the incident, according to the CHP. All lanes reopened by around 5:40 a.m. By Bay City News Service / Bay Bridge photo by Caltrans",0
106,"The man who attempted to barricade himself from Miami-Dade police on Wednesday afternoon in northwest Miami-Dade was wanted in connection with a horrific Broward County murder in which the victim was found stuffed inside the trunk of a burning car. Police said that Jeffrey Harrell eventually surrendered inside a home in the 8300 block of NW Fifth Ave following the hours-long standoff. The 28-year-old Harrell was to be extradited to Broward County where he will be charged with first-degree murder in connection with the Nov. 14 murder of Darren Butler. Wednesdays standoff began when Miami-Dade police attempted to serve a warrant on Harrell along with the Broward Sheriffs Office fugitive task force and the U.S. Marshals Service. He decided to barricade himself and then our hostage negotiators were called out, Detective Argemis Colome of the Miami-Dade Police Department told Patch. Eventually our Special Response Team went in and got him. Harrell was the third suspect to be arrested in the case. Johntavis McCoe, 26, was also taken into custody in Miami on Nov. 21 and Rougiena Deriveire, 18, was arrested on Nov. 18, according to BSO.

107,"A Somerset County man was sentenced to serve 23 years in prison for the brutal rape and beating of a Highland Park woman, who had her child with her, in February, Middlesex County Prosecutor Andrew C. Carey announced. As part of the sentencing, Brandon Cox, 23, of the Somerset section of Franklin Township will serve his time in a New Jersey state prison subject to the No Early Release Act. As such, Cox will have to serve 85 percent of the term before he can be released on parole.

Cox must register as a Megans Law sex offender and will also placed on parole supervision for life upon his release from prison. Police said Cox grabbed the woman as she was walking, showed her a gun and dragged her into the basement of a nearby apartment building, where he punched her repeatedly and then raped her. The woman was walking her child in a stroller at the time of the attack. The child, reportedly a baby, was unharmed and the woman escaped, running to a neighbors home on Harper Avenue and pounding on the door. Her face was covered in blood. The woman was taken to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick.

108,"A Pennsylvania man has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison for his role in a kidnapping and jewelry store robbery in Fairfield in 2013. Jeffrey Houston, 30, of Allentown, Penn., also received three years of supervised release following the 90-month prison sentence, U.S. States Attorney Deirdre M. Daly announced in a press release. Houston was part of a group that stormed into a Gravel Street apartment in Meriden and bound four people on April 11, 2013, according authorities. Houston, Kasam Hennix, William Davis and Christopher Gay were all wearing masks and gloves and two were armed with handguns. The victims were bound with duct tape and their heads were covered with pillowcases, towels and jackets. (To sign up for Fairfield breaking news alerts and more, click here.) Houston, Hennix and Davis then forced two of the victims into a victims vehicle and drove to Lenox Jewelers in Fairfield, where the two victims worked. Timothy Forbes traveled to Fairfield in a separate vehicle, and Gay remained in the Meriden apartment to guard the two other victims. After Houston, Hennix and Davis arrived at the Fairfield store, they stole jewelry, watches and loose diamonds with a total replacement value of more than $3 million, Daly wrote in the press release. They then fled in the victims car, leaving the two victims bound inside the store. Houston, Hennix and Davis abandoned the victims vehicle and got into Forbess vehicle. One of the defendants called Gay to advise him that they had successfully carried out the robbery and that he should leave the apartment. The defendants then fled the state. The five defendants were arrested in May 2013. Investigators determined that Houston, Forbes and Gay had traveled from Pennsylvania to Connecticut on several occasions in the weeks prior to the robbery in order to track the victims movements between Lenox Jewelers in Fairfield and their residence in Meriden. In addition, Forbes and Gay placed a GPS on one of the victims vehicles in an effort to make it easier to track him. On Dec. 8, 2015, Houston pleaded guilty to one count of interference with commerce by robbery and one count of use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. Forbes, of Allentown, Hennix, of Easton, Pa., Davis, of Allentown, and Gay, of the Bronx, N.Y., also pleaded guilty to federal charges. On April 17, 2015, Davis was sentenced to 176 months in prison; on January 27, 2016, Gay was sentenced to 102 months in prison, and, on February 8, 2016, Hennix was sentenced to 171 months of imprisonment. Forbes awaits sentencing. The defendants have been ordered to pay restitution of more than $3.1 million, and have forfeited gemstones, jewelry, watches, a vehicle, and more than $127,000 in cash seized from them at the time of their arrests, according to Daly.

109,"A probationer who allegedly held family members hostage at a Temecula-area property and was shot by sheriffs deputies following an hours-long standoff was released on his own recognizance Monday after two months in custody, and is next due in court in late April. Robert Scott Utley, 59, is facing two counts each of false imprisonment and assault with a firearm, as well as one count of elder abuse and a sentence-enhancing allegation of using a gun in the commission of a felony. The defendant had been held in lieu of $200,000 bail at the Byrd Detention Center. Based on a defense motion and a favorable pretrial services report, Riverside County Superior Court Judge Kelly Hansen ruled that Utley could be released on his own recognizance -- with no bond requirement -- subject to supervision by the Department of Probation. Hansen scheduled a felony settlement conference for April 24 at the Southwest Justice Center in Murrieta. Hansen was arrested Jan. 4 in the 47400 block of Sandia Creek Drive, in the unincorporated community of De Luz, just west of Temecula. According to sheriffs Sgt. Chris Willison, deputies were called to the 20-acre property about 4 that afternoon to investigate a domestic disturbance and learned that Utley was allegedly armed and threatening to harm anyone who attempted to approach the residence -- or leave the premises. A man and woman were holed up in a guest house, while Utley was in the main residence, Willison said. Attempts to negotiate with Utley failed, and a sheriffs SWAT detail was summoned to subdue the defendant, according to the sergeant. SWAT members made multiple attempts to contact Utley, but he refused to exit peacefully, Willison said. The deputies stormed the house shortly after 11 p.m., opening fire on the probationer, who suffered minor gunshot wounds. No deputies were injured. Utley was taken to a Inland Valley Medical Center in Wildomar for treatment and recovered from his injuries. He was booked into the Murrieta jail days later. According to court records, the defendant has prior misdemeanor convictions for vandalism and reckless driving. — By City News Service / Patch file photo by Renee Schiavone",0

112,"Seagrams liquor heiress Clare Bronfman and founding members of an upstate sex cult that left women branded were arrested, Brooklyn federal prosecutors announced. Bronfman is expected to be arraigned in Brooklyn Federal Court Tuesday afternoon for helping Smallville actress Allison Mack and Keith Raniere, both accused of recruiting women into Nxivm, to kidnap and steal from their victims, prosecutors said. The Albany heiress allegedly stole money from a dead womans bank account, hacked emails of people perceived enemies and critics of Raniere, and held his former lover hostage for two years because the woman supposedly entertained romantic feelings for someone other than the cult leader, according to the U.S. Attorneys office. Bronfmans attorney, Susan Necheles, dismissed the U.S. Attorneys Offices charges that her client had broken any laws through her connection to Nxivm. Nxivm was not a criminal enterprise but instead was an organization that helped thousands of people, the heiress attorney said in a statement. The charges against Clare are the result of government overreaching and charging an individual with crimes just because the government disagrees with some beliefs taught by Nxivm and held by Clare. Nxivm co-founder Lauren Salzman, her mother Nancy and bookkeeper Kathy Russell were also arrested and are slated to be arraigned in Albany Federal Court, prosecutors said. The four women have been charged with racketeering conspiracy for their part in an operation that resulted in sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy charges for Raniere and Mack, who recruited women to a purported self-help group in Albany that was instead a sex cult, said prosecutors. Mack, 35, helped create a program called The Source, which recruited actresses whom Raniere entered into a secret society, dubbed DOS, that turned the women into slaves and forced them to recruit others, prosecutors said. The cult forced women to get the groups symbol branded on their pelvic area, endure sleep deprivation, starvation diets and ice-cold showers, the New York Post previously reported. Mack allegedly forced women into sex acts with Raniere, threatening them if they didnt comply, in exchange for financial benefits from Raniere, authorities said. She even reached out to Emma Watson and Kelly Clarkson on Twitter to try to get them to join, the New York Daily News reported. Keith Raniere was the leader of a racketeering conspiracy in which he and members of his inner circle committed a broad range of serious crimes from identity theft and obstruction of justice to sex trafficking, all to promote and protect Raniere and Nxivm, stated Richard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. This Office and the FBI will continue to investigate and prosecute those who prey on others to such destructive effect. Nxivm has since relocated to Brooklyn and members were preparing for war, the New York Post first reported. Branfman — daughter of the billionaire and former Seagram chairman, Edgar Bronfman — and her sister allegedly gutted their trust funds and handed over as much as $150 million to the cult, Vanity Fair reported in 2010.

113,"Homemade guns, similar to the ones assembled by a 21-year-old Lafayette man who killed a 19-year-old woman at her home in Walnut Creek last month, are becoming more common, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday. Were starting to see more and more of them, said ATF spokeswoman Helen Dunkel. Its been a trend over the last couple years in our division. The San Francisco field division covers an area extending from Bakersfield to the Oregon border, she said. Its perfectly legal for someone who is not otherwise prohibited from owning firearms -- convicted felons, for example -- to assemble their own gun, Dunkel said. Certain types of guns cannot be lawfully assembled at home, including automatic machine guns, silencers, sawed-off shotguns and short-barreled shotguns, according to Dunkel. Those types of weapons are considered more dangerous and are required to be registered to lawfully possess one, she said, adding that users must also pay a federal tax. As long as its not in that category, you, who has no record, can manufacture a firearm. Thats precisely what police said Scott Bertics did before taking two homemade guns to the home of Walnut Creek resident Clare Orton, killing her and then killing himself. The two had previously been in a dating relationship, police said. Homemade firearms have turned up in several high-profile cases in California in recent years, including the 2013 shooting spree in Santa Monica that ultimately killed six people, including the shooter, John Zawahri, Dunkel said. She also pointed to the 2014 Bank of the West robbery, kidnapping and shootout in Stockton as another incident where authorities recovered an improvised gun. This might be an avenue for people who are prohibited from buying firearms to circumvent the background check, Dunkel said. But, as long as youre complying with state law, its not unlawful to make a homemade gun. State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles) introduced a bill last year that would have required people who make their own guns to register the firearms and attach a serial number to the devices. The bill passed the House and the Senate but was vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown. In a veto message dated Sept. 30, 2014, Brown said he appreciated the authors concerns about gun violence, but cant see how adding a serial number to a homemade gun would significantly advance public safety. Asked if the governor still held this view - given the recent murder suicide in Walnut Creek - spokeswoman Deborah Hoffman said, The veto message speaks for itself. A spokeswoman for de Leon said the senator wasnt planning on reintroducing the bill. Its still unclear however, why Bertics crafted his own handguns when he could have simply purchased one. The minimum age to purchase a handgun in California is 21, according to the California Bureau of Firearms. It certainly would have been a lot easier, Dunkel said. Detectives found nothing in their investigation to suggest anyone was involved in or had knowledge of Bertics plan, police said. Officers responded at 6:50 a.m. on July 21 to a home in the citys north Homestead neighborhood on a report of shots fired, police said. Officers arrived to find the pair dead from apparent gunshot wounds in the home where Orton lived with her family, according to police. Police have ruled the case a murder-suicide. Orton was a Las Lomas High School graduate and captain on the schools cross country team, according to the schools newspaper, Las Lomas Page. She was living at home during summer break after finishing her freshman year of college at San Diego State University, where she was an honors student studying environmental engineering, according to university spokesman Greg Block. Bertics, an Acalanes High School graduate and a member of the schools cross country team, had enrolled at Stanford University in the fall of 2012 but took a voluntary leave of absence in the fall of 2014, according to university spokesman Brad Hayward. Hayward said Bertics had not yet declared a major, but he is listed on a 2013 demonstration called Controlling Robot Dynamics with Spiking Neurons. Hes also acknowledged in a paper titled, Developing Articulated Robots in Task-Space with Spiking Silicon Neurons. --Bay City News",0

115,"A member of a Lawrence-based kidnapping crew who held two victims in Manchester, NH, overnight was sentenced for his role in a frightening 2012 kidnapping, the US District Attorneys Office said. Thirty-three-year-old Gadiel Romero, a/k/a TC, was sentenced in federal court in Boston to 23 years in prison and three years of supervised release. Romero had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit kidnapping. Romero was caught as part of a wide-ranging investigation into violent kidnapping and and home invasion crews in Lawrence known as joloperros, which roughly translates to stick-up guys. The Department of Justice said that on July 23, 2012, the crew - armed with firearms and wearing police t-shirts - kidnapped two men at gunpoint on Allston Street in Lawrence. The victims were held overnight in Manchester NH, where one was burned with a hot iron. Law enforcement rescued the victims shortly after. Several cooperating defendants told authorities that kidnapping was one of several executed or attempted in the area that year. The crews that were part of the investigation would kidnap drug dealers for large ransoms paid in cash or drugs, believing that dealers wouldnt cooperate with law enforcement. They stashed their victims in safe houses and used sophisticated tracking techniques and devices to follow their victims, the DOJ said. Numerous victims said they were abducted, tortured, and forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in ransom. They were marked with burns, scars, bruises, or other injuries. More than 20 people have been convicted of kidnapping-related offenses or being associated with members of the joloperros since the investigation started in 2012. Law enforcement seized dozens of firearms, including shotguns, GPS devices, irons used to torture victims, masks, zip ties, t-shirts with the word police on them, fake police badges, handcuffs, and drugs, the DOJ said. Romeros group, which the US Attorneys Office said was a violent, sophisticated kidnapping crew, included Danny Veloz, a/k/a Maestro, Jose Guzman, a/k/a Cano, Jose Matos, a/k/a Boyca, and Luis Reynoso, a/k/a Prieto, all of Lawrence; Henry Maldonado, of Manchester, NH, and Thomas Wallace of Raynham, NH. Matos was previously sentenced to 12 years in prison. Guzman, Maldonado, Wallace and Reynoso are scheduled to be sentenced in October 2017. Veloz is scheduled to stand trial on Aug. 7, 2017.",1
116,"A gang member was sentenced to death Thursday for the murders of five people at a homeless encampment near a Long Beach freeway in 2008 and the shooting death of a man in the Lancaster area in 2009. The Los Angeles Superior Court jury that heard the case against David Cruz Ponce, 37, recommended Oct. 2 that he be sentenced to death for the crimes. Co-defendant Max Eliseo Rafael – who was convicted of the homeless encampment killings but was not charged with the Lancaster-area killing – was sentenced Jan. 18 to five consecutive life prison terms without the possibility of parole. In sentencing Rafael, Judge Charlaine Olmedo called the circumstances of the crime particularly cruel and vicious and told the 31-year-old defendant that he will have a long time to think about what transpired. She noted that Rafael had denied responsibility for the attack. Ponce and Rafael were convicted last Sept. 22 of first-degree murder for the Nov. 1, 2008, shooting deaths of Hamid Shraifat, 41, of Signal Hill; Vanessa Malaepule, 34, of Carson; and Frederick Neumeier, 53, Katherine Verdun, 24, and Lorenzo Villicana, 44, of Long Beach. Along with the five murders, Ponce and Rafael were convicted of kidnapping Shraifat. Jurors found true the special circumstance allegations of multiple murders, murder during the commission of a kidnapping and murder while an active participant in a criminal street gang, along with gang and gun allegations against the two. Ponce was also convicted of first-degree murder for the March 23, 2009, kidnapping and shooting death of Tony Bledsoe, 18, in the Lancaster area, along with two counts of unlawfully possessing a firearm. After Rafael and Ponce were charged in January 2012 with the killings, then-Long Beach Police Chief Jim McDonnell said, Id like to make it clear that these victims were not targeted because they were homeless ... This encounter stemmed from a personal vendetta of one of the suspects as the result of an ongoing dispute with one of the victims over narcotics. The other victims were killed to ensure that there were no witnesses to this crime. At Rafaels sentencing, the judge cited jailhouse statements made by Ponce and Rafael, saying those were very damaging evidence against the two. Really, its their own words that provide the sufficiency of the evidence ..., Olmedo said then. One of Ponces attorneys, Robert A. Schwartz, told jurors during the trial that the surreptitious tape recordings of conversations between Ponce and Rafael were made in the upside-down world of county jail in which inmates status and reputation are enhanced by claiming to have been involved in crimes. Ponces lawyer maintained there was no physical evidence connecting Ponce to the killings; that his clients jailhouse statements were riddled with lies and misstatements showing he wasnt there; and that a lot of information about the slayings was available in media accounts. Rafaels attorney, Marc Lewinstein, had suggested the statements made by his client were false bravado rather than actual admissions. Max Rafael is not a murderer, Lewinstein told jurors during the trial. City News Service; Image via Shutterstock",0
117,"After an evening of dinner and movies at home with her new boyfriend two years ago, Kristina Baltrimaviciene walked Teymur Huseynli to his car. Testifying in a DuPage County courtroom Tuesday, Baltrimaviciene spent a few hours describing to a judge and jury what happened on Nov. 16, 2012, how her life filled with terror and heartache as her ex slit her new beaus throat before her eyes. Joseph Spitalli practically took his head off, Assistant States Attorney Kirsten King said. Baltrimavicienes white parka was sprayed with Huseynlis blood. The parka was presented as evidence. I felt the hot blood on me, the 30-year-old woman told jurors through tears via an interpreter, as quoted in the Chicago Tribune. Spitalli, 36, of Darien, is on trial for first-degree murder and kidnapping. DuPage County prosecutors say Spitalli never got over his breakup with Baltrimaviciene. They met through an online dating site, and they broke up after a year because they argued too much. In September 2012, she tried to get an order of protection against Spitalli because she was afraid of him, but a judge denied the request in October, saying there wasnt enough evidence. Baltrimaviciene, a Lithuanian immigrant, began seeing Huseynli, a 31-year-old Azerbaijani immigrant who came to the United States in 2010, whom she met on the same dating site. Theyd been dating for about three months. Spitalli laid in wait for the young lovers and approached them with a kitchen knife. At first, he asked for money, according to authorities and Baltrimavicienes testimony, and then he shoved the new boyfriend and they traded words. Huseynli tried to walk away, and Spitalli attacked while his back was turned, according to prosecutors. Leaving Huseynlis body on the front lawn of the Wildwood Court apartments, Spitalli then forced her into his car and drove to his parents, where he concocted a story about being attacked by two black guys and said Baltrimaviciene came to him for help, according to prosecutors. If she didnt lie, prosecutors said, hed kill her and her daughter. His parents called 911, but Baltrimaviciene eventually told police and paramedics what really happened and Spitalli was arrested. The 911 call was played in court Tuesday. Huseynli came to the United States to study English and computer science, according to his friends. They called him by his nickname, Tima, and said he was shy and sweet and made friends easily. A few months after Spitalli was arrested and held in jail without bail, authorities recorded him conspiring to hire a hitman to kill Baltrimaviciene, suggesting she die in a car crash or a heroin overdose. He also was recorded plotting to breaking out of jail. In court Tuesday, his lawyers argued that the stabbing death of Huseynli was an accident. Two years ago, Spitalli told police he blacked out when he saw Huseynli kiss his ex girlfriend. After Huseynlis body was sent back to his parents in Azerbaijan for burial, his friend Baghir Hamidov told the Tribune that he and other friends would attend every court hearing on behalf of his family. Well make sure justice takes place and that the person responsible does not find a crack to slip through, Hamidov said.",0

According to police spokesman Dana Pierce, the young girl was walking her dog northbound on Darnell Road near Barber Road between 7 and 7:20 a.m. Thursday. The girl told police that a newer-model, single cab white pick-up truck with scratches on the rear and right side drove past her and then stopped on Barber Road. When the girl and her dog walked past the stopped truck on their route, the driver allegedly exited his truck and grabbed the girl by the wrist. The dog bit the suspects ankles, which caused him to let the girls arm go. The girl told police that he drove away northbound on Darnell Road.

123,"Camden County Police are looking for information about an attempted kidnapping that occurred Tuesday morning in the 100 block of Sixth Street in Camden City. At 9:30 a.m., police said two men wearing full-body robes and head coverings went into the Zoujati Salon where a woman was working alone. They then allegedly stuffed her into a trash can under threat of force, and put the can out on the sidewalk with the woman still inside. From there, police say one of the men entered a white, late-model Chevrolet Express 1500 cargo van with tinted windows and stolen Pennsylvania license plates (JLJ 6784). The other reportedly ran a block before he was picked up by the driver of the van, and the two proceeded over the Ben Franklin Bridge into Philadelphia, police said. The victim was taken to Cooper University Hospital for treatment and was released. Police were unable to confirm whether the kidnapping may have been gang-related; a spokesman for Camden County said the incident is under investigation. Authorities did confirm that the pair fled the scene, leaving the woman behind; they theorize that the act may have been spotted in what is a highly trafficked area, and abandoned their plan Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call the Camden County Police tip line: 856-757-7042.",0
124,"A Bolingbrook woman who plunged a knife into her husbands chest might get off with probation after pleading guilty to a reduced charge of second-degree murder. Michele Evans, 52, had been charged with first-degree murder for killing her husband, 55-year-old David Evans, in April 2015. Michele Evans stabbed her husband in their Bloomfield Drive home. He died soon after at Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove. Michele Evans posted a $1 million bond for her release from the Will County jail a month after she killed her husband. Twice since her release, she petitioned for protective orders against a man who moved into her marital home with her after her husbands death. Michele Evans accused this man, 53-year-old John Hollyfield, of menacing her and holding her hostage. Over the last month that John has moved in with me, he has become verbally and physically abusive to me, Michele Evans said in one of her petitions. He will throw things, he has picked up my crutch and waived (sic) it at me threatening me with it. Michele Evans sentencing was scheduled for May 22. She will no longer have to take drug tests prior to her court appearances. Evans failed a test for cocaine in October and ended up back in jail for a month and a half.

126,"- It was the wrong Manuel Villa. The El Paso, Texas, man -- whose age was not given -- was taken into custody March 17 after having a medical incident in the street. Unfortunately, Villa shared the same relatively common name as a Colorado Department of Corrections inmate who slipped free from his shackles and escaped more than 20 years ago. Manuel Villa of El Paso was extradited to Colorado and held in custody in the Colorado Department of Corrections for more than two weeks until routine fingerprinting revealed he was not the right person. A statement from CDOC said Villa would be sent back to Texas. At the time of his arrest, El Paso police said they believed Villa was the escaped prisoner, hiding in plain sight in El Paso. The man arrested was described as a panhandler who had a medical crisis in the street. Apparently [Villa] was bent over, said Sgt. Enrique Carrillo, a spokesperson for the El Paso Police Department describing Villas arrest on Denvers Channel 9 Tuesday. Someone believed he was having some kind of distress. Our officers went to check on him and while doing so ran his ID and find out hes wanted out of your jurisdiction there in Colorado. Channel 9 later corrected their story. Carrillo did not respond immediately to a phone message left by Patch via the El Paso police department. The Colorado Manuel Villa, who would now be 62, was being held at Limon Correctional facility after being convicted for theft, robbery, kidnapping and burglary out of Arapahoe, Denver and Chaffee counties. Villa escaped from DOC custody in 1996 by jumping out of a medical van on the way to the Rose Medical Center for treatment of a knee injury news reports said.

129,"Police chiefs across Middlesex county and beyond are alerting residents and local business owners about the threat of malicious software, or malware, that may compromise computer systems or hold files hostage for ransom, according to a series of press releases from John Guilfoil Public Relations. The latter, called ransomware, is the focus of a worldwide criminal investigation after hundreds of thousands of systems running Microsoft Windows were compromised on May 12, including hospitals, transit stations, and private computers. The attack, named WannaCry encrypted files on victimized systems and demanded a $300 to $600 payment to unlock the files. The attack was stopped, but authorities fear that another wave of attacks may be coming this week. Police departs are offering the following tips to help prevent infection on your computers and devices: • Restart your Computer. This sounds like Technical Support 101, but its an extremely important step. Restarting a Windows PC often allows it to install the latest security patches and updates. Be sure to select the Update and Restart Option if possible. • Do not Open Suspicious Attachments or Click Suspicious Links. Attacks come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and if someone you know falls victim to an attack, the malware may use their computer and email address book to send you a malicious file or link. Often, people think they are receiving an email from a friend or relative, and their computers get infected. • Change Your Passwords. If you have been using the same password for years, its time for an update. Strong passwords use a mix of capital and lowercase letters with numbers and symbols thrown in. Never use a single word as your password. • Use Reputable Antivirus Programs. While no security software can absolutely prevent all attacks on its own, there are reputable free and paid software programs out there that can help you, and there are some that may make problems worse. Do your research and use a program that will help you. PC Magazine offers advice on the best free and paid antivirus programs, and the well-regarded tech news source Toms Guide offers its own advice. Got Popups? Learn the Keyboard Shortcut. Malicious software often makes its way onto a computer when a user clicks on a popup window. These windows are often designed to be difficult to close or to trick you into clicking the wrong place. The solution is not to click anywhere. If you have a popup, hold the ALT key and press F4 on your computer keyboard to close the active window. Repeat as necessary. The current strain of malware attacks is so vicious that Microsoft has even released updates for older versions of the Windows operating system, including Windows XP, which it stopped issuing updates for in 2014. For more information on older versions of Windows, click here. If you become infected, the police departments do not recommend that you pay the criminals responsible for the cyber attack. Instead, download the correct patch or contact a reputable information technology provider for assistance. Information provided by John Guilfoil Public Relations.",0
130,"NEW HAVEN, CT- A New Haven woman was held against her will and assaulted in her own apartment after her ex-boyfriend with a lengthy criminal history allegedly broke in March 20, according to police. Police began investigating after a man reported to police that his daughter was being held hostage at her apartment in the 1500 block of State Street around 5:06 p.m. Officers arrived at the apartment and spoke with the 26-year-old victim. She said her ex-boyfriend William BJ Brown, 29, of Winchester Avenue held her hostage from 11:30 p.m. on March 19 until noon on March 20, said Officer David Hartman, police spokesman. She returned home March 19 and found the dead bolt to her front door was locked. She didnt have the key so she climbed through a window and spotted Brow in her sons bedroom. She said he appeared intoxicated and agitated and forced her to lie on the kitchen floor, Hartman said. He pinned her down while holding a knife in one hand. She said she was on the floor for about four hours and eventually Brown let her sit on a couch. Brown became agitated and allegedly struck the victim in the face several times after she received a call from her childs father. He stopped the assault when she kicked him in the stomach, Hartman said. Brown took her phone and spoke with the father of her child, but he wasnt making much sense, Hartman said. She got the phone back and sent him a text that said help. Around 7 a.m. Brown apologized to her and around 11:50 a.m. there was a knock at the apartment door. Brown ran to a bedroom to hide while the victim ran outside to her childs father. He drove her to West Haven. Police found the apartment in shambles and EMTs attended to the victims injuries, which included many bruises. Police helped the victim form a safety plan which included not to stay at home until Brown was captured, Hartman said. Brown called police around 7:30 p.m. and said he wanted to report that the victim was harassing him, Hartman said. A dispatcher told him to stay at his location on Winchester Avenue and officers would be there shortly to take his complaint. Police arrived and took Brown into custody. Brown, who has been arrested 28 times was charged with home invasion, unlawful restraint, reckless endangerment, second-degree threatening, third-degree assault and second-degree criminal mischief.",0

132,"An Aguanga man was sentenced this week to life in prison without the possibility of parole after his recent conviction in a disturbing kidnapping and assault case. The man, Randy John Morasch, not only kidnapped and raped two teen boys, but he also tried to have them intimidated or killed after his arrest, according to prosecutors. Morasch, 55, was convicted by a Murrieta jury on Dec. 7 of 22 felony counts including kidnapping, solicitation of murder, sodomy by force or fear, oral copulation by force or fear, dissuading a victim or witness, and assault with a gun. On Thursday, he was sentenced to 64 years in prison, plus 360 years in prison, and life in prison without the possibility of parole for his offenses. The man was first arrested back in June 2014 after he fled to Northern California and was arrested in a high-speed chase. After his arrest, and while in custody awaiting trial, Morasch contacted his stepson, Dennis James DJ Harrison, in an attempt to intimidate or kill the two victims, the Riverside County District Attorneys Office said in a news release. Morasch told Harrison that, if the victims recanted or were unable to testify, he would go free. What Morasch didnt realize, though, was that those calls to his stepson were recorded at the jail, the DAs office said. There were also instructions within a detailed letter to his stepson. Morasch told his stepson to poison or watch Breaking Bad to learn how to get rid of the two victims in his case, according to prosecutors. Harrison, now 33, pleaded guilty in July to two counts of dissuading a victim or witness. Hes now serving a 6 year prison sentence of his own. According to Deputy District Attorney Marcus Garrett, the offenses committed by Morasch occurred between 2006 and 2014 and involved a 16-year-old runaway boy identified in court documents only as P.N. and a 17-year-old boy identified as A.B. In the case of P.N., Morasch invited the homeless youth to stay with him at his house, located in the hills around Anza, a dozen miles east of Temecula. Morasch worked to win the boys confidence, allowing him to freely shoot guns, consume alcohol and ride ATVs, Garrett said. After the boy settled into the ex-cons home, Morasch showed him a homemade pornographic movie featuring his then-teenage stepson, Harrison, having sexual intercourse with a teenage girl, Garrett said. While viewing the video, Morasch raped P.N. and forced him to perform oral sex, the prosecutor said. The victim was sexually abused on multiple occasions in the ensuing months, according to the prosecution. The boy made several attempts to get away from Morasch, who told him that he was affiliated with the Hells Angels and ... could have P.N. killed, Garrett wrote in a trial brief. On one occasion, the teen ran out of the house, and Morasch fired a gun to stop the victim, who was not injured, according to the prosecutor. Ultimately, the boy was able to procure help and flee the residence permanently. In 2013, Morasch was introduced to A.B. through a mutual friend and offered to take the runaway into his house and let him stay rent-free, according to the prosecution. The youth was further permitted to use vehicles, guns and drugs to put him at ease -- and keep him under the defendants sway, Garrett wrote. After a few days, Morasch asked the victim to join him in his bedroom to watch porn, and when the teen tried to leave, the defendant grabbed A.B., put handcuffs on his wrists, bent him over the bed and forcibly sodomized him, according to the prosecutor. Morasch began using open threats to make the victim comply with his sexual demands and deter him from leaving the property, Garrett said. These threats included occasions when the defendant pointed a loaded handgun in the direction of the victim and pulled the trigger, the prosecutor said, adding that the boy was not struck by gunfire. A.B. reunited with his family six months later and revealed what had happened to him. Sheriffs investigators were alerted, and just as they prepared to serve an arrest warrant at the Anza property in June 2014, Morasch fled to the Sacramento area, where the high-speed chase occurred prior to his arrest. According to court records, Moraschs prior convictions included assault with a deadly weapon, evading arrest, burglary and receiving stolen property. — City News Service contributed to this report / Booking photo courtesy of the Riverside County Sheriffs Department",1

137,"Jurors today saw a portion of a videotaped interview in which a man accused of murdering a San Marino resident and burying the victims remains in his own backyard 28 years ago described himself as a pacifist who believes in non-violence. Did you kill John and Linda Sohus? NBC reporter Natalie Morales asked during an August 2008 interview with Christian Gerhartsreiter, who also went by the names Clark Rockefeller and Christopher Crowe, among other aliases. My entire life Ive always been a pacifist. I am a Quaker and I believe in non-violence and I can fairly certainly say that I have never hurt anyone, Gerhartsreiter said. The 52-year-old defendant is charged with murder for the February 1985 slaying of John Sohus. The 27-year-old mans remains were found in May 1994 when a hole was being dug for a swimming pool at the back of the property at 1920 Lorain Road, where Gerhartsreiter had lived in a guesthouse for a time. During his opening statement, Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian told the Los Angeles Superior Court jury that John Sohus and his wife, Linda, are dead and accused Gerhartsreiter of faking their disappearance to cover his tracks. Gerhartsreiter is not charged in connection with Lindas disappearance, but the prosecutor contended the German national arranged for postcards to be sent from Paris to the couples family and friends to give the appearance that they were traveling abroad. One of Gerhartsreiters attorneys, Brad Bailey, has suggested that the postcards prove Linda was alive and that she, rather than his client, might be her husbands killer.   Gerhartsreiter sat down for the TV interview following his Aug. 2, 2008, arrest, according to Los Angeles County sheriffs Detective Timothy Miley. In other testimony, Ralph Boynton told jurors that a police detective from Greenwich, Conn., tried unsuccessfully to speak with Gerhartsreiter -- whom he knew as Christopher Crowe -- at the office where both worked for a New York City investment banking firm in November 1988. Gerhartsreiter didnt show up to the office and requested an extended leave of absence, explaining that he had been busy and was worried about his parents because they were in harms way, possibly being kidnapped by foreign entities, the prosecution witness said. He said he had not alerted Gerhartsreiter about the detectives request. Did the defendant after you had contact with Detective (Daniel) Allen ever show up for work again? the prosecutor asked. No, Boynton responded, noting that the job could average $100,000 to $300,000 a year in commission for employees after they got past the probationary period. Allen, now a Greenwich police lieutenant, said he tried to contact Gerhartsreiter after receiving a teletype from the San Marino Police Department to ascertain information about a vehicle connected to the missing couple. The lieutenant said he tracked down a young man who told him that a man he identified as Chris Crowe had offered him the truck but didnt have title to it. Was he able to get title? Balian asked. No, he was not, the lieutenant said, noting that there was a lien on the vehicle. The police lieutenant said he tried to reach Gerhartsreiter at his office and spoke with a woman at another phone number, and asked that Gerhartsreiter contact him. In testimony Wednesday, Gerhartsreiters former fiancee, Mihoko Manabe, told jurors that he changed his appearance and told her he had to go into hiding after the detective tried to reach him. She told jurors that the man she knew then as Christopher Crowe told her the peron who had phoned identifying himself as a police detective wasnt really from the police -- that I should disregard what he said. The prosecution witness testified that Gerhartsreiter described his parents as being in great danger and himself as being in danger, as well. Manabe said Gerhartsreiter encouraged her to go into hiding with him, proposed to her and changed his appearance by growing a mustache and beard and starting to wear contact lenses instead of glasses after a Greenwich, Conn., police detective tried to reach him some time in 1988 at her home in New York City. Manabe said she helped Gerhartsreiter -- who had previously lived in Greenwich -- color his hair and eyebrows blond, and that the two of them always walked on different sides of the street and got their mail from post office boxes. She also said Gerhartsreiter shredded any mail with addresses on it. Well, the situation was very strange, she told the jury, noting later in her testimony that there was a marked difference in Gerhartsreiters behavior after hearing about the phone call from the detective, who called her home twice. Manabe testified that she continued her relationship with Gerhartsreiter until 1994, when she met the man who is now her husband. I didnt want to stay with him any more, she said of Gerhartsreiter. It was not a happy situation for me. It was not a good relationship. The prosecution has pointed to a string of lies by Gerhartsreiter, telling jurors that he posed at times as a member of the wealthy Rockefeller family, a Hollywood producer, British royalty and a USC film professor, lying even to his wife of 12 years. Gerhartsreiters attorney, Bailey, acknowledged that his client had undisputably, undeniably used different names, but said he was hardly the first person in this city to try and reinvent himself. --Terri Vermeulen Keith, City News Service",0
138,"Two Detroit men, who police say attacked women as they rode bicycles along local streets, appeared in Wayne County courts on Thursday, according to the Wayne County prosecutors office.

141,">>News Alerts: Subscribe to a free email newsletter: BETHESDA • ROCKVILLE • SILVER SPRING Another milestone passed this weekend in the ongoing search for two Maryland siblings – six months since they were reported missing by their father – and authorities seem no closer to finding any trace of the children. Catherine Hoggle, the mentally ill Montgomery County mother who wont disclose the whereabouts of her two young children -- Sarah, 4, and Jacob, 2 -- remains in the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center. Hoggle says the children are safe, but has not given any information on their whereabouts. There are two theories on the fate of the children. Troy Turner, Hoggles common-law husband, and Lindsey Hoggle, their grandmother, believe the schizophrenic mother gave the youngsters to someone to care for them. Montgomery County Police say they believe the children are dead, although no bodies have been found. In a recent interview, Turner said Catherine knows that she was wrong to take the children, and he expects no help from her in finding Sarah and Jacob. This was a criminal act not a mental break, Turner told Montgomery Community Media. I talk to her, I know her; and she knows what she was doing was wrong when she took them. She is hiding behind her issues. She has mental health issues, but those issues arent the reason she did this. Doctors did an updated evaluation of Hoggle last week, but her attorney says her status remains unchanged, and she is still not competent to stand trial on misdemeanor charges of child neglect, abduction and hindering a police investigation for her role in the childrens disappearance. A weekend post on the FindSarahFindJacob Facebook page set up by Lindsey Hoggle urges the public to share any tips or sightings they have of the children. This is a highly unusual situation and we only want them home, she posted. An anonymous tip line is available at www.findsarahfindjacob.com, leave them at a fire station, or other safe haven. Troy Turner posted previously on the FindSarahFindJacob Facebook page: We dont ever give up. … Please continue to share broadly. Hope is alive. Tips Dwindle Video from a New Jersey rest stop in December that a woman claimed showed the missing siblings was reviewed by Montgomery County Police, but local investigators say they are convinced the children are dead. Capt. Darren Francke with Montgomery County Police told MyMCMedia last week that few tips are coming in to authorities. He says answers in the case lie with Catherine Hoggle. Our main interest is seeing what is happening with Catherine and her treatment. We believe Catherine is the key to what happened to the children, Francke said. While police have shifted the Hoggle case to a homicide investigation, according to a previous Patch story, Turner and the Hoggle family believe the children are being harbored by someone at Catherine Hoggles request. Turner says if Catherine Hoggle had killed the youngsters, the massive searches in the area would have uncovered their bodies. I cant imagine anywhere where she could have put their bodies where they wouldnt have been found by now, Turner said in December. Donations to the Hoggle fund can be made at the Find Sarah Find Jacob website or by visiting the GoFundMe page set up by Lindsey Hoggle. Timeline of Events On Sept. 7, Catherine Hoggle borrowed her fathers gray 2012 Nissan Rogue SUV and said she was picking up pizza for Jacob. She returned three hours later without the boy or pizza and told her parents she had left Jacob at a playmates house. On Sept. 8, Hoggle left home with Sarah and told Turner she was taking the child to a day-care center. That afternoon when Turner asked about the childrens whereabouts, Hoggle would not tell him where the children were. Both Hoggle and Turner set off for the police station, but stopped at a Chick-Fil-A near the Germantown Transit Center where Hoggle left the restaurant without Turner noticing and disappeared. On Sept. 12, Hoggle was found and arrested in Germantown. On Nov. 6, it was revealed in court that Hoggle allegedly told her mother she could take the police to where the children are. Hoggles lawyer said she did not want to go, and Judge Eugene Wolfe refused to sign an emergency order for her to leave Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center. On Nov. 17, a psychiatric evaluation of Catherine Hoggle was submitted by Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center, finding her not competent to stand trial. Related Stories",0

143,"A serial rapist has been sentenced to up to 35 years in prison after a jury convicted him of sexually assaulting a woman less than a year after his release from prison on a similar conviction, Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said Tuesday. A Suffolk Superior Court Jury on Friday found Eduardo Rodriguez, 32, of Boston guilty of two counts of aggravated rape and single counts of kidnapping, unarmed robbery, and indecent assault and battery in connection with the Aug. 22, 2016, assault. At approximately 12:30 a.m. on Aug. 22, 2016, Rodriguez was riding a BMX bicycle as he approached a woman walking in the area of Greenwich Park and Claremont Street. Rodriguez threatened the woman with a knife and forced her to walk with him to Carter Playground. There, he sexually assaulted and robbed her of her phone and about $250.The woman was treated at Brigham and Womens Hospital and underwent a sexual assault examination.Boston Police detectives linked Rodriguez to the attack through the GPS monitoring device he was ordered to wear as a condition of his probation for his earlier conviction. Those GPS records placed him at Carter Playground at the time of the assault and showed his movements to and from the location – including a stop in an alley where police later found the clothing Rodriguez had worn at the time of the assault. Security cameras along his path also captured him riding a bicycle and then walking with the victim in the direction of the playground. The victim positively identified Rodriguez in a photo array as the man who attacked her, and relatives of Rodriguez identified the bicycle he was observed riding as one he borrowed from a family member that day. Rodriguez jury trial was followed by a one-day bench trial held yesterday, during which Judge Maureen Hogan found Rodriguez guilty of aggravated rape as a subsequent offense. That finding – based on Rodriguez Suffolk Superior Court rape conviction for a 2007 assault – exposed Rodriguez to an enhanced sentence. Neither of these proceedings was related to a third attack for which Rodriguez faces trial later this year. In that case, he allegedly assaulted a different woman just hours after his attack on the first victim. At Rodriguez sentencing Tuesday morning, Assistant District Attorneys Amy Martin and Elizabeth Riley of the DAs Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Unit recommended that Rodriguez be sentenced to life in prison. Hogan instead sentenced Rodriguez to 30 to 35 years in state prison to be followed by 10 years of probation, during which time he will be required to stay away from and have no contact with the victim, wear a GPS monitor, refrain from using drugs or alcohol, undergo sex offender treatment, and register as a sex offender. Prosecutors and police detectives worked around the clock at times to build this case, Conley said. But it was the survivors testimony that allowed us to hold the defendant accountable. Boston is a safer place with this man behind bars for three decades. Rodriguez was sentenced to an 8- to 10-year prison term for his earlier conviction and was on probation at the time of the 2016 offenses. Prosecutors had recommended a term of 12 to 15 years. He is currently serving an additional three to five years in state prison after a Superior Court judge last year found that he had violated the conditions of that probation with his most recent arrest. The sentence imposed Tuesday will begin once Rodriguez current term of incarceration is complete. Sexual assault can happen to anyone. While the victims of any crime are asked to call 911 in an emergency, survivors of sexual violence can also call their local rape crisis center for free and confidential services and to discuss their options. Support is available for all survivors of sexual violence, regardless of whether they wish to take part in a criminal prosecution. Services by city and town can be found at www.janedoe.org/find_help/search. In Suffolk County, the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center offers a free and confidential 24-hour hotline at 800-841-8371.

144,"The man who was arrested after a 4-hour standoff with Mentor Police Sunday night had a sizable arsenal of guns in his home, including a semiautomatic rifle and a 100-round drum magazine, Mentor Police Lt. Tom Powers said. Ronald Ewanek, 54, of Mentor, will be arraigned this morning in Mentor Municipal Court. He faces charges of inducing panic, obstructing official business, unlawful possession of a dangerous ordnance, use of a weapon while intoxicated and discharging a firearm in the city. After police searched Ewaneks house they found a Feg 7.62 assault rifle, Feg 9-millimeter handgun, Ruger .22 long rifle, Ruger Mini-14 semiautomatic rifle and Foremost 3-06 rifle, Powers said. Ewanek also owned ammunition for all of these weapons, including a 100-round drum magazine for the assault rifle, Powers said. Police were called at about 9 p.m. Sunday to Ewaneks house on Eastmoor Road after neighbors reported hearing three gunshots, Powers said. Officers knew the home belonged to Ewanek, who had been charged with but not convicted of domestic violence in 2011. Police also knew Ewanek had firearms. Mentor Police tried to make contact with the people inside but were not successful. Early on in the standoff, three people -- two women and a man -- were allowed to leave the house. None of them were injured by the shots that were fired. We dont believe (Ewanek) was shooting at anybody, Powers said. Police are still not certain where the shots were fired or what the shooter, who is thought to be Ewanek, was aiming at. Thus far, police have only found one shell casing and it was in the driveway, Powers said. Ewanek remained in the house by himself during the duration of the standoff. He refused to come out so Mentor SWAT and the departments hostage negotiators came to the scene. For several hours, Ewanek refused to take phone calls or negotiate via the loud speaker, police said. After more than four hours of waiting and several attempts to talk to Ewanek failed, the SWAT team used tear gas to flush Ewanek from the house, Powers  said. Ewanek then surrendered and was arrested.",0

Jason Teague has been released from the hospital after suffering a gunshot wound to his left forearm. The wound came in a gunfire exchange with Lauren Brown, who held five Gwinnett firefighters hostage for several hours after a 911 call that was a hoax. Teague also was involved in the 2005 Brian Nichols slaying saga that began in a courthouse in Atlanta, according to a Gwinnett Police news release.

147,"Area Patch sites provided the following reports. In all incidents where an arrest occurred, a charge is merely an accusation and not evidence of guilt. Brighton Patch Howell resident Ben Cameron, 30, was arrested and arraigned on charges of aggravated assault, possession of a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent and driving on a suspended license after cutting a womans hand with a machete early Friday morning. Livingston County Sheriff Bob Bezotte said that Cameron had been in an altercation with another man at Burroughs Tavern in Brighton and was told to leave by owner Joe Agius. Bezotte said Cameron left, but then returned about 15 to 20 minutes later carrying a machete. The woman, another patron, was injured when she grabbed Cameron to stop him from searching for the other man. Bezotte said the woman was treated and released at the scene. Contrary to other reports, Aguis told Brighton Patch that the man did not swing the machete at the woman, and that she cut herself reaching for Cameron. This girl who was a patron, and a friend of his I believe, came up around me and went to grab him, and she grabbed the knife, Agius said. He never swung at her at all. She was grabbing at the knife and grabbing him and he was kind of pulling back. Once she started crying and fell to the ground, he fled instantly. Agius also said that the woman was a patron, not one of his employees. No employees at Burroughs Tavern are allowed to get in the middle of any kind of altercation. We have a couple of big boys on staff that are paid as bouncers, but even they are only allowed to verbally de-escalate situations. If it got to the point where someone is unreasonable about leaving, we dial 911. On a situation like that, Im the one who grabbed the guy and moved him outside. I could have easily got cut. It was crazy. Ive never seen anything like that. Who comes into a place with a machete? According to Bezotte, the fight started because Cameron was hitting on the other mans ex-wife. Hartland Patch A new job at an online company for a laid-off 50-year-old Hartland man turned out to be an identity theft scam, according to a police report. Police said a 73-year-old Hartland woman reported that her Sears Master Card had an unauthorized charge at a popular retail website. The woman told police that her address was used as the billing address, but the shipping address was a home on Austin Court in Hartland. At the other home, the man told police he recently began working for an online company as a project coordinator. His job was to receive shipments from FedEx, photograph the contents, then repackage the shipments and ship them through the U.S. Postal Service in order to save the company on U.S. Customs fees, the report said. The man told police that he had only received and shipped two packages for the company, and that both were sent to Moscow, Russia. According to the report, the man became suspicious when he did not get paid through PayPal as he was supposed to, and filed a complaint with the Michigan Attorney Generals Office. Novi Patch An employee of a retail store at Twelve Oaks Mall contacted police Feb. 25 after receiving harassing calls from someone identifying himself as a police officer. According to the Novi police report, the woman told police that she filed a report on Jan. 28 about the harassing calls, but they continued. Among the latest calls was one to a loss prevention employee at the store in which the woman works, the report indicated. The caller, who identifies himself as Officer White, asked the loss prevention employee for the womans social security number and when the employee refused, the caller threatened to kidnap the woman. The report indicated the calls came from a phone number in Franklin, MS, and that similar incidents have happened to other employees at the same store.",0

The series of terrifying events began on May 2, 2011 inside the Grand Cirque Drive apartment of a Roswell couple. Grogan, who was an acquaintance of the male victims brother, knocked on the apartment door under the pretense of visiting his friend. Once inside, Grogan drew a weapon on the victim and his girlfriend and demanded dope. Grogan then struck the male victim in the face with the gun and robbed him of several hundred dollars.

153,"Detectives are following up today on a lead in Sierra County of a possible sighting in a suspected parental abduction case of a mother and her baby boy missing from Sonoma County, according to authorities. An Amber Alert was issued Monday by the California Highway Patrol for 7-month-old Henry Massey, reportedly snatched Sunday from his crib at his grandmothers Guerneville house by his mother, Hannah Ruth Ashley, 35. The grandmother, the childs legal custodian, called authorities Sunday morning at 8:30 a.m. reporting the baby was missing from his bed and that she believed her daughter, Ashley, was involved, Sonoma County Sheriffs Office deputies said. Sheriffs Sgt. Spencer Crum said today that the Sierra County tip came in Monday at about 7:30 p.m. from a citizen and is considered credible, but did not have specifics on the callers information or the involved town. Little Henry was transferred by Child Protective Services to his grandmothers care as Ashley has a purported history of drug and substance abuse and mental health issues, said Crum, although he could not provide details if the custodial transfer was at the boys birth or after a reported incident. Sheriffs officials said on Monday, in a be on the lookout alert, that the boy was not believed to be in danger, and there was never a threat of violence toward the infant. There has never been a threat of violence towards the child, and the child is not believed to be in danger, however the grandmother has legal custody, the agency said. During recent child visitations, it was reported that Ashley made threats to take her child back. The CHP described Henry as white male, who is 26 inches tall and 15 pounds with brown hair and gray eyes. Ashley is 5 feet 6 inches tall, weighs 125 pounds and has brown hair and brown eyes. CHP Officer Juan Leon said the sheriffs office requested an Amber Alert on Monday to broaden the search for Ashley and the infant after investigators exhausted search efforts in the Guerneville and Sonoma County area. A parent who abducts a child often goes to a relative or stays in the local area, Leon said, however, Crum noted he did not know what Ashleys connection might be to Sierra County, which borders Nevada. Ashley is reportedly driving a silver Subaru Forester with California license plate No. 5JKZ255, and anyone who spots her or the vehicle is asked to call 911 or Sonoma County Sheriffs Dispatch at 707-565-2121.

162,"A suspected bank robber, who was reportedly wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet, was shot to death by police after a wild chase across Miami-Dade County that included two armed carjackings and a police standoff t on live television. Officers with guns drawn surrounded 52-year-old Ernesto Padron as he bobbed up and down in the murky Miami River. Police then opened fired when Padron refused to surrender and instead produced a handgun, according to the official account. We began to pull back our uniformed personnel and bring some tactical personnel in to include our hostage negotiators, Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez told reporters on the scene. The incident occurred near Marlins Park and involved multiple law enforcement agencies, including the Miami-Dade Police Department, FBI, Miami Police Department and Hialeah Police Department. Detective Alvaro Zabaleta of the Miami-Dade Police Department said that officers opened fire when Padron pulled out a handgun. The standoff took place at NW 27 Ave between 17 Street and 20 Street. Police closed the 27th Avenue Bridge for a time and asked motorists to avoid the area, which is not far from Marlins Park. Hostage negotiators maintained an open line of communication with the subject in attempts to convince him to surrender, Zabaleta said. The subject then began to submerge himself several times, produced a firearm, and shots were fired. Padron was pronounced dead by Miami-Dade Fire Rescue at the scene. No officers were injured. Detective Robin Pinkard of the Miami-Dade Police Department confirmed to Patch that Padron was shot by Miami-Dade officers but she could not say where he was shot or how many times. Local 10 News reported that a total of nine officers opened fire. Pinkard said that the initial call came in from the FBI, which was attempting to arrest Padron around 7:30 a.m. The initial location for the call was listed as 20th Street and NW 27th Avenue in Hialeah. Police said that Padron escaped on foot when FBI agents showed up to take him into custody for the bank robbery. Padron could be seen on helicopter news video eluding police in a brown BMW SUV that was taken during the first carjacking at a Hialeah gas station. A police pursuit ensued and the subject drove to the city of Miami, where he committed a second armed carjacking, according to Zabaleta, who identified the second vehicle as a black Mazda SUV.

Video shot from Local 10s news helicopter showed Padron abandoning the stolen BMW SUV and pointing a gun at the driver of the Mazda who was stopped in traffic on her way to work. Get the F out of the car right now or I will shoot you, the woman, identified as Minerva Castellano recalled Padron saying to her in an interview with Local 10 News. I wasnt really scared at the moment because Im thinking its an undercover cop because I had seen cops all over the place. I thought he was an undercover cop that needed my car.  Local 10 News also reported that the FBI wanted Padron in connection with a Sept. 29 bank robbery. An audio recording of the police dispatch call said that Padron had been wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet at the time he was shot.

163,"The FBI today accused North Korea of being behind the cyberattack that prompted Sony Pictures to cancel the release of The Interview, a development raising fears among entertainers that the free speech rights of Americans are threatened. As a result of our investigation, and in close cooperation with other U.S. government departments and agencies, the FBI now has enough information to conclude that the North Korean government is responsible for these actions, according to an FBI statement. Before the statement was issued, actor George Clooney said he and his agent circulated a petition in support of Sony after it became the victim of a the cyberattack and before it cancelled the Christmas Day release of The Interview, but none of the many entertainment figures who were asked to sign it agreed to do so. The thrust of the petition circulated by Clooney and his agent, Bryan Lourd, was were not going to give in to a ransom, Clooney said. He further accused the press of abdicating its responsibility to focusing on salacious Sony email links rather than investigating the hackers. A good portion of the press abdicated its real duty. They played the fiddle while Rome burned, he told Deadline Hollywood. There was a real story going on. With just a little bit of work, you could have found out that it wasnt just probably North Korea; it was North Korea, he said. The FBI, in effectively confirming Clooneys assertion, said it found telltale signs in the cyberattack. The FBI has determined that the intrusion into (Sony Pictures Entertainments) network consisted of the deployment of destructive malware and the theft of proprietary information, as well as employees personally identifiable information and confidential communications ... the FBI statement said.

167,"The family of Korryn Gaines met with the Baltimore County states attorney Wednesday afternoon to review whether charges would be filed in the case of the officer who fatally shot the 23-year-old woman in her apartment. States Attorney Scott Shellenberger said that the officer was justified in the shooting. Gaines, of the unit block of Sulky Court in Randallstown, barricaded herself inside her residence when officers showed up around 9:01 a.m on Aug. 1 to serve her with an arrest warrant for failing to appear about a traffic violation, Shellenberger said. She would not open the door, which officers tried to open with a key, according to the report provided by Shellenberger (see the report below); there was a latch inside the door she would not undo. When officers kicked in the door, her fiance, who was also being served with an arrest warrant for assaulting her, came out of the apartment with his 1-year-old daughter and told police that Gaines was mentally ill and had not been taking her medication, the report said. He tried to get his and Gaines 5-year-old son to come with him out of the apartment, but the boy, Kodi, ran back to his mother, officials said. Meanwhile, Gaines was sitting on the floor of the apartment pointing a shotgun at the officers, who began to treat the situation as a barricade and called in support teams including the hostage negotiation and tactical units. The hostage negotiators asked that she send Kodi out, and she refused, according to the report, which said family members also attempted to communicate with her voicing the same request. Gaines said she would come out before 10:30 a.m. if the police put their guns down and backed up from her apartment, according to an account her neighbor provided through her attorneys. When police did not retreat, she told them to leave. Over the course of several hours, ...there were times when Ms. Gaines spoke calmly and others where she screamed and acted irrationally. She stated that the police were the devils, that they were crazy, that she had been unjustly kidnapped by the police, that the government had kidnapped her fiance, that the police were only at her apartment because she was black, that when she and her son were dead the news would report it and the world would know, and it would be worth it as [long as] she took at least one of the officers with her, that she was absolutely not coming out... Shellenberger wrote. The deadly confrontation ended at 3:24 p.m. after police said Gaines pointed a shotgun at a tactical officer and threatened to shoot him. Authorities said there was an exchange of gunfire; Gaines fired two rounds from the shotgun, but did not strike police. Officer Ruby shot her, officials said. Based on a union agreement, police in Baltimore County are identified by last name only. The family of Gaines is suing the Baltimore County Police Department and Ruby for $2 million each, claiming excessive force, gross negligence, wrongful death and suppression of speech. The family was expected to provide a statement Wednesday afternoon. Officials said that Ruby, who has served the Baltimore County Police Department for 16 years, was involved in one prior police-involved shooting in August 2007. That incident was also fatal, according to The Baltimore Sun, which reported Ruby and another officer shot at a 24-year-old suicidal man in Parkville who threatened to shoot them with a weapon that later turned out to be a BB gun. Regarding the shooting of Gaines on Aug. 1 in Randallstown, Shellenberger concluded: Criminal charges are not warranted. Photo via Shutterstock",0

172,"In April, Framingham Police, swarmed a Frost Street home around 8 a.m., thinking an armed gunman was inside. Framingham Police had received a 9-1-1 call from a man, calling himself Peter. The caller said he had shot his girlfriend and taken other family members hostage. But inside was Irandi Waighe and her mother-in-law, 96, who is a double amputee and in a wheelchair. The unsuspecting family and Framingham Police were the victims of a swatting hoax. Yesterday, at the Framingham Police Station Congresswoman Katherine Clark with Framingham Police Chief Ken Ferguson, unveiled a national bill to help battle these swatting hoaxes. It is far more than a hoax, Rep. Clark said. It is really such a dangerous situation for law enforcement, for victims, and for communities at large. The FBI estimates 400 swatting attacks occur every year. Swatting is defined as the intentional misleading of emergency responders in order to provoke a S.W.A.T. team response. Some swatting incidents have been reported to cost local law enforcement agencies as much as $100,000. Ferguson said he did not know how much two incidents in Framingham in April cost the Town. The most serious cost of these attacks is the danger they pose to emergency responders, innocent victims, and their families, said Clark. Swatting attacks, nationwide, have resulted in injury to law enforcement officers, heart attacks, and serious injury to victims. Congresswoman Clark said across the country there have been cases where young children are at home, during a swatting hoax. Perpetrators of these hoaxes purposefully use our emergency responders to harm their victims, said Clark. These false reports are dangerous and costly, and have resulted in serious injury to victims and law enforcement. It is time to update our laws to appropriately address this crime. In Framingham, there have been two calls this year, both in April. During the second call in Framingham, a Nicholas Road resident, with a heart condition, was inside when Police arrived. Police however were told via a 9-1-1 call that a man named John plan to attack Framingham Police and had a weapon. While federal law prohibits using the telecommunications system to falsely report a bomb threat hoax or a terrorist attack, falsely reporting other emergency situations is not currently prohibited. The Interstate Swatting Hoax Act proposed would close this loophole by prohibiting the use of the interstate telecommunications system to knowingly transmit false information with the intent to cause an emergency law enforcement response. Individuals convicted could face up to 20 years in prison. Having a national law will help reduce these type of calls, said Chief Ferguson. Chief Ferguson said when his department receives a call they have to treat it like it is real each time. Each time we take a call, we plan for the worst and hope for the best, said the police chief. But it is dangerous for everybody, said Chief Ferguson. It is dangerous for the police officers responding. Its dangerous for the community ... its dangerous for the people (at the home) we are responding to. No arrests have been made in either Framingham 2015 swatting incident.",1

The victim drove briefly on Pierce Street, then the two threatened and robbed him, a police affidavit said. The victim told police the two robbers demanded his wallet and then became angry because he only had $20. They forced him to drive onto a side street where they made him get out of the car and patted him down for more valuables. Then the older robber, identified as Smith, allegedly fired three shots at a close range with a black and grey handgun. One shot hit the driver in the back. The two stole his phone and ran away. A witness saw the two arrive in a white sedan at the 7-Eleven and enter the Lincoln. The witness told police that the two were seen soon afterwards running back to the gas station and driving off in the white sedan. In spite of his injuries, the victim drove back to the 7-Eleven and asked the clerk to call 911. He was taken to St. Anthony Hospital for treatment of his wounds. Investigators tied the crime to the armed robbery and carjacking of a Lyft driver in Denver an hour earlier. A man told police he was parked in the 1400 block of Glenarm Place when two males approached him and one held a silver handgun to his face and demanded he get out of the drivers seat. The driver told police the two males drove him around in his white 2014 Honda Accord demanding he go to a bank and withdraw money. He told them he didnt have any money and they took his cell phone and car and left, the affidavit said. An abandoned white Honda was found near the 7-Eleven gas station with the drivers stolen phone found in a trash can nearby. Police said they found a stack of $20 bills in the Honda. Fingerprints from the Honda and Lincoln were matched with Smith, the police affidavit said. He has a history of multiple criminal convictions including burglary, identity theft, robbery, theft and assault, the police affidavit said. Smith was taken into custody by Denver police on July 3. He is being held in Denver County Jail on a $100,000 bond. Smith was charged with multiple felonies including attempted murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery. He is next scheduled to appear in court Aug. 14. The 13-year-old was charged in the juvenile court.

176,"Kyle police are warning residents of an ongoing scam in which the scammers try to convince their victim that theyve failed to report for jury duty. Cynthia Watts, who lives in a senior-living complex on $750 monthly disability payments, was called by a man claiming to be with the Hays County Sheriffs Office. He demanded she pay $500 in pre-paid gift cards in order to keep out of jail. The phone number even appeared to be from a city or county government office. I couldnt believe it. My blood pressure went up. I started shaking. There were people there watching me. I was scared. I didnt know what to do, Watts said, according to KVUE. The caller said she had an arrest warrant for missing jury duty. Last year, Watts said she had missed a jury duty because of a death in the family, KVUE reported, so she thought they were referring to that event. Her options, according to the scammer, were to pay $500 in pre-paid gift cards or go to jail for four weeks. Acting aggressively, they stayed on the phone with Watts while she went around her complex and asked her neighbors. Watts eventually ended up able to pay the scammers with help from her neighbors in her complex. She sent the money on two separate days, and when she did, she was told to go to the Sheriffs Office to pick up her paperwork. Thats when the actual sheriffs told her she had been scammed. People tell me, Well, at least you didnt get hurt. It hurt my heart, it hurt my feelings, it hurt my pocketbook for sure, said Watts, KVUE reported. I dont know how people can do this. I know people are on hard times right now, but scamming poor people for money right at Christmastime, I wouldnt be able to sleep at night knowing I could do that to somebody like that, she said. A similar scam took place in Hays County earlier this year, according to KVUE. Another similar scam happened in Elgin, Ill., in which an 18-year-old woman was called saying she would go to jail for missing jury duty if she didnt pay in pre-paid gift cards. While the scammers had her on the phone going all over the place, they called her mother from her number (but not her phone) saying she had been kidnapped and demanded ransom. Police do not demand money over the phone. Article image via Shutterstock",0
177,"A 21-year-old Richmond man was sentenced Friday to 21 years to life in state prison for killing a 72-year-old woman during an attempted kidnapping in Berkeley in 2014. Kamau Berlin pleaded no contest in December to second-degree murder and attempted carjacking for fatally stabbing Emeryville resident Nancy Jo McClellan. Prosecutors said Berlin, who was only 18 at the time and attended a Berkeley high school, attacked Nancy Jo McClellan in the vicinity of Russell and Otis streets in Berkeley at about 4:30 p.m. on Sept. 19, 2014. McClellan, who had been attending a wedding at the nearby Berkeley Zen Center, didnt die immediately after she was stabbed but never regained consciousness and died on Oct. 8, 2014. Berkeley police Sgt. Peter Hong testified at Berlins preliminary hearing last year that Berlin admitted that he stabbed McClellan and inflicted wounds that led to her death, saying that Berlins admission came when he and another officer left Berlin alone in a police car with a hidden tape recorder running. Hong said Berlin, who had previously invoked his right to have an attorney when officers tried to question him, was thinking out loud and verbalizing his thoughts in his comments on the tape recording. Hong said Berlin said he didnt want to go to jail for life and admitted to killing the lady, that he murdered and stabbed the old lady. Hong said he ordered that a sexual assault examination be performed on McClellan because her undergarments had been pulled down. But Alameda County Superior Court Judge Rhonda Burgess ruled at the end of Berlins preliminary hearing that there wasnt enough evidence to order him to stand trial on an attempted rape charge and the special circumstance of committing a murder during an attempted rape. — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock Also See:",0
178,"A state-led undercover sting targeting rogue companies caught 29 predatory movers, 20 of whom are from New Jersey, according to the Office of Attorney General. The sting operation occurred over the course of four days in April 2018. Investigators from Office of Consumer Protection posed as individuals planning to move from an upscale neighborhood in Montville, according to an OAG release. Operation Mothers Attic is a proactive effort to identify and weed out movers doing business outside the Divisions oversight, said Paul R. Rodríguez, acting director of the Division of Consumer Affairs. By requiring movers to abide by our states public movers licensing laws, we are protecting consumers against fraud and other risks. The investigators found various unlicensed moving companies advertising online and hired them for their move, according to the release. The movers drove to Montville, expecting to find a luxury home full of items to load, and were instead met by a team of investigators, according to the release. Also awaiting the movers were members of the State Polices Mobile Safety Freight Unit, who conducted vehicle safety inspections on their trucks, and members of the U.S. Department of Transportations Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, according to the release. One out-of-state moving company cited in the last Operation Mothers Attic sting in 2016 was among the unlicensed movers caught this year. Go To Moving & Storage of Staten Island was cited as a second-time offender and assessed an enhanced civil penalty of $5,000. An unlicensed moving company can be a homeowners worst nightmare, said Attorney General Grewal. Theyve been known to hold truckloads of property hostage until the customer pays an extortionate fee. And these unlicensed movers often dont carry adequate insurance, creating the risk that homeowners will be left high and dry if their property is seriously damaged during the move. Thats why we regulate the industry – and why we crack down on rogue operators. State law requires all intrastate movers – those performing residential moves that both begin and end in New Jersey – to be licensed by the Division of Consumer Affairs and to observe the statutes and regulations concerning the storage and transportation of household goods. Read more: Other public movers cited for operating without a license are: Each mover has the option of seeking mitigation or requesting an administrative hearing to contest the violation and civil penalty. Call the Division of Consumer Affairs at 973-504-6422 to verify the license status of any mover you consider hiring, and to ask whether consumer complaints have been submitted against the mover. Consumers who believe they have been cheated or scammed by a business, or suspect any other form of consumer abuse, can file a complaint with the State Division of Consumer Affairs by visiting its website or by calling 1-800-242-5846 (toll free within New Jersey) or 973-504-6200.

190,"An ex-Marine and Harvard Law School graduate accused of abducting a Huntington Beach native in March made an initial appearance in federal court in Sacramento Monday on a kidnapping charge. The hearing follows a claim filed by his alleged victim accusing police of failing to take her abduction seriously while publicly dismissing it as a hoax inspired by the film Gone Girl. According to The Orange County Register, Denise Huskins alleges she was sexually assaulted repeatedly while police failed to follow up on leads. Matthew Muller, 38, of Orangevale in Sacramento County, is accused of breaking into a Mare Island home shared by Huskins and Aaron Quinn at 3 a.m. on March 23, drugging them, tying their hands with zip ties, masking their eyes with swim goggles, and abducting Hoskins in the trunk of a car. Huskins was dropped off near her mothers house in Huntington Beach two days later. Vallejo police initially said they believed Huskins and Quinns account of the kidnapping was a hoax and that the couple had led police on a wild goose chase. Police Chief Andrew Bidou sent them a letter of apology in July, the couples lawyers said last week. Still, Huskins and Quinn on Thursday filed a claim of reputation damage and emotional distress against the Vallejo Police Department, in a possible precursor to a lawsuit. On Monday, Muller was informed of the charge against him but did not enter a plea at the hearing before federal magistrate Allison Claire, according to Lauren Horwood, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorneys Office in Sacramento. Mullers next hearing will be before U.S. Magistrate Kendall Newman on Oct. 5 for either arraignment on a grand jury indictment, if one is issued, or a preliminary hearing, Horwood said. Mullers defense attorney, Thomas Johnson, said he expected federal prosecutors to seek an indictment. Johnson said, I dont anticipate a plea bargain in the federal case. At the Oct. 5 hearing, the magistrate will also consider a defense request that Muller should not be required to wear hand as well as ankle shackles when in court, according to the case docket. He wore full shackles at Mondays hearing, according to the docket. Muller is currently charged in a federal criminal complaint filed on June 29 with one count of kidnapping. On Friday, Muller pleaded no contest to charges of attempted robbery, burglary and assault with a deadly weapon in a similar home invasion of a Dublin residence early in the morning on June 5. According to an FBI affidavit filed with the federal complaint, Muller entered the house at about 3:30 a.m. and was in the process of tying up the homeowners with zip ties when the husband fought back and the wife escaped to a locked bathroom and called 911 on her cellphone. The intruder fled, but left behind a cellphone that eventually led investigators to Muller and to evidence allegedly linking him to the Vallejo kidnapping. Johnson said Muller served in the Marines for three years between 1995 and 1998 before attending college. Muller graduated from Pomona College and Harvard Law School. He worked for a time as an immigration attorney but was suspended by the State Bar of California in 2013 and disbarred earlier this year. Bay City News",1

192,"A young man accused of grabbing a little girl at a Solana Beach school, wrapping packing tape around her face and trying to take her into his van was free on $2.5 million bail Saturday, officials said. He must wear a GPS anklet and be taken to an in-patient mental health facility, according to the judges orders. RELATED: Jack Henry Doshay -- his parents are well-known philanthropists and his dad, Glenn, was a minority owner of the San Diego Padres -- just had bail granted to him Thursday. A clerk at the San Diego County jail could not say whether his family paid cash or if there was some bond posted. According to NBC7 San Diego News, Doshay was driven away in a private vehicle, ducking in the back seat. Vista Superior Court Judge William Gentry said earlier this week that if Doshay posts the bail, he must be taken immediately to an in-patient psychological facility, wear a GPS anklet 24 hours a day, surrender his passport and refrain from driving. Jack Henry Doshay, 22, of Fairbanks Ranch, had been held without bail since his arrest April 1 in the alleged abduction attempt a week earlier. Prosecutors asked that Doshay be held on $25 million bail. According to NBCSanDiego.com, DNA found on the packing tape matches that of the defendant. On the afternoon of March 23, Doshay allegedly grabbed the girl at Skyline Elementary School, clapped a hand over her mouth, tried to put packing tape onto her face and ordered her to get into his silver-and-black SUV. When she struggled and fought back, the would-be abductor let her go, returned to his vehicle and drove off, authorities said. Detectives followed up on about 150 tips in the case before tracking down the suspect in Orange County with information provided by his attorney, Paul Pfingst. Doshay pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of kidnapping, false imprisonment and child cruelty. He faces 11 years in prison if convicted. An affidavit in support of an arrest warrant states that Doshays father Glenn -- a minority owner of the San Diego Padres -- told his sons therapist two days after the alleged abduction attempt that he suspected his son was involved. A readiness conference was set for May 6 and a preliminary hearing for May 28.",1

200,"- The man who killed the manager of a Trader Joes in Silverlake, and held a store full of terrified customers and employees hostage, was named Sunday by Los Angeles police as Gene Evin Atkins, 28. Family members had told reporters the identity of the man Saturday, but most news agencies waited to confirm it with police. Officer Drake Madison of the LAPDs Media Relations Section released it Sunday. Atkins remained hospitalized Sunday, under guard, and no court appearance has been scheduled. Atkins was booked on a murder charge and was being held in lieu of $2 million bail, LAPD spokesman Officer Drake Madison said. I dont yet know what other charges he will face, Madison said. Melyda Corado, 27, manager of the Silverlake Trader Joes, was identified as by her brother as the woman who was killed. The brother, Albert Corado, first Tweeted during the incident that his sister worked at the Trader Joes and that the family could not contact her. But he later mourned her death online. Im sad to say she didnt make it, he said. My baby sister. My world. The violent episode may have started Friday, when his cousin spotted Atkins sleeping with a gun under his pillow at his grandmothers house, on 32nd Street near Long Beach Avenue, the cousin told City News Service. After shooting his grandmother and his girlfriend at about 1:30 Saturday afternoon, Atkins forced his wounded girlfriend into his grandsmothers car and sped across the Midcity of Los Angeles. Police used a LoJack system and traced the vehicle to the Hollywood area and gave chase, leading to Silver Lake, where the suspect crashed the Toyota into a power pole at 3:30 p.m. in front of the Trader Joes supermarket in the 2700 block of Hyperion Avenue. Atkins emerged with a handgun, shooting at police at least twice, witnesses said. Inside the store, Corado was hit by gunfire, but it was not immediately clear whether the suspect shot the woman, or if she was killed in the crossfire. Los Angeles police Chief Michel Moore said the circumstances of the womans death were still unclear. It was not immediately known where the woman was when she was shot. Employees and customers inside scrambled for cover, they said later. Some were seen escaping through a window toward the rear of the business and crawling down a ladder to safety. Police were seen carrying several children away from the building. Moore later said about 40 people were believed to be in the store when the suspect entered. A short time later, a woman was seen being dragged away from the stores entryway and then being treated by paramedics. Paramedics tried to revive the woman, now identified as Corado, but she was pronounced dead. The suspects girlfriend was taken to a hospital in fair condition. Fire officials described her as a 20-year-old woman. Police amassed outside the store, and at 5:30 p.m., at least three people who appeared to be customers came out of the store with their hands in the air -- apparently hostages who were released or shoppers who had managed to elude the gunman. As the standoff unfolded, the LAPD went on a citywide tactical alert, keeping all available officers on duty beyond their shifts to ensure enough personnel were available to respond to the barricade situation. The suspect ultimately surrendered at 6:30 p.m., walking out of the store with a group of hostages. He held his hands in the air and quickly dropped to his knees as SWAT officers surrounded him and took him into custody. The man was treated for a gunshot injury to his left arm. Margaret Stewart of the Los Angeles Fire Department said paramedics treated 10 people at the scene of the Trader Joes, including the suspect, his girlfriend and the woman who died. A 12-year-old boy, a 41-year-old woman, a 70- year-old woman and an 81-year-old woman were all hospitalized with minor injuries and listed in fair condition, she said. Three other people were evaluated, but declined to be taken to hospitals. After it ended, LAPD Chief Michael Moore said the destructive and tragic consequences one person can inflict are at the forefront of our minds tonight, as is the valor and dedication of our men and women who strived to protect so many innocent people, Moore said. Our thoughts, prayers and hearts are with all affected by this senseless incident. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti added his condolences as well. Our hearts break for the victim killed at the #SilverLake #TraderJoes and their loved ones, Garcetti posted on Twitter. Officials with Trader Joes issued a statement late Saturday praising police and vowing to help its employees heal. Our hearts are broken over what happened today, the statement said. This has been an incredible trauma, and our thoughts are with our Crew Members and customers. Our focus is on doing whatever we can to support them at this time. We appreciate everything Los Angeles law enforcement did to ensure an end to this ordeal. Officers said they are still processing the scene Sunday and that Hyperion Avenue between Griffith Park Boulevard and Ettrick Street would remain closed until at least noon.

An uninvolved motorist stopped to assist the victim who suffered an injury to her shoulder and arm. She alleged the suspect brandished a handgun and demanded sexual favors while threatening to kill her as he drove with her in his vehicle, according to Rojas. Pasadena police detectives discovered the suspect was on parole and had been outfitted with a GPS monitor. The U.S. Marshals Service took McDaniel into custody May 4. Hes being held in lieu of $2 million bail and is due back in a Pasadena courtroom June 28. If convicted of the charges, he could face two life terms in state prison, according to the District Attorneys Office. --City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",1
217,"A call to police that someone was being held hostage in an Annapolis apartment was phony, say Annapolis Police, and the caller has been arrested. Flontina Brown, 33, of Annapolis reported about 11:45 p.m. Thursday that a man was being held at gunpoint inside one of the apartments in the 900 block of President Street, according to police. Officers were unable to contact anyone inside the apartment. The police departments special emergency team and crisis negotiation team responded to the apartment. At that point, Browns story started to change, said authorities. Officers contacted the apartment leaseholder, who responded and let police enter the home. They found no one inside the apartment. Annapolis Police arrested Brown and will be charged with making false statements. She is awaiting her initial hearing before the District Court Commissioner, police said Friday morning.",1
218,"An Oklahoma man accused of holding his stepdaughter captive for nearly two decades and repeatedly raping and torturing her has been arrested, according to the district attorney in the case. Henri Piette, 62, was arrested Thursday in Mexico and returned to Oklahoma Friday. He previously had been charged with first-degree rape and other offenses after the woman, now 33, and her children managed to escape from a tent in rural Mexico and made their way to safety at the U.S. Embassy. The bizarre case began to unfold in June 2016 when Rosalynn McGinnis — who investigators say was 11 when she was kidnapped in 1997 from her school in Poteau, Oklahoma — made her dramatic escape. Piette is accused of grabbing her from the school after the girls mother left him because of assaults, investigators have said. Piette and the womans mother reportedly had been living together at a womens shelter in Porteau when the breakup occurred. Patchs policy is to not name the victims of sexual assault unless they come forward; McGinnis has been speaking publicly about her ordeal. She told People magazine last year that she wanted the world to know about the more than 19 years in which she was raped, beaten with baseball bats, stabbed and choked until she was unconscious, saying that she wanted Piette stopped before he could hurt others and for justice to be served. I knew if I didnt get out of there, Id either go insane or I would end up dying and leaving my kids with that man, she told People in August. (Sign up for newsletters and real-time news alerts from your local Oklahoma Patch. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) After she was kidnapped, McGinnis was introduced to Piettes other children as their new mother, an FBI agent wrote in a court affidavit filed in Wagoner County District Court, The Oklahoman reported. She was married to Piette in a van in Wagoner, Oklahoma, and even given a ring, according to court affidavits. The ceremony was performed by one of Piettes sons, who was 15 at the time, investigators said. The FBI agent wrote that after Piette introduced McGinnis as their new mother, they traveled around the United States, including various locations in Oklahoma, Texas, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico and Arizona, as well as in Mexico. In an attempt to escape detection, Piette changed their names repeatedly, an FBI special agent wrote in the court affidavit. When they were in Oklahoma, the FBI agent said, Piette forced McGinnis to mail letters so people would believe she was still there. According to the court documents, McGinnis was raped multiple times a day almost every day during the nearly two decades. When she escaped, she took eight of her nine children with her. A son who had run away earlier has since been reunited with his mother, according to reports. The children are ages 2 to 17. After she escaped, McGinnis hid out until the U.S. Consulate and National Center for Missing and Exploited Children could make arrangements for her return to the United States. It is believed that Piette has resided in Mexico and or Central America for a very long time and has deep ties to criminal organizations in Mexico, which can assist him in evading law enforcement, according to the FBI affidavit. During the week of September 10th, Piette was contacting persons who aided Rosalynns escape from Mexico and threatening these individuals. After fleeing Piette, McGinnis contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and told them what she had been through. I was still scared, but it was wonderful not to have to lie anymore, McGinnis told People. Since returning to the United States, McGinnis has worked with the JAYC Foundation, an organization founded by Jaycee Dugard, who was 11 when she was kidnapped from South Lake Tahoe, California, while walking to the school bus. She was held for 18 years before she and her two children were rescued. Her foundation helps victims like herself and McGinnis reconnect with their families through an extensive, multi-disciplinary approach. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children Vice President Robert Lowery said McGinnis showed uncommon courage and a lot of bravery. She wasnt only concerned for herself, Lowery said, but for her children. McGinnis told People she is looking forward to piecing her life back together without Piette. My future seems bright — a lot brighter, she said. Life still is hard, but its not near as hard as it ever was with him. Photo via Shutterstock",1
219,"An Evanston man who stole a car from a woman whose 5-year-old son was in the back seat last year has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for vehicular hijacking after pleading guilty to one of the charges levied against him. A judge also sentenced 19-year-old Deangelo Fountain, 19, of the 1300 block of Fowler Avenue, to four years in prison for an unrelated count of residential burglary on Tuesday, according to the Park Ridge Herald-Advocate. He will serve the sentences consecutively. Fountain has admitted to stealing the car. Authorities have said he jumped into a womans 2012 Audi on February 20, 2014 while it was running and she was unloading groceries at her home in Park Ridge and drove off. After realizing a child was in the car, Fountain told authorities he panicked and abandoned it. It was found in six miles away in Skokie soon after an Amber Alert was issued. The boy was unhurt. Fountain was originally charged with aggravated vehicular hijacking, aggravated kidnapping and unlawful possession of a stolen vehicle. As part of a plea agreement, the other charges against him were dropped. more via the Park Ridge Herald-Advocate",1
220,"A Nanuet man who worked as a school security guard in Hastings-on-Hudson was arrested Thursday for a quadruple homicide. The killings were connected to a drug conspiracy, prosecutors allege. According to the indictment, Joseph Biggs was working with Nicholas Tartaglione, the ex-Briarcliff Manor cop accused of the crime in December. Biggs was charged in a 17-count Superseding Indictment, along with Tartaglione, for their participation in a conspiracy to distribute five kilograms and more of cocaine and for the murders of Martin Luna, Urbano Santiago, Miguel Luna, and Hector Gutierrez in furtherance of that conspiracy. The new indictment also includes firearms and kidnapping charges against both men in connection with the murders. As alleged, Joseph Biggs, a school security officer, participated in the brutal drug-related kidnapping and murder of four people in a bar in Chester, New York, Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim said in the announcement. Murders are always frightening, but when allegedly committed by people entrusted with the safety of others, it is all the more disturbing. Some of the victims, police say, were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. According to prosecutors, Tartaglione and Biggs lured Martin Luna to a bar called the Likquid Lounge, where he was held captive and killed. The other three victims – Urbano Santiago, Miguel Luna, and Hector Gutierrez – accompanied Martin Luna to the bar, and they were then held captive, shot, and killed. Biggs, 55, was taken into federal custody this morning. He was presented in White Plains federal court today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Judith McCarthy and ordered detained. His case has been assigned to United States District Judge Kenneth M. Karas. Tartaglione has been in federal custody since his arrest. Kim praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI, the New York State Police, and the Village of Chester Police Department. Mr. Kim also thanked the City of Middletown Police Department for its assistance in the case. Life in prison is the maximum penalty for each of the 17 charges in the indictment. They are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. Tartagliones time as a Briarcliff Manor cop was full of controversy. A confrontation with village gadfly Clay Tiffany at Scarborough Park reverberated for years of lawsuits. He also fought with the village police department over a case which he had manipulated to get a friend of a friend off a DWI charge. He was a plaintiff or a defendant in four suits with the village. Biggs was involved in a milder altercation in 2015, when an argument over a basketball game apparently degenerated into a family feud at a Nanuet fitness center.",1

222,"A man who allegedly kept a University of California at Santa Cruz student against her will in his car early Thursday morning was arrested later that night, campus police said today. Jose Calderon Ortiz, 28, of Watsonville, is believed to be the driver who gave the hitchhiking student a ride from a bus stop at the schools Kresge College at Heller and McLaughlin drives 12:45 a.m. Thursday, police said. Ortiz allegedly didnt pull over when he reached the base of campus at High Street and Bay Drive, where the student wanted to leave, according to police. He headed down Bay Drive for a mile, ignoring the students requests to pull over and stop, according to police. The victim fled from the car as the driver slowed down to turn on Mission Street and didnt stop. The student suffered minor injuries in the escape, according to police. The 28-year-old man was believed to be under the influence and smoking marijuana during the trip, police said. The suspects vehicle was described Thursday as a newer-model, four-door sedan that was dark gray or silver with red paper license plates from a Watsonville car dealership, police said. Investigators received tips that helped them identify Ortiz as the suspect and arrested him around 9 p.m. with help from the Santa Cruz County Anti-Crime Team, according to police. The suspect was pulled over during a traffic stop to check if he was following his probation, according to police. He was arrested and his vehicle was impounded, police said.

224,"A 30-year-old Elgin man who fatally shot a man execution-style before kidnapping his girlfriend and her 1-year-old child has been sentenced to 86 years in prison, prosecutors said. Kane County Judge John A. Barsanti handed down the sentence for Alberto J. Sepeda on Monday. Sepeda was convicted in May of first-degree murder, home invasion and two counts of aggravated kidnapping in connection with the November 2016 fatal shooting of Norbert Gutierrez, 59, of Elgin. Prosecutors said Sepeda forced his way into Gutierrezs home in the 800 block of Morgan Street, where his girlfriend and her infant child were staying, at about 4:15 a.m. on Nov. 16, 2016. He was drunk and when he refused to leave, Gutierrez threw him out of the house, according to the news release. Sepeda, of the 300 block of South Belmont in Elgin, grabbed Gutierrezs shirt as he fell down the front steps to the home, pulling him to the ground. After a brief struggle, Sepeda shot Gutierrez in the chest with a 40-caliber semi-automatic handgun. He then pressed the barrel of the gun against the top of Gutierrezs head and fired another round, killing him, prosecutors said. Family members inside the home bolted the front door shut but Sepeda still managed to force his way back into the home, according to the news release. He forced his girlfriend out of the home at gunpoint and then forced her and her 1-year-old daughter into his car, prosecutors said. He led authorities on a 2.5-mile chase, which, at one point reached 90 mph, before his car broke down in the 1100 block of Oakley Avenue in Elgin. Police were then able to take Sepeda into custody. On Monday, Sepeda was sentenced to 65 years in prison for the first-degree murder conviction and is required under Illinois law to serve that entire sentence. He was sentenced to 21 additional years for the aggravated and home invasion convictions. He must serve 85 percent of that sentence. Mr. Sepeda is a violent person who committed a brutal, senseless crime and tried to excuse his behavior by claiming he acted in self-defense. Although justice has been served, unfortunately, justice does not mean that Norbert Gutierrezs friends and loved ones will see him again. Still, I hope this sentence provides a sense of peace to them, Kane County States Attorney Joe McMahon said in a statement Monday. I also hope that this violent crime, which is rooted in domestic violence, helps all in the community to understand to the importance of recognizing the seriousness of domestic violence.

225,"Aimed at finding children suspected to have been abducted or in danger, the AMBER Alert system has been in effect in Pennsylvania since 2002. Now, Pennsylvania State Police have unveiled a new system that provides a similar alert for people that disappear under other circumstances, such as elderly people that may wander away from their surroundings or children who have become lost. The Missing Endangered Person Advisory Program was unveiled Saturday by State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan and will provide instantaneous information to regional police departments, news media and the public. It will operate much like the familiar AMBER Alert, but likely will be used most often when an elderly person with a disability, or a young child, wanders away from home or a caregiver, said Lt. Myra Taylor, the head of the Pennsylvania State Police public information office in Harrisburg. The MEPAS system was created to get information out as quickly as possible, through local media, so that those missing could be found as quickly as possible. Taylor said the information about the missing person is processed and sent to all municipal police departments in the area, as well as 9-1-1 dispatch centers. Simultaneously, the information is sent to local media outlets, including TV and radio stations that cover the region. They in turn, decide how and when to present the information to the public. Local police agencies are also able to put out their own requests for assistance, even if a MEPAS Alert is issued. The biggest thing to remember when a person goes missing is that you have to call 9-1-1, Taylor said. This will begin the series of events that will be necessary to implement the issuance of a MEPAS Alert. Taylor said the program could be very useful in situations where one has gone missing in inclement weather. It will be especially useful if someone, such as an elderly dementia patient, leaves a residential facility without the knowledge of the staff, she said. There could also be incidences such as a seriously ill person with a mental disability disappears, who may be in need of medication. Taylor said the MEPAS program could be used by mothers or babysitters when a young child disappears. Say for instance a child gets hurt on the playground, and while the mother is tending to her injured child, she turns around and discovers her other child has wandered away and cant be found, Taylor said. In that kind of situation, a MEPAS Alert would be issued. The system was developed by the Pennsylvania State Police through legislation, adopted last year by the General Assembly. The program is a result of a joint effort between the legislature, the state police, the Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters, the Pennsylvania Department of Aging, the Pennsylvania Chiefs of Police Association, the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Peters Township Police Chief Harry Fruecht said the new program could be a help to local police departments. Anything that can help us locate a missing child is a heck of an asset, he said. We had this before in Peters Township where a man had walked off and disappeared. We later found him in a car in a private garage. A program like this can be a big help to police departments. Fruecht said the MEPAS system sounds similar to one known as A Child is Missing, which police have also used. MEPAS could be a big help to all of us when we need it, he said. Additional information about the MEPAS program is available on the Pennsylvania State Police website.",1

229,"By Bay City News Service. REDWOOD CITY, CA- A man shot by a San Francisco police officer while attempting to carjack drivers near San Francisco International Airport after crashing a stolen car there last year pleaded no contest to attempted kidnapping and auto theft on Monday and will likely be sent to prison. Daniel Frederick, 25, was hospitalized for three days after he was shot in the abdomen by the San Francisco police officer on July 26. The San Mateo County District Attorneys Office initially charged him with seven counts -- attempted carjacking, attempted kidnapping, second-degree robbery, vehicle theft, receipt of stolen property, resisting a police officer and hit-and-run -- but he pleaded guilty to only two counts on Monday. Prosecutors said the maximum sentence he will likely receive is three years and two months in prison. Shortly after the crash, police Chief Greg Suhr called a news conference to give a detailed account of what led to the shooting. According to police and prosecutors, Frederick had stolen a Toyota Yaris from the Millbrae BART station at about 6:50 a.m. while its owner was running the San Francisco Marathon. He quickly crashed the car into a light pole on South Airport Boulevard near the North Access Road to the airport. He walked away from the crashed car and hid nearby, shedding his jacket and emerging wearing a yellow T-shirt. A police officer on a motorcycle noticed him and tried to talk to him. After a few minutes, the officer ordered Frederick to put down a backpack he was holding but Frederick ran away, heading west on San Bruno Avenue, prosecutors said. Frederick then jumped into a car stopped at a stoplight and threatened the driver, ordering him to drive away, police said. The police officer caught up with him and, thinking the driver might be an accomplice, ordered him at gunpoint not to go anywhere. The driver put his hands up and refused to help the suspect escape. Frederick ran again, taking the drivers backpack with him. He fled down a dirt road and hid in some bushes near U.S. Highway 101. Several other officers found Frederick in the bushes and ordered him out. Eventually he fled again and tried to get into several other cars parked along a frontage road there but couldnt. An officer again ordered him to stop at gunpoint. Frederick turned toward him and started approaching. The officer, whose name has not been released, fired one shot but missed and Frederick kept coming, saying shoot me, kill me as he approached, prosecutors said. The officer shot him in the abdomen. Frederick has remained in jail since he was released from the hospital. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 23, according to prosecutors.",0
230,"A 32-year-old Sarasota man faces sexual battery charges in connection with a May 2016 attack that was reported at Cracker Jacks Pub. According to the Sarasota County Sheriffs Office, the 4116 Bee Ridge Road bars manager, Matthew Gormley, was brought into custody Thursday after DNA evidence collected in the case came back as a match. The case against Gormley began to unfold shortly before 3 a.m. on May 22, 2016, when the victim alleges Gormley attacked her in the bathroom. The victim told deputies she was at the bar with another person when Gormley asked that person to leave. When the person did, Gormley is accused of locking the bars door and making sexual advances towards the woman, according to an arrest report. The woman turned down the advances and left to use the restroom, the arrest report said. Gormley, the arrest report stated, followed her, entered her stall and sexually battered her. After the alleged battery, the woman left. She was taken to a local hospital by a friend and reported the incident to the sheriffs office. When questioned in the case, Gormley told detectives he had no contact with the victim. The sheriffs office said the DNA test results indicate otherwise. Gormley was charged with sexual battery and kidnapping/false imprisonment on Thursday, March 2. He remained in the Sarasota County Jail Friday in lieu of $251,500 bond, according to jail records.

231,"The mystery of how Jonathan Elbers has continued to flee police with no resources was solved Saturday night as a home invasion report brought fresh leads in the continued manhunt for the extremely dangerous suspect. Around 7:30 p.m. Saturday, homeowners in a rural section of 25 Mile Road south of New Haven Road in Chesterfield Township returned from vacation and quickly realized something was awry, authorities said Sunday. They found he was sleeping in his bed and they found some blood, Chesterfield Township Police Chief Bruce Smith told Patch. They noticed that somebody had been (acting) like they were living in the house. The break-in answers how Elbers, whose truck and phone were confiscated by police, has had stamina to flee for what is now day three of the search. A native of Tuscola County, he has no friends or family in this Metro Detroit community and theres been no activity on his credit card. He also suffered a head wound while attempting to kidnap and kill his 20-year-old ex-girlfriend in the early Friday morning hours, police said. He lives a long way from Chesterfield, Smith said, noting that temps have dropped around the 30s when Elbers has been on the lam. This makes a lot of sense that he was in a house when the home owner was gone. On Saturday night, the multi-agency manhunt forged ahead after Elbers was sighted by the Macomb Correctional Facility in Lenox Township—deploying police, tracking dogs and a helicopter. The search was in full swing around 9 p.m. as authorities scoured a wooded area near the prison to no avail. They also checked surrounding buildings, businesses and other possible places he could be hiding. Township police, Michigan State Police, Sterling Heights K-9 Unit, Macomb County Sheriff Office and border patrol agents participated in the pursuit. The sighting followed a Friday afternoon tip that Elbers was walking on New Haven Road near Pollard Park. After that report, he eluded police during a two-hour track through woodland and a creek. The home invasion report explains how he changed clothes from the time of the abduction attempt to when he was chased Friday afternoon, police said. Elbers is charged in an arrest warrant with assault with intent to murder, a life felony; first-degree home invasion, a 20-year felony; unlawful imprisonment, a 15-year felony; and assaulting an officer causing injury, a 4-year felony. The officer suffered a minor injury while attempting to apprehend Elbers. The charges stem from when he arrived at his ex-girlfriends home in the 23 Mile and Sass area, tried binding her and stuffing her into a large plastic bag. He told her he was going to shoot her in the head, she told police said. His plot was interrupted when officers arrived at the home after receiving a phone call from the victims parents vacationing in Florida. The victim had been on the phone with someone close to her when Elbers knocked on her door around 1 a.m. Friday. His truck was found nearby with a loaded rifle and duct tape inside. After a scuffle with responding officers, he ran from the scene, police said. He is described as 510, 155 pounds with hair longer than it was in the attached picture; it is now shaggy. Anyone with information as to his whereabouts is urged to call the Chesterfield Township Police at 586-949-2322 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-SPEAK-UP.

232,"A man whose last known address is in Woodridge was found guilty Thursday of a 2015 incident in which he sexually assaulted an elderly woman in her home. Tevin Rainey, 23, was armed when he broke into the womans Westmont apartment around 5 a.m. New Years Day and forced the woman, whos more than 80 years old, onto a bed where he sexually assaulted her, States Attorney Robert Berlin announced in a release. Rainey was armed at the time of the assault. After he assaulted her, Rainey demanded money from the woman and forced her at gunpoint to drive to an ATM to withdraw cash. When he initially asked for money, the woman said she didnt have much in her home. She gave Rainey cash from both her checking and savings accounts before he demanded she drive to a nearby apartment complex and let him out. The victim was able to make it home and call 911. An ambulance transported her to the hospital for injuries sustained during the sexual assault. When police investigations led to Rainey, he was found to already be in police custody. The Woodridge Police Department, Westmont Police Department and DuPage County Crime Lab all worked to solve the case. Rainey was found guilty Thursday after a lengthy, six-day-long trial in front of Judge Brian Telander, Berlin said. Hes been officially charged with three counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault, two counts of home invasion, one count of armed robbery, one count of aggravated kidnapping and one count of armed violence. Just over two years ago, armed with a handgun, Tevin Rainey broke into an elderly womans home and sexually assaulted her in such a way that the mere thought of it makes my stomach turn, Berlin said in the release. And if that wasnt enough, Mr. Rainey then kidnapped the woman at gunpoint and forced her to withdraw $320 from her bank accounts. I cannot begin to imagine the terror that poor woman must have felt by simply being in the presence of Mr. Rainey. Rainey is next expected in court Feb. 15 for post-trial motions. Hes facing 57 to 120 years in jail, and hell have to serve 85 percent of his sentence before being eligible for parole. -- Image via Shutterstock",0
233,"A woman was pepper-sprayed, knocked down and dragged to a car while she was walking to work in San Leandro this morning but saved from abduction by a passerby who fought off the suspect, police said. Police investigators released a sketch of the suspect today and are asking for help tracking him down. The 23-year-old woman was walking to work at about 7:45 a.m. in the 14700 block of Washington Avenue when the suspect emerged from between two parked cars and pepper sprayed her, blinding her. He knocked her down and started dragging her to a silver Nissan. A man walking by stopped and tried to help her and the suspect also pepper-sprayed him. But the man kept a grip on the suspect despite being continually pepper-sprayed. Eventually the suspect broke free and fled in the Nissan, police said. Police arrived and the man and woman were both treated for their exposure to the pepper spray. Witnesses described the suspect as a black man between 25 and 40 years old standing about 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighing between 165 and 185 pounds, according to police. He has short curly black afro-style hair and a full goatee. At the time of the abduction attempt he was wearing thin-framed glasses, a collared shirt, a black sweater with a white stripe around the center, black pants and black shoes, police said. He was driving a newer silver Nissan 4-door sedan with silver spoke wheels and tinted rear windows. Police have not determined the motive for the attack.

234,"A disbarred lawyer who is also an ex-Marine was indicted by a federal grand jury in Sacramento Thursday on a charge of kidnapping a Vallejo woman in March, according to U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner. Matthew Muller, 38, of Orangevale in Sacramento, will be arraigned on the indictment before a federal magistrate in Sacramento on Monday. He is accused of breaking into a Mare Island home shared by physical therapists Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn on March 23, abducting Huskins and holding her captive for two days before dropping her off near her mothers house in Huntington Beach. The single count of kidnapping is the same charge that was previously lodged in a criminal complaint filed by prosecutors on June 29, but the grand jury action clears the way for a future trial and makes it unnecessary for a magistrate to conduct a preliminary hearing for Muller. The charge carries a possible maximum sentence of life in prison if Muller is convicted. A cell phone Muller allegedly left behind during an attempted home invasion robbery in Dublin on June 5 led authorities to evidence allegedly linking him to the kidnapping. Last month, Muller pleaded no contest and was convicted in Alameda County Superior Court on charges of attempted robbery, burglary and assault with a deadly weapon in the Dublin case. Vallejo police initially said in March that they believed Huskins and Quinns account of the kidnapping was a hoax and that the couple had led police on a wild goose chase. After Muller was charged in the federal criminal complaint, Police Chief Andrew Bidou sent the couple a letter of apology in July. Wagner said in a statement, The bizarre circumstances of the events in Vallejo in March complicated the investigation of this matter. But the Vallejo Police Department, the FBI, and our law enforcement allies in Alameda County have done excellent work in recent months to bring this investigation to a conclusion, the U.S. attorney said. Muller graduated from Harvard Law School and worked for a time as an immigration attorney. He was disbarred as a California lawyer earlier this year. --Bay City News",1

236,"Police are warning residents to be vigilant in pasadena where four armed home invasion robbers remain at large after holding a teen hostage in his home. The four men rammed their way into the home Sunday night, ransacking it while holding a teenager at gunpoint, police announced Tuesday. The boy was home alone in the 2800 block of Thorndike Road shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday when he heard a knock at the door. A man was there asking for directions and as the teen attempted to help him, three accomplices forced open a door at the back of the house, said Pasadena police Lt. Jesse Carrillo. The first suspect then brandished a firearm, holding the victim at bay, while the other suspects ransacked the home, according to a Pasadena police statement. After several minutes, the suspects left the residence, and the boy, who was unharmed, called police, who did not disclose what was taken. This incident is an anomaly in our community but serves as a reminder to be ever so vigilant in our daily lives, safeguarding our property and taking precautionary measures in our own home, said Interim Pasadena police Chief John Perez. One victim in our community is one too many and we are working to identify those involved. The suspects were believed to be in their 20s, and all wore dark clothing, according to police, who said they were following up on a number of leads . Anyone with any information regarding the robbery was asked to call Pasadena police at (626) 744-4241 or robbery investigators at (626) 744-7312.

237,"Marios Lakeway Lounge was almost empty by the early morning hours of Nov. 26, 2010, Matt Miller testified Wednesday in Lake County Court of Common Pleas. Miller -- known as Baby Matt to the regulars of the lounge -- said only four people, including himself, were still in the bar by the time he was preparing to leave. There was Annie McSween, the bartender; Joseph Thomas, who Miller had been playing pool with earlier that evening; and a third man who was working on a crossword puzzle, Miller testified. Despite being a regular at the bar, Miller said he had seen Thomas there only once before and didnt know him by name at the time. He also testified that he didnt know McSween, who tended bar there part time. It was after 2 a.m., almost closing time, and Miller recalled Thomas asking McSween to dance. No, I dont dance, McSween replied, according to Miller. Miller testified that Thomas said something to the effect of Thats odd because most bartenders like to dance. Miller would leave soon thereafter. He said it was 2:14 am when he got in his car. When Assistant Lake County Prosecutor Charles Cichocki asked Miller why he left, he replied, You can tell when the (bartender) wants to get out of there. McSween, 49, of Mentor, was murdered that night. Her body was found in a wooded area behind the bar. Thomas, 28, is on trial. He is accused of murdering and raping her. Thanksgiving night at Lakeway Lounge Miller was just one of the people at Lakeway Lounge that Thanksgiving night who testified Wednesday Thomas and Miller were playing pool together at Lakeway Lounge the night McSween was murdered. During the games, Miller noticed that Thomas had a knife clipped to his pocket. When Cichocki asked how Miller noticed the knife, Miller replied, Whenever drinking is involved, people get irate if they get beat. Ive heard of people getting stabbed or even shot over games so I tend to keep an eye on that type of stuff. Other regulars at the bar saw Thomas that night but nobody knew him by name. Bar manager Margaret March only knew him by his preferred drink -- Miller Genuine Draft in a bottle. Meanwhile, Lynette Brown-Keba testified the man with the split teeth, which is how other witnesses described Thomas, made her feel uncomfortable that night. I felt he was staring at me very often, Brown-Keba said. Brown-Keba added that, some time during the evening, Thomas approached her saying, The next dance is mine. Brown-Keba, however, declined to dance with him. Squabbles at the bar There had been some arguments at and around the bar that evening, witnesses testified. McSween had refused to serve a customer, named Jason, after he accused her of overcharging him, Brown-Keba testified. The customer left in a huff soon thereafter. (McSween) seemed out of sorts that night, Brown-Keba said. Additionally, another bar patron -- Allen Heise Jr. -- argued with March after she wouldnt let him spend the night at her house, March testified. March rented the house next door to the bar, which was also owned by bar owner Mario Cacaic. She said it was not uncommon for regulars to spend the night there if they had too much to drink. When Heise became upset with March he said something to the effect of someones going to jail tonight, March testified. However, March insisted that Heise did not mean anything by that statement. As big as he is, hes not trouble, March said. Heise did not testify Wednesday. McSween had lived in the adjacent house with March and others a few months before her death. However, she was asked to move out when other people in the house suspected her of using drugs, March said. Thumps on the wall March and another bar patron, Brian Williams, went back to the house that night and fell asleep while watching one of the Rambo films, March testified. She and Williams awoke at about 4:30 a.m. when they heard thumps on the wall behind them, March testified. March admitted that she was still a bit fuzzy at the time because of an evening at drinking. However, she saw the front door of the house get pushed open just a bit. Williams looked out the window and asked March if she knew a guy with long hair. March replied that she did not. March then told Williams to go see who was outside. According to March, Williams pulled a knife from his buckle and went outside -- shoeless, shirtless and sockless. He returned soon thereafter and said he didnt see anyone and, whoever it was, they must have run away, March testified. The next morning, McSweens blood was smeared on the outside wall of Marchs house. Her blood was also on its steps and the outside of its windows. A bloody handmark was smeared near the door. McSween was found dead and naked in a wooded area behind the bar and the house. Her nose had been collapsed by a fist, Medical Examiner Dr. Daniel Galita testified. Her back had been stabbed repeatedly and her throat had been slashed several times. The combination of the blunt force blows and stab wounds had killed her, Galita said. Police interviewed Thomas about the crime in December 2010. However, he was not identified as a suspect until April 2011. In April, police officers canvassed the neighborhood where the murder occurred, hoping to find McSweens clothes. A resident told police that he saw a man, on the Friday after Thanksgiving, standing in the rain and burning something in the backyard of 5589 Marine Parkway, Cichocki said during his opening statement. When police searched the backyard, they found the barrel containing charred clothing. DNA tests later matched blood found on the sweater to McSween, Cichocki said. Thomas was living at that Marine Parkway address at the time of the murder, though he later moved away. Thomas attorney Doughten pointed out that the evidence was not found until after Thomas had moved away. Doughten then asked why Thomas would continue to live at the house so long after the crime if he knew evidence linking him to it was nearby. Thomas has been indicted on charges of rape, tampering with evidence, aggravated robbery, kidnapping and aggravated murder. His trial will continue throughout this week with the prosecutions witnesses in Lake County Common Pleas Judge Richard Collins Jr.s courtroom.

238,"A Woodridge man was sentenced to six years in prison Wednesday for trying to kidnap two girls on separate days in 2013 in Bolingbrook. Kareem Green, 22, was found guilty in August of attempted kidnapping, aggravated battery, unlawful restraint and misdemeanor battery, according to the Will County States Attorneys Office. Prosecutors say Green grabbed a 17-year-old girl Jan. 29, 2013 while she was walking home from Bolingbrook High School, and he tried to carry her away. A passing driver stopped to help the girl and Green ran. The driver described the man and his car but didnt have a license plate number. On Jan. 31, 2013, Green reportedly followed a 16-year-old girl as she walked to her friends apartment in Bolingbrook. He grabbed her in the hallway and tried to cover her mouth, but the girl hit him with her elbow and screamed for help, according to the states attorneys office. Green ran away. Bolingbrook police investigated the car description the witness and the girls gave, and Green was identified as a suspect. The witness and the girls picked Green from a photo lineup. A dangerous man has been taken off our streets because of two brave girls who refused to become victims, a courageous Good Samaritan who refused to look the other way and dogged police work by detectives who refused to let their community become the hunting grounds for a predator, said States Attorney James Glasgow in a statement. Green must register as a violent offender for 10 years after he is released. Image via Will County States Attorneys Office.",0

240,"The following is a collection of weekly police, court and fire stories from around the Echo Park-Silver Lake area this week. When police arrested a man wanted for rape and murder in New York, he was allegedly holding another woman against her will in Los Angeles. The 22-year-old was arrested just hours after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida that left 49 people and the gunman dead. LAPD Chief Michel Moore said the department is reviewing less-lethal options after two bystanders were killed by officers this month. Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting of a little boy in South Los Angeles. Police officers were sent around 3:30 a.m. to Trumps star, which is located near Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. Police arrested two 18-year-olds and 17-year-olds allegedly coming out of a home with loot. They are suspected of other burglaries. A small brushfire broke out near Dodgers Stadium Monday afternoon. Authorities found the body of a man believed to have fallen into the water when a pedal boat capsized in Echo Park Lake. A wild rolling gun battle that ended with a hostage situation at Trader Joes claimed one life: 27-year-old store manager Melyda Corado. The cause of the Friday morning fire remains under investigation. Image via Shutterstock",0
241,"Three men are facing charges for their role in stealing a New York City mans digital wallet containing cryptocurrency valued at $1.8 million, Manhattan prosecutors announced Tuesday. Cesar Fuego Guzman, Allen Joker Nunez and Darrel Bishop Colon were indicted on felony charges of grand larceny, kidnapping, robbery, possession of stolen property, burglary and criminal use of a firearm, prosecutors said. The three men helped previously-indicted Louis Meza kidnap a man in November and steal his digital currency, prosecutors said. The robbery scheme was orchestrated by Meza, but the three men indicted Tuesday played a key role in convincing the victim to hand over access to his digital wallet — which held $1.8 million of the cryptocurrency Ether, prosecutors said. Investors arent the only ones tracking the fluctuating values of digital currencies—everyone from sophisticated cybercriminals to old-school shakedown-and-stick-up scammers are keeping a close eye, too, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., said in a statement. After Meza meet with the victim on Nov. 4 he insisted that the victim take a car service back to his Manhattan home, prosecutors said. Meza then directed the victim to get into a waiting minivan, in which Guzman, Nunez and Colon were lying in wait, prosecutors said. Nunez posed as a car service driver and began driving the victim to Uptown Manhattan when Colon, hiding in the rear of the vehicle, jumped out and threatened the victim with a gun, prosecutors said. Colon forced the victim to hand over his phone, wallet, house keys and password to his digital wallet which were handed of to Meza and Guzman, prosecutors said. Meza and Guzman went to the victims apartment and entered using his keys while Nunez and Colon continued to drive the man around Uptown for about two hours, prosecutors said. Once inside, Meza and Guzman grabbed a box containing the victims digital wallet and left the apartment with it in their possession, prosecutors said. Meza gained access to the digital wallet using the password obtained by Colon and transferred the $1.8 million in Ether into his personal account, police said. The accused ringleader was indicted in December of 2017. The victim was eventually able to escape from the minivan and call 911, prosecutors said. His identity was not revealed. As alleged in this case, the defendants worked together to carry out a kidnapping, armed robbery, and theft of more than $1.8 million in cryptocurrency, in a violent attack that demonstrates the vanishing line between street crime and cybercrime, Vance said in a statement.

249,"A 63-year-old Tampa man faces attempted kidnapping charges after Pasco County Sheriffs deputies say he tried to pick up kids at a Land O Lakes school bus stop on two recent occasions. According to the sheriffs office, the agency was alerted to the possible luring or enticing case on Friday, March 31. Detectives learned that on March 14, a silver four-door Cadillac pulled up to the intersection of Roderick Drive and Collier Parkway offering to pick up children from the bus stop, a Thursday email from the sheriffs office said. The same vehicle was again spotted at the bus stop on March 28. On the second occasion, deputies say the man behind the wheel told children he needed help finding a dog. Get the Land O Lakes Patch newsletter and alerts in your inbox. The tip to the agency led to an investigation that resulted in the April 5 arrest of Robert Fenk at his Tampa home. Detectives made contact with Fenk who at first lied, saying he was never in Pasco County, the email said. Fenk eventually admitted to being in the Collier Parkway area after it was mentioned that he had contact with law enforcement. A victim in the case identified Fenk from a photo pack, the sheriffs office noted. A victim was also able to snap a photo of the car/license plate, the email said. Fenk was brought into custody in Hillsborough County on an attempted kidnapping charge. He remained in the Hillsborough County Jail Thursday in lieu of $100,000 bond.

Thursdays car chase began in Lewisburg, reached speeds of 90 m.p.h. and then came to an end in an Arno Road ditch in southern Williamson County after sheriffs deputies deployed spike strips. When deputies searched the car, they found money, drugs and the baby, who did not belong to the driver, Tanova Ewing, or the fugitive riding with her, Wallace Duncan. When I walked up to one of the officers involved in the chase, I thought he was going to be physically ill, Captain Roddy Parker with the Williamson County Sheriffs Department told WKRN. When he discovered the child was in the car…hes a parent and he was shocked that someone would put a small kid in danger like that needlessly. The Department of Childrens Services took custody of the little boy and then re-united him with his family. He was unharmed. Duncan is wanted out of Sullivan County for aggravated robbery and kidnapping. He can add three counts of felony drug and paraphernalia charges. His bond is set at $155,000. Ewing is charged with speeding, failure to exercise due care, failure to maintain lane, reckless driving, evading arrest, reckless endangerment, possession of drug paraphernalia and three felony drug counts.

251,"Richard Lee, 75, of Creve Coeur has owned both the Manchester Road and Kingshighway locations of for 25 years, along with his bother-in-law and business partner William Choi. He tells Patch he never could have imagined what happened Sunday evening when he was kidnapped and robbed in broad daylight. As previously reported, Hard to believe in daytime, in Manchester. Its West County. Im surprised even now, Lee tells Patch. Thank God we are OK. Lee believes the heist was an inside job. Someone who knows the business or an acquaintance of someone who knows the business. I think so, somebody who knows inside. They know what Im doing on a daily basis, how to walk in, Lee said. Every detail they know. Somebody has good information. Manchester police are heading up the investigation and searching for two suspects, but they will not comment in whether they believe the assailants are familiar with Uncle Bills. Lee said it all began around 4:30 p.m. Sunday, a time when he routinely collects the weekend earnings from the restaurant. He had just emptied the safe and counted the money, about $5,000, plus another $15,000 in credit card receipts. Thats when two males entered through the unlocked, open back door of the restaurant. Somebody attacked me, Lee explained. He said each of them grabbed one of his arms, then pepper sprayed him in the face and eyes. They then forced Lee out the back door of the restaurant with the money and into his own car. They push me into my car, the back seat, Lee said. One of the guys said sit down next to him. He pushed my head to the floor. While Lee sat next to one of the suspects in the back seat, he said the other male got into the drivers seat and began driving. Lee kept his head down and could not see where they were going. I feel like we got on the highway and the driver was speeding. The back seat guy asked him, Slow down, slow down. They eventually exited around Highway 44 and Kingshighway, and left Lee and his car at Boardman Street and Shaw Avenue. Lees kidnappers stole the money from the restaurant, his cell phone and his wallet which contained credit cards, cash and his drivers license. They told him not to move or do anything for at least 10 minutes. I stayed there, like they told him and I didnt move or anything, Lee said. However, he did grab his water bottle in the car and tried to rinse out his eyes and his face. They were burning so hard. I couldnt see anything. The rinse didnt do much to help Lee and after his estimated 10 minutes, he got out of his car. I needed help. I needed some water. So I got out in the street, Lee explained. He said a woman pulled up behind him and called 911. He said he still couldnt open his eyes because of the burning from the pepper spray. Still burning hot and the smell was just so bad. Police said Lee was sprayed in the face one last time when his assailants fled from the car. While Lee waited for police, the woman who stopped to help him, ran into her house and brought him more water and towels to rinse his eyes. St. Louis Metropolitan police arrived and took Lee back to his Manchester restaurant where his wife of 46 years and business partner, Choi, were waiting. Good thing that they didnt hurt me. I was fortunate, Lee tells Patch Tuesday. Im glad Im safe. Lee is back at work, but making some changes as a result of Sundays attack. The back door will now remain locked and the locks are being changed. He is also installing a new surveillance system in the restaurant. He said has installed them in the past, but they never worked that well. He said a newer, high-tech camera system will be installed this time. Police are now searching for the two suspects who kidnapped and robbed Lee. Anyone with information on this crime is asked to contact the  at 636-527-9200. Anonymous tips can be made to the St. Louis Regional CrimeStoppers at 866-317-TIPS (8477).",1

253,"A former librarian at Stuyvesant High School was sentenced to prison on Monday for his plans to kidnap, torture and rape women and children, prosecutors said. Christopher Asch was sentenced to 15 years behind bars for his gruesome plots to kidnap and abuse women with other men. Aschs perverted emails and online chats planning the abductions were first uncovered by federal agents investigating the so-called cannibal cop, the former NYPD officer Gilberto Valle. Valle was arrested and later convicted of kidnapping after investigators uncovered the former officers extensive online fantasies about abducting, raping and eating women. His conviction was overturned within two years, after a judge ruled that Valles online chats were more likely fantasy role-play and not actual plans. Prosecutors said that Asch went further than Valle in his sadistic plans. Asch and two people he met online, Richard Meltz and Michael Van Hise, planned via email and instant messaging to kidnap, rape and kill Van Hises wife, sister-in-law and her children. Federal agents first began monitoring Van Hise, and later Meltz and Asch, after uncovering online chats between Van Hise and the cannibal cop Valle in which the two discussed their fantasies. Asch, Meltz and Van Hise strategized about kidnaping and torturing Van Hises family between 2011 and 2012, before federal agents began investigating the three men. Asch and Meltz also also fantasized and abducting and raping another woman, who unbeknownst to them was an undercover agent participating in a sting operation. Asch told a second undercover agent about his extensive plans to torture the woman, including a bag of materials he purchased to torture her. Aschs supplies included a meat hammer, a dental retractor, a leg spreader and a stun gun, according to prosecutors. Meltz and Asch were arrested in 2013. Meltz was previously sentenced to 10 years in prison. Van Hise is awaiting sentencing. Christopher Asch, a former New York City public school librarian, received a significant prison term for his involvement in two sadistic kidnapping, rape, and murder conspiracies, Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. Attorney for Manhattan, said in a statement.

254,"A 1-year-old boy kidnapped from a recycling center in his mothers minivan this afternoon was found hours later apparently unharmed and was reunited with his mother, police said. Caleb Castro and his two sisters, ages 4 and 6, were inside a red Honda Odyssey parked at SA Recycling, 1545 Gage Road, at about 3 p.m. today when a man ordered the two girls out and drove away with the boy still inside, according to Montebello police. The childrens mother, intending to recycle some items, had left the keys in the vehicle and stepped about 10 feet from the minivan, police said. The mother screamed that her baby was in the car; however the suspect fled with the vehicle out of the parking lot and southbound on Gage Road, according to a police statement. An Amber Alert was issued, and just before 7 p.m. someone reported the van was parked in the rear of a McDonalds parking lot at 9333 W. Slauson Ave. in Pico Rivera, according to Montebello police. Police found the minivan, with Caleb inside, and reunited the boy with his mother, who confirmed that it was indeed him, according to Montebello Police Capt. Luis Lopez. The boy appeared unharmed but was taken to a local hospital to be examined, police said. The suspect, who spoke Spanish and was described as Hispanic and about 30 years old, with spiked hair, remained outstanding. Video surveillance from the parking lot where the minivan was found showed the vehicle arrive just after 3 p.m. The suspect can be seen getting out of the Honda alone after it is parked and leaving the area in a different vehicle, police said. A description of the second vehicle was not immediately available. At a news conference outside the hospital where the boy was examined, the childs relieved mother, Maria Castro, told reporters she feels blessed that Caleb was not harmed. I just say thanks to him that he left the baby OK and he didnt do anything to him, she said of the suspect. Holding Caleb in her arms as she spoke, Castro admitted she erred in leaving the keys in the vehicle with her kids, but asked that people refrain from judging her. We all make mistakes in different ways, she said. City News Service",1
255,"Wanted for a shooting in Lincoln and a sexual assault in Woonsocket, Sean Almeida-Brown, 21, of Woonsocket, was surrounded by police in his Napoleon Street home Tuesday morning. Thats when officers managed to contact his mother, who was inside the single-family home. She helped convince her son to surrender. We talked him out, Capt. Michael Lemoine said. Woonsocket and Lincoln detectives were outside the house because Woonsocket officers had spotted Almeida-Browns car parked around the corner. They were hunting for him in connection with a sexual assault that happened in Woonsocket a few hours before the shooting in Lincoln. When they saw his car, they suspected he was home. Almeida-Brown allegedly robbed and shot a man on Smithfield Street in Lincoln on Monday night, but he got away. Then a Lincoln woman went to Lincoln police to report a sexual assault also on Monday night. She went police, Capt. Lemoine confirmed. However, the assault happened in Woonsocket and became a Woonsocket case. It turned out she was acquainted with this suspect from the shooting, he said. Woonsocket police interviewed Almeida-Brown after he was in custody. Based on those interviews, police believe Almeida-Brown went to Lincoln on Monday night and picked up the woman. Driving her back to Woonsocket, he assaulted her in the car several times, Lemoine said. The first-degree sexual assault happened in his house. After he drove the woman back to her Lincoln home, he also stole her phone, police allege, and used the social media app on her phone to lure his shooting victim to Smithfield Street in Lincoln. Woonsocket police charged him Tuesday with first degree Domestic sexual assault; Domestic Assault with a deadly weapon (a gun); Domestic kidnapping; Domestic Simple Assault (for the assaults in the car); Domestic Disordely Conduct; and Larceny (for stealing the phone). The bail commissioner heard the charges Tuesday but because there was a capital offense, he recommended Almeida-Brown be held until he could be arraigned in court on Wednesday. The judge ordered him held without bail at the Adult Correctional Institutions. His bail hearing is May 16. The Woonsocket charges are not the only criminal charges Almeida-Brown is facing. Lincoln Police have charged him with felony Assault With Intent To Commit Specified Felonies (for the shooting) and First-degree Robbery. And while Woonsocket police were interviewing Almeida-Brown, state police called and asked if they could pick him up. They are investigating him for allegedly sending inappropriate pictures to a juvenile female, Lemoine said. State police had a warrant. They are charging him with a felony for Electronically Disseminating Indecent Material to a Minor, according to the Judicial Portal.",0

Katrina Joy Eubanks, 51, and her husband, Garry Eubanks, 54, had been jailed in Florida since fleeing Urbandale with a dependent 19-year-old in May. Court documents indicate Katrina Eubanks worked for Mosaic, a company that provides services to people with disabilities. She was the caretaker for Airionna Bent, who is nonverbal and severely handicapped. Bent was in the Eubankses home. Eubanks reportedly injured Bent by giving her a bath in bleach and epsom salt, which caused severe chemical burns. The Eubankses then reportedly took Bent to Tampa, Fla., where Katrina Eubanks has a relative who is a nurse. Bents family had no knowledge she was missing. WHO-TV reported that Katrina Eubanks had been Bents caregiver for a year and Bents mother, Becky Bent-Weible, told the TV station that her daughter had permanent skin damage as a result of the burns.

257,"DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN, BROOKLYN — Three men were indicted Wednesday in connection with the 2014 kidnapping and murder of Menachem Stark, a Hasidic Williamsburg landlord and father of eight, the Brooklyn District Attorneys office said. Erskin Felix, 38, of Crown Heights was indicted for murder and kidnapping, while his brother, 28-year-old Kendall Felix and his cousin, 35-year-old Irvine Henry, also from Crown Heights, were indicted for conspiracy, the Brooklyn DA said. Erskin and Kendel Felix, who are cousins, accosted Stark on the street as he left his office at 331 Rutledge St. in Williamsburg on Jan. 2, 2014 at around 11:30 p.m., according to the Brooklyn DA. Stark tried to escape but was unsuccessful, and the Felix cousins forced him into a van and drove away from Starks office. Kendall and Henry Felix, also cousins of Erskin and Kendel, then met up with Erskin and Kendal, and during this time, Stark died of asphyxia apparently while being restrained, according to the Brooklyn DA. The plan formulated by Erskin Felix was to extort money from Stark using a conspiracy that included his three cousins. But when the four cousins found out Stark was dead, they rushed back to the scene of the kidnapping to get rid of any evidence. Unfortunately for them, they found the scene flooded with police, so they went to a dumpster in Nassau County, threw his body in it, and set it on fire, the Brooklyn DA said. Around 17 hours later, a Nassau County police officer found Starks partially burned body in the dumpster behind a gas station in Great Neck, Long Island, according to the Brooklyn DA. An autopsy conducted by the Nassau County Medical Examiners Office found that the cause of death was asphyxia by compression of the neck and chest. This indictment is the latest step in our journey toward justice for Menachem Stark, his seven children and the rest of the family his killers took him from, said Acting District Attorney Eric Gonzalez. This was an especially callous crime, where the defendants acted on a desire for money alone, said NYPD Police Commissioner James ONeill. Erskin Felix was arraigned Tuesday in a Brooklyn Supreme Court on second-degree murder and first- and second-degree kidnapping charges, the Brooklyn DA said. If convicted, he faces up to 25 years to life in prison. Kendall Felix and Irvine Henry, the cousins who joined the scene after the kidnapping, were arraigned Tuesday in a Brooklyn Supreme Court, charged with second- and fourth- degree conspiracy, tampering with physical evidence, attempted tampering with physical evidence, and first-degree hindering prosecution. They face up to 25 years in prison if they are convicted. Their next court date is Feb. 8, 2017.

259,"The Falls Church mother accused of abducting her 6-week-old baby last month, prompting a statewide Amber Alert, has been extradited to Fairfax County to face charges of parental abduction. Fairfax County police were called in to assist Child Protective Services on July 12. CPS authorities had been ordered to remove the baby from her mother, 31-year-old Flora Khatun of Falls Church, but had been unable to locate the mother or her child. An Amber Alert was issued when authorities came to believe Khatun had abducted the baby and had fled with the child in her vehicle in order to avoid CPS. The next day, a local reporter from TV station WUSA-9 contacted police after speaking with one of Khatuns neighbors, who believed she may know where Khatun had taken the child.

260,"A state appellate court panel today rejected an appeal from a man who slashed a clerks throat, stabbed him and tried to strangle him with a wire during a robbery at a cigar store in Manhattan Beach. The three-justice panel from Californias 2nd District Court of Appeal rejected the defenses contention that there was not substantial evidence to support Tyler Lee Rodgers conviction on one of the counts -- kidnapping to commit a robbery -- stemming from the Aug. 16, 2012, attack on Naveed Mirza at The Cigar and Smoke Shop. The evidence did not merely show that Mirza was simply moved out of sight to keep him out of view or from interfering while defendant grabbed as much money as he could. He was moved a substantial distance from the public area of the store, through two sections of hallway to a secluded room, so that defendant could violently interrogate him regarding the location of money and about the surveillance cameras, and ultimately eliminate him as a witness to the robbery, the appellate court panel found in its 12-page ruling. Rodgers went into the shop with a box, pulled out a shotgun, forced the clerk to the back of the store, handcuffed him and demanded to know where money was kept. Rodgers then collected currency from the cash register, demanded to know the location of any other money, cut Mirzas throat from one side to the other, stabbed him three times in the neck and pressed back against the victims neck with a long metal wire. Rodgers also stabbed the man in the check, multiple times in the neck and then in one hand before slashing another hand, the appellate court panel noted. Mirza survived his injuries, but had to undergo surgery and extensive physical therapy. Some of the attack was caught on video surveillance cameras until Rodgers realized that he was being recorded and started tearing out the equipment, but the footage was recovered from a hard drive, according to Deputy District Attorney Ethan Milius. Rodgers -- who was arrested eight days after the attack on the clerk -- was convicted of attempted murder and robbery, in addition to the kidnapping charge, along with a residential burglary count stemming from a June 4, 2012, break-in at a home in Torrance. During one court hearing, he reached behind himself and apparently ate his own feces. Two court-appointed doctors subsequently determined that he was mentally competent to stand trial. Rodgers also rubbed feces on his face while in a courthouse lockup during his trial before Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold. He had waived his right to a jury trial. Rodgers was sentenced in June 2013 to 40 years and eight months to life in state prison. --City News Service  PHOTO Tyler Lee Rodgers. Patch file photo.",0

263,"Its been a week since Bob and Patricia Hauser were last able to hold their grandchildren. Chase and Cole Hakken, however, will soon return to their grandparents arms, ending a search that began in Carrollwood April 3. That news officially broke just after midnight April 10. Surrounded by law enforcement officials from the county, state and FBI, Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee announced at 12:25 a.m. that the Hakken boys and their parents were safely in U.S. custody – theyre in the airspace of the United States right now. Gee said a group of law enforcement officers from the sheriffs office and FBI traveled to Cuba yesterday, April 9, to retrieve the boys and their parents, Joshua and Sharyn Hakken, from the island. An arrival time for their plane and a location were not given, but Gee did say the plane would land inside Hillsborough County. When it does both Joshua and Sharyn will face a number of criminal charges stemming from the April 3 abduction, Gee added. His announcement ended questions about Sharyn Hakkens involvement in the kidnapping. She faces a list of charges that include kidnapping and interference with child custody, Gee said. The Search Chase and Cole Hakken, 2 and 4 respectively, were in the legal custody of their grandparents Bob and Patricia Hauser when they were forcibly taken from their Shady Shores Drive home by their father Joshua Hakken last week. Deputies said Joshua Hakken, 35, tied up his mother-in-law, took the children, and fled in her car. The search for the family eventually led to Madeira Beach where it was discovered Joshua Hakken had purchased a boat. U.S. Coast Guard officials confirmed last Friday the boat left the area April 3. Read all stories related to the abduction Following that announcement, the search for the Hakkens turned to the waters around Tampa Bay. Hakkens boat, however, turned up in Cuba, sparking questions about whether or not that government would cooperate with a return of the boys and their parents. Grateful Grandparents The Hausers avoided media contact in the days following the abduction, but spoke out early Wednesday morning to express their gratitude to law enforcement and the U.S. State Department for their impending reunion with their grandchildren. Referring to law enforcement officials, Bob Hauser said: They took care of us. They helped us. They were there for us. Hauser also took a moment to thank those who prayed for the boys safe return. We are very appreciative of that, Hauser said. It was very comforting to my wife and I. Patricia Hauser stood by her husbands side as he spoke, but declined personal comment. Bob Hauser said he and his wife had a chance to speak with their grandchildren before they boarded the plane bound for American soil. Our grandchildren are safe, he said. Bob Hauser had one request. He asked that people continue to respect our privacy for the next few days as we reunite with our precious grandchildren. Details of Capture Still Murky Gee and FBI Special Agent David Couvertier said details in the case are continuing to emerge. It is unclear exactly how the apprehension of Joshua and Sharyn Hakken unfolded, Couvertier said. The way it worked out, I cant speak for the State Department, Couvertier said. This was not your typical parental kidnapping. Gee did make it clear that both adult Hakkens would be booked into the Hillsborough County Jail upon their return.

264,"The woman who reported Mondays alleged hostage incident at a Little Havana restaurant was questioned by detectives but was later released without any charges being filed, according to Miami police. Based on information the woman gave officers on Monday afternoon, heavily armed SWAT officers breached the front entrance to Joseph Restaurant only to discover there were no hostages and no one holding them. The incident resulted in two area schools being placed on lockdown for a time and traffic disruptions that lasted for hours. She did not lie about being taken hostage or being a hostage herself, Officer Michael Vega of the Miami Police Department told Patch on Tuesday. She felt like she was a hostage. Vega said that detectives were still trying to determine how much time elapsed between the time when the woman reported a hostage situation at the establishment and when police established a perimeter around the business. The restaurant is located at 1971 NW 7 Street. There was a time frame between when she told us that information to the point where it happened that we didnt have visibility of the establishment and whoever was there left, Vega said. They didnt feel comfortable arresting her because they did feel that she had it in her mind that she was taken hostage or falsely imprisoned. Vega said that the woman did not wish to press charges against the business. She felt like they told her you cannot go out there. You need to stay in here, Vega explained. Then she got rebellious and reported the incident to police. Police were already in the neighborhood from an 11 a.m. report of an alleged robbery of a mans cellphone. The man said his phone had possibly been stolen by patrons of the Joseph Restaurant. When officers arrived they were approached by the victim who was alleging that his cellular phone had been stolen from someone inside the restaurant, said Vega. He attempted to reenter the business to call police, but was not allowed. The victim was successful at calling for help from a nearby business. By 1:30 p.m. or so, the same officers were approached by the woman, who claimed that she and others were taken hostage. The woman appeared to be in distress, so the concerned officers asked if she was okay, Vega explained. The woman stated that the restaurant manager was holding her and 10 to 12 other persons hostage inside because the manager didnt want them to speak to police about the alleged robbery of the cellphone. Police then established a perimeter around the business. Vega said earlier that the SWAT team and K-9 units tried for three hours to make contact with anyone inside the business before finally deciding to enter through tactical means. Citrus Grove Elementary School and Citrus Grove Middle School were placed on lockdown for a time on Monday and residents were asked to avoid the area of NW 7 Street between NW 22 Avenue and NW 17 Avenue.

266,"- The man accused of kidnapping a cab driver earlier this month faces new charges stemming from the incident, according to police. James Castro Ruiz, 32, has been formally charged with possession of a prohibited weapon and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, the Austin American-Statesman reported. As Patch reported Feb. 10, Ruiz is a familiar face with local law enforcement given a long rap sheet dating to 2003 -- a long list of charges that include petty crimes and felony charges (see story below). Given his record, his use of a firearm in holding a cab driver captive and forcing him to drive him around automatically adds the latest felony charge. A newly released police affidavit also revealed that Ruiz knew the cab driver who was victimized, as he was a frequent customer. Once inside the cab the last time he secured the cabbies services, Ruiz pulled out a gun that he later dumped onto Interstate 35. Police later recovered the sawed-off shotgun and ammunition along the roadway. Police also identified the driver of the cab, Charles Adams. He was able to flee Ruiz during a fueling stop. Ruiz is back behind bars for his latest transgression, with bail set at $135,000. **************************************************************************************************  From Feb. 10:- The man charged this week with holding a cab driver at gunpoint while directing he be taken to his South Austin destination has a long criminal history in Round Rock dating to 2003. According to Williamson County jail records, James Castro Ruiz first got the attention of local law enforcement when he was busted with possession of less than two ounces of marijuana in 2003. From there, Ruiz graduated to bigger crimes. By 2005, he was again arrested for marijuana possession -- but this time more than four ounces. In 2011, he was charged with making household terroristic threats, and the following year charged with driving without a license. His most recent charge before the alleged cabbie kidnapping occurred in 2014, when he was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, according to records. This week, Round Rock police received a complaint from a cab driver who said Ruiz held him at gunpoint while directing him to drive to South Austin. The taxi driver was able to flee during a fuel stop, and contacted police. Law enforcement caught up with Ruiz yet again, this time charging him with aggravated kidnapping. Hes being held at the Williamson County Jail on a $75,000 bond. ************************************************************************************************** From Feb. 9:- A Round Rock man is being accused a taxi driver and forcing him, at gunpoint, to drive around Austin.

A California man who lured a Detroit teen into interstate prostitution after forcing her to perform sex acts near the Detroit Jazz Festival last year could up to 27 years in prison when he is sentenced in November. Kevin Brian Keys, 37, of Los Angeles, reportedly kidnapped the 16-year-old and took her on a cross-country sex tour and sold her online for sex with customers while authorities in Michigan searched for her, The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press report. Keys, who goes by Stac a Dollar, pleaded guilty in federal court on Aug. 10 to one count of transporting a minor to engage in prostitution. His trial was to have begun on Aug. 25. Initially, Keys was also charged with sex trafficking of a minor, production of child pornography, distribution of child pornography and possession of child pornography. Keys will serve at least 10 years in prison under the agreement, but federal prosecutors are asking that he be sentenced to between 21 and 27 years in prison, the Free Press said. The judge isnt bound by prosecutors recommendations. Prosecutors allege that Keys invited the teen, who reportedly was traveling between homes in Metro Detroit, to the Jazz Fest and told her she needed to make some money in order for them to leave Michigan, meaning prostitute herself out, Theodore Wolters, a special agent with the Department of Homeland Security, wrote in a court filing. Prosecutors said Keys promised the teen they could make a lot of money if she performed commercial sex dates and that he had done the same with a girl in California. He reportedly rented a tent near the Jazz Festival, and the girl performed sex acts for $50 to $100. Prosecutors said Keys kept the money and bought a Mega Bus ticket for himself and the teen. Keys allegedly planned to hide the girl away until she turned 18, but she became ill in Minnesota and underwent treatment at a hospital, where her true identity was discovered. She was reunited with her family on Sept. 7. Authorities began investigating Keys in early 2015 after linking him to a cell phone the girl had used to call her mother. They searched Keys computer, and discovered conversations that had taken place on Facebook where Keys allegedly tried to sell the teen for sex. He attached a nude photo of her engaging in a sex act, according to court records. The investigation against Keys was conducted by Homeland Security Investigations Operation Predator, established in 2003. Since then, investigators have arrested more than 12,000 people for sex crimes against children. Last year alone, more than 2,300 alleged predators were arrested and more than 1,000 victims were identified and rescued. Human trafficking is a $32 billion global industry, according to the International Labour Organization. About half of that activity takes place in industrialized nations, and women and girls are most often trafficked. The ILO said that in developed countries, women and children make up 11.4 million of victims (55 percent) are trafficked, compared with 9.5 million (45 percent) men. _______Photo via Shutterstock",1

According to police, Beller was helping close up the bar when three men broke in and tied up employees with electrical tape. The suspects forced Beller, of Atlanta, to an office upstairs, where they made her open a safe and then shot her in the shoulder. Once officers arrived, Beller was rushed to Grady Memorial Hospital, where she later died. The three robbers got away before police arrived. Police said theyre working to identify the remaining two men shown in surveillance videos. No crime against our citizens, anywhere in the city, is acceptable. But the robbery and murder of an innocent restaurant manager doing her job is a terrible crime that has shocked even the most jaded among us here at APD, said Carlos Campos, a police spokesman, at the time of the shooting. These crimes are unacceptable, and we will not rest in our pursuit of shutting down these violent criminals.

271,"A Santa Clara County Superior Court judge has denied a motion from a 25-year-old man to hold separate trials on charges of kidnapping and murdering 15-year-old Sierra LaMar in 2012 from three attempted kidnappings in Morgan Hill years earlier. Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Vanessa Zecher denied a motion brought by Antolin Garcia-Torres to hold separate trials on charges surrounding Sierras disappearance from the attempted kidnappings outside Morgan Hill Safeway grocery stores in March 2009. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Garcia-Torres, whose trial is expected to start later this year. Although there may be some potential prejudice to the charges remaining joined, the defendant has not made a clear showing of prejudice to support the granting of the Motion of Severance, Zecher wrote in a written order issued Tuesday. Defense attorneys for Garcia-Torres argued in their motion that the Safeway parking lot incidents didnt show a link with Sierras disappearance or indicate if the same person carried out the crime. One of the women drove away as the suspect tried to open her car door and the other two victims were assaulted as they were either entering or exiting their vehicles, according to the defense attorneys. Garcia-Torres was identified as a suspect through a latent fingerprint on a stun gun battery left behind in one of the attempted kidnappings, but the three victims didnt identify him as a suspect, according to the defense attorneys. In response to the defenses motion, prosecutors argued that the alleged crimes showed a common scheme and shared themes of intending to kidnap, stalking and assault. The jury should determine if theres enough evidence to show Garcia-Torres role in the other crimes, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said they anticipate that the Safeway victims testimony at trial will make the attempted kidnapping charges equal to the ones in Sierras case. On March 16, 2012, Sierra was last seen at her home in unincorporated Morgan Hill and didnt make the bus stop for school. The girls clothing and cellphone were found days after she went missing. Garcia-Torres was arrested about two months after Sierra disappeared after her DNA was found in his red Volkswagen Jetta, prosecutors said. Many organized searches have taken place in the four years after she was last seen, but her body hasnt been found.

276,"A manhunt that started in Florida and ended on Long Island concluded with a 14-year-old being arrested and charged with falsely reporting an incident, police say. New York State Police said they were contacted Saturday by the Broward County Sheriffs Office in Florida, who reported that a caller had identified himself as a 10-year-old child who had been kidnapped and had suffered a gunshot wound to his neck. The caller gave his name but ended the call prior to providing his location. When dispatchers tried to call him back, there was no answer. The Broward County Sheriffs Office determined that the call was coming from the area of the Southern State Parkway in Nassau County. Due to the location of the call, the New York State Police took over the investigation. The call set off a frantic search by police for the child. State police were assisted by intelligence units from the Nassau County Police, Suffolk County Police, New York City Police and the Maryland State Police. Assistance was also provided by police departments from the villages of Hempstead and Rockville Centre. Investigators eventually determined that the callers phone was in the Westbury area, and after a search of the area they made contact with the owner of the cell phone. The owner stated that her son had access to the phone earlier in the day. The mother escorted the state police team to their temporary residence at an area motel, where a 14-year-old juvenile was identified as the caller. He admitted to making the false call, and he was arrested at the scene. The boy was charged as a juvenile for falsely reporting an incident, which would be a Class A misdemeanor if he were an adult. The child was issued an appearance ticket directing him to appear in Nassau Family Court on Wednesday. In an unrelated incident, a member of the housekeeping staff at the motel approached the troopers while they were conducting the investigation. She told them she had just discovered an unresponsive guest in a nearby room. The employee stated that there were also needles and drug paraphernalia in the room. Troopers rushed to the room and found an unresponsive man. They rendered first aid and determined that he was experiencing a heroin overdose. Troopers administered Naloxone and provided first aid until an ambulance from the Nassau County Police Department arrived. The man was transported to an area hospital for admission.

279,"The Washington State Patrol is asking people not to opt out of a new mobile-based Amber Alert system after an early-morning notification that caused some to log complaints with the agency over the weekend. Did you receive an Amber Alert this weekend? Have you considered opting out of the notifications? Tell us in the comments section. WSP sent out a news release on Monday to remind people that Amber Alerts are now part of a national Wireless Emergency Alert System organized by the US Department of Justice and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The system, WSP says, works with wireless carriers to send out emergency alerts based on the real-time organizers of mobile devices. Along with Amber Alerts, the program also includes alerts issued by the president and imminent threat alerts, which include severe man-made or natural disasters. An Amber Alert went out early Sunday morning regarding the alleged abduction of a Montana boy by his parents, who do not have custody of the child. He was found safe in Fife a short time later—an outcome WSP says has been directly credited to the Amber Alert system. Its entirely possible for cell phone users to opt out of Amber Alerts by calling their wireless providers, but WSP, which administers the program in Washington state, is encouraging people not to do so. It also said an advisory committee is drafting rules that will help ensure the alerts go out ONLY when enough information is known to assist in locating the child through these methods and the timing including the time of day is conducive to public awareness. Amber Alerts have resulted in the safe recovery of more than 640 abducted children nationwide, according to the state patrol.",1
280,"Note: Patchs unsolved cases/missing persons series generally features cases from southwestern Pennsylvania. But on a trip this summer, I passed right by the small town of Tyrone Borough, just north of Altoona. Tyrone, to me, has always meant Kathy Shea. Sheas face, which appeared in newspapers and on TV at the time of her 1965 disappearance, has haunted me since I was a child because she was just a few years younger than I was. As I looked over at Tyrone from the new highway, I knew I had to share her story. Its a tale thats been told too many times: A young girl on her way to or from school vanishes into thin air. And that is the story of Kathleen Ann Shea of Tyrone, who was 6 years old when she disappeared on March 18, 1965. She was last seen traveling north between 15th and 16th streets, walking from her home to Adams Elementary School—about four blocks away. Kathy was last seen splashing in rain puddles, according to a 2010 story in the Altoona Mirror. Along the way to school, the story says, a crossing guard helped her across 15th Street, and she spoke to a woman who was watching from her North Avenue home to make sure that her own daughter reached school safely. Hours passed before anyone realized that Kathy was missing. Her kindergarten teacher thought that Kathy was out sick, and her mother thought that she was at school, according to the Mirror. What makes Kathys case disturbing is that it happened in a small, central Pennsylvania town—a place where people felt safe. According to The Doe Network website, talk of Kathy still generates a lot of interest in the area around Tyrone. Despite the best efforts of local and state police, no trace of Kathy has ever been found. Law enforcement officials checked out many leads, all with negative results. Her disappearance is considered a non-family abduction. At the time of her disappearance, Kathy was only 3 feet 11 inches tall and weighed just 47 pounds. She is described as having blue eyes and brown hair and was last seen wearing a brown hat, red gloves, red-knit sweater, brown jumper, red tights, beige coat with a fur collar and yellow boots with black soles. She would be 53 years old today. Kathys parents—Mary Alice and James Shea—never gave up hope before their deaths in 1997 and 2006, respectively. Anyone with information regarding Kathys disappearance or whereabouts is asked to contact Trooper Charles Aungst of the Pennsylvania State police at 814-696-6100.

281,"Authorities Friday sought public help to find a man who is believed to have abducted and sexually assaulted at least a dozen women and teenage girls in the south Los Angeles area in the past four years. The latest crime occurred Friday morning, and the earliest crime occurred in January of 2014, Los Angeles police Capt. William Hayes said at a news conference at LAPD headquarters. The suspect approaches females that are involved in prostitution activity, has a conversation with them, gets them in (his) vehicle, and then at gunpoint takes them to a remote area of the county near south Los Angeles, where he sexually assaults them, and then releases them, Hayes said. The victims range in age from 15 to 46 years old, Hayes said. No serious injuries have been reported. The abductions have occurred in the Alameda Corridor area, Hayes said. The corridor is a 20-mile-long rail cargo expressway linking the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to the rail network near downtown Los Angeles, according to the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority. Hayes declined to be more specific on the locations of the abductions or the locations where the sexual assaults occurred, citing the ongoing investigation. The suspect is described as black, between 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet 1 inch tall, weighing about 180-220 pounds, and about 30-50 years of age. He was bald, and had a salt-and-pepper goatee or beard. He drove a couple of different vehicles: an older-model black pickup truck with tinted windows; and a white four-door sedan, possibly a Toyota or Nissan. No license plate information was available. Hayes said the man was linked by investigators to three cases via DNA evidence, and to the other cases based on his method of operation and other undisclosed reasons. The LAPD investigation began with a sexual assault in May of this year in the LAPD 77th Street Stations jurisdiction in south Los Angeles, Hayes said. DNA evidence was obtained from that victim that led investigators to a DNA match in a sexual assault case in sheriffs jurisdiction in January of 2014. A third case also was linked via DNA to the same suspect, Hayes said. Investigators compared those cases and others, and developed a pattern to the crimes, Hayes said. Not only do we want to warn the individuals that are involved in the prostitution activity, we also want to see what information we can solicit that would identify the suspect, Hayes said. Any other possible victims, or anyone with information on the case, was urged to call detectives Dara Brown or Daniel Aguirre of the Robbery- Homicide Division at (213) 486-6910, or (877) LAPD-247.

284,"By Greg Hambrick A body found on an Albemarle County farm is believed to be the remains of Hannah Graham, according to media reports, including The Washington Post. Police have not identified the body, but the case is now considered a death investigation, according to WUSA9. A college sophomore, Graham disappeared in downtown Charlottesville on Saturday, Sept. 13. The last anyone heard from her was a text at about 1:20 a.m. Graham is a 2013 graduate of West Potomac High School in Fairfax County, south of Old Town Alexandria The last person seen with Graham, Jesse Matthew Jr., 32, is being held on charges of abduction and intent to defile in the case. He was arrested in Texas on Sept. 24. Vigils and desperate searches for Graham continued for weeks since her disappearance, even as police attention turned to farmland outside of Charlottesville. Matthews behavior after becoming a person of interest in the case only fed concerns that Grahams night of partying in downtown Charlottesville had ended in tragedy. In late September, state police announced that Matthews arrest offered a new forensic link to the 2009 death of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old who was killed after attending a concert at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. The FBI has previously linked Harringtons death to a sexual assault in the City of Fairfax in 2005. Also read:",0

As they attempted to conduct the traffic stop, the subject fled. A small chase ensued in which the subject crashed his vehicle. It was at that point that Cano allegedly opened fire on the officers with the assault rifle. Our officers returned fire, and subsequently one of the officers was hit by the gunfire of the subject, Ramirez said referring to Fluty.

288,"A murder suspect accused of sexually assaulting and trying to kill a woman in North Hollywood reportedly told police hes killed many times before. Danueal Drayton, 27, of New Haven, Connecticut, pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that he sexually assaulted and attempted to murder a woman after they went on a date and headed back to her her North Hollywood apartment. Drayton was wanted for murder and rape in New York, and he was allegedly holding a woman hostage in North Hollywood last week when police caught up with him. According to the New York Daily News, Drayton confessed to committing two murders in Connecticut, one in the Bronx, one in Suffolk County, one in either Queens or Nassau County, and possibly another California homicide. My body did this, not my mind, the paper quoted Drayton as telling investigators. I didnt want to do this. My body made me do this. According to the police source who, however, that it was unclear if Drayton was telling the truth about the additional crimes. Authorities believe Drayton preyed upon women he met through online dating sites. When police caught up with him, Drayton was wanted for killing Samantha Stewart, a 29-year-old nurse found dead in her Queens apartment on July 17. Stewart was found dead by her father and brother, and authorities later determined that she had been strangled. Police now believe Drayton also raped a woman in Queens a month before Stewart was killed. He seemed to be repeating his pattern of rape and strangulation in the North Hollywood attack, according to police. Drayton was arrested about 5 p.m. on July 24 by police in North Hollywood. He is accused of sexually assaulting the 28-year-old woman, trying to strangle her and refusing to let her leave her apartment, according to Deputy District Attorney Elan Carr. The Daily News also reported that Drayton was released by authorities at a July 5 hearing in Nassau County after his arrest for choking his girlfriend in Inwood Park. The judge ruled that Drayton posed no flight risk, rejecting the county district attorneys call to hold him on $7,500 bail. It would have been impossible for the judge at that time to foresee the allegations that are presently unfolding and coming to light, a Nassau Court spokesman told the Daily News. That was far from Draytons only brush with the law. Drayton was supposed to be arraigned Friday, but he refused to board a bus meant to take him to court, according to ABC7. If he refuses to voluntarily appear for his rescheduled arraignment Monday, a court order will be issued to force him to appear. He is charged with one count each of attempted murder, forcible rape, false imprisonment by violence and sexual penetration by a foreign object, and could face up to life in prison if convicted as charged in the North Hollywood case. He has been bouncing in and out of Connecticut prisons for the past several years after multiple convictions. He was convicted of unlawful restraint and violation of a protective order in relation to a 2012 incident in New Haven. He was sentenced to two years in prison. He also has a strangulation conviction for a 2011 incident in East Haven for which he was sentenced to three years in prison. He was convicted of violating a protective order in Waterbury during 2015 and was sentenced to two years in prison. Most recently he has a harassment conviction for a February 2018 incident in New Haven.

294,"A state appeals court panel has upheld a mans conviction for kidnapping a 79-year-old woman during an August 2012 robbery-motivated attack inside her South Pasadena home. In a ruling released Monday, a three-justice panel from Californias 2nd District Court of Appeal rejected the defenses contention that a judge should have granted Alonzo Bernard Johnsons motion for acquittal on a count of kidnapping to commit robbery. Johnson surprised the woman in the kitchen, struck her across the side of her face with her phone, demanded her money, struck her again in the face, grabbed her and pushed her into the bedroom, where he struck her over and over with a closed fist on Aug. 6, 2012, the panel noted in its 10-page ruling. The justices found that Johnsons movement of the woman was sufficient to ensure that she was no longer visible from the front of the house, reducing the likelihood of detection by others, and that the attack ceased only after he was discovered by her grandson. Johnson was convicted of kidnapping to commit robbery and first-degree residential robbery involving that attack, in which the woman suffered a brain bleed and ruptured ear drum. He was also convicted of first-degree burglary with a person present involving a June 22, 2012, home burglary in Pasadena, in which another 79-year-old woman walked into her bedroom and found him stealing jewelry before he fled from the home. He was sentenced in August 2016 to 95 years to life in state prison. City News Service; Photo: Patch Archive",1

306,"Los Angeles police released video of a mysterious kidnapping Wednesday in hopes that someone will recognize the victim or suspect. The video released by the Los Angeles Police Department shows a man grabbing a woman by the hair and shoving her into his van on a residential street in Sylmar. The eerie video shows the man and woman talking to one another seemingly calmly, but he seems to be stalking her footsteps and preparing to grab her as she paces outside the van. The kidnapping occurred about 12:30 p.m. in the 15000 block of El Cajon Street, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The video suspect is a heavy-set man who drives Chrysler minivan, possibly a Town and Country, police said. The female attempts to walk away, but the male follows her, according to a police statement. He then opens the sliding door of the van as he continues to talk to her. The male grabs her by the hair and forcibly throws her inside the van. The woman vainly tries to escape, but the man pushes her back into the van before he gets into the drivers seat and drives off with the victim still inside, police said. The man then calmly walks around to the drivers seat and pulls away. The woman appears to be Hispanic, 25-35 years old with long back hair. The man is around 30-35 years old and weighs about 250 pounds. He wore a baseball cap turned backwards. It appears as if the suspect and the victim know each other, police said, adding that the motive for the kidnapping is unknown.

Fox2Now is reporting that the boy, Carmon Cross, is Jones cousin and that he happened to be in the car when she took it. Originally, they were each believed to be foster children, but the two both live in the Bel-Noir home with relatives.

308,"In what police are characterizing as a well-orchestrated heist, a group of armed men invaded a Meriden apartment Thursday night, bound and gagged four victims, kidnapped two and brought them to a Fairfield jewelry store, where they stole more than $4 million worth of items. The suspects, who police said were wearing ski masks and armed with firearms, are still at large. Fairfield Police said its department along with police agencies throughout the state and region are looking for a vehicle that the suspects used — a silver 2009 BMW 528i bearing Massachusetts license plate 96NV02. The vehicle is owned by one of the victims, an employee of Lenox Jewelers who was staying at an apartment in Meriden that is owned in part by the company, according to police. Anyone who may have seen the vehicle is encouraged to call Fairfield Police at 203-254-4840. It was 10:51 p.m. on April 11 when Fairfield Police received a 911 call from two victims at Lenox Jewelers, located at 2379 Black Rock Turnpike. They had been bound and gagged, police said, and were able to free themselves to call police. Police were on scene within a matter of seconds, said Assistant Police Chief Chris Lyddy, and Fairfield officers as well as departments throughout the area immediately began a search for the BMW. Meanwhile, at 10:52 p.m., Meriden Police recieved a 911 call from two victims who has been bound and gagged at an apartment in that town, located at 120 Gravel St., Unit No. 71. They, too, were able to free themselves after the armed suspects left, police said. None of the victims were injured during the incident, according to police. Lyddy said a preliminary investigation has revealed that two of the victims left the jewelry store after closing at 8 p.m. They are managers, he said. They traveled to their apartment in Meriden and, upon arrival, were forced into their home by at least four armed suspects wearing ski masks. The type of firearms displayed was not immediately known, police said. Two other individuals, acquaintances of the store managers, also showed up at the apartment around that time. The suspects bound and gagged them, police said. Fairfield Police Lt. James Perez said two of the suspects then took the managers back to the jewelry store in the BMW. They reportedly forced the managers to open the door, unarm the security system and open the safe. The suspects stole a variety of jewelry that has been estimated at a value of between $4 million and $5 million, police said. It was organized, Lyddy said. The people involved obviously knew what they were doing. The amount stolen makes it one of the largest dollar amounts stolen in the towns history, he noted. This wasnt just a random opportunity, Perez added.",1
309,"Royal Oak police said a Saturday morning report that a man had barricaded himself inside a house and taken two hostages at a house in the 1100 block of royal was actually an instance of swatting, a hoax that has been sweeping the country. Royal Oak police and the Southeast Oakland County SWAT team responded to the residence about 11:04 a.m. after receiving a 911 call in which an unknown suspect claimed he had stabbed two females at the residence and was armed with a shotgun, according to a police statement. Police established a perimeter and advised neighbors to remain in their homes. The annual Mind Over Matter 5K run/walk was diverted to ensure the safety of the race participants. After about an hour officers began to realize this may be a swatting call, which is a term commonly used to describe a false report causing a significant police response, Royal Oak police said in a news release. Related: During the incident, police made contact with a man inside the house, who was working at his computer in the basement and was unaware of the heavy police presence outside his residence. After interviewing him, police realized they had been punked. False reports of this nature create a very dangerous situation for responding emergency services and the community, police said in the statement. The person who called in this fake report committed a felony, which carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. In a similar hoax last year, police in West Bloomfield dispatched a special operations team after receiving a call from a man who claimed he had shot his wife with an AK-47, planted explosives throughout the condo, and taken a neighbor hostage and killed him. Also last year, Oakland County sheriffs deputies responded to a residence in Independence Township after getting a call that a man with a machine gun had taken hostages. The FBI says swatting has resulted in some close calls, including the injury of a police officer en route to a hoax. Also, the FBI said, some victims have suffered mild heart attacks when SWAT teams show up at their doors. The hoaxes are usually the work of a computer hacker whos able to make it seem a call came from a specific address.",1

Mark Soliman, 41, of Pacifica, did not enter a plea to kidnapping and assault with an intent to commit sexual assault and will return to court on Nov. 30, according to the San Mateo County District Attorneys Office. Shortly after 4:30 p.m. Monday, the girl was in the 600 block of Hickey Boulevard near a day care center and was walking to a friends house when Soliman allegedly drove up alongside her and told her she looked pretty, prosecutors said. The girl kept walking and he then came up behind her and threw her into the backseat of his black Volkswagen. The girls friend saw what happened and ran up to help her. Soliman allegedly slipped and the girls were able to get away, prosecutors said. He then drove away, but Pacifica police used a law enforcement database to determine Soliman was the cars owner. He was arrested at his home at about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, police said. Prosecutors said Soliman has a lengthy history of similar conduct. – By Bay City News Service / Image credit: Pacifica Police",0
311,"The man involved in the 6-hour standoff with Mentor Police Thursday has been identified as Antonio Iaconianni. Iaconianni was staying in Mentor. He turned 24 today. He surrendered to police peacefully at about midnight after hiding for more than 6 hours beneath a front porch of a home on Mansion Boulevard on Mentor. Iaconianni is in Mentor Jail at the moment and may be arraigned this afternoon in Mentor Municipal Court. Though he has not been charged yet, he will likely face charges of aggravated menacing, carrying a concealed weapon, obstructing official business and inducing panic. The standoff began at about 5:30 p.m. with an argument at the nearby Mentor Square Apartments. A bystander who lives in the apartment complex, Orlando Figueroa, said two men -- one of who was Iaconianni -- were arguing and management called police to break it up. When officers arrived, Iaconianni ran away. In fact, he jumped off a balcony to get away, Mentor Police Capt. Ken Gunsch said. He then hid beneath a porch on a Mansion Street home near the Center Street intersection, said Gunsch. Iaconianni had a handgun with him when he hid beneath the porch, Gunsch said. However, he had no gun when he surrendered. Police found his suspected weapon, a .357, soon thereafter. At no time during the standoff did the man have any hostages, Gunsch said. Dawn Argie lives nearby the home where the man his. Police evacuated her and her family from their home. Officers told her the man was threatening to kill everyone. However, the standoff was resolved peaceably. He realized there was nowhere for him to go, Mentor Police Capt. Ken Gunsch said. Gunsch said police opted to coax the armed man from beneath the porch with negotiation as opposed to forcing him out with gas or a water hose because they wanted the standoff to end safely for everyone. Our best option was to keep talking to him and for it to end peacefully, he said.",0

313,"Another birthday missed, another legal obstacle, another year with no sign of Sarah and Jacob Hoggle, two Clarksburg children taken from their home nearly two years ago by their mentally unstable mother. During her childrens mysterious absence — Catherine Hoggle has said only that the youngsters are safe with someone — their father and Hoggles mother have begged her for answers, only to be met with silence. Despite nearly two years of treatment at a state mental hospital, Catherine, the mother responsible for the September 2014 disappearance of Sarah, now 5, and son Jacob, now 4, is still not competent to stand trial. A Montgomery County judge will not let police question the schizophrenic mom about what she did with the siblings. I am disappointed that the focus is not on Sarah and Jacob – on looking for them – regardless of any interview with my daughter, Lindsey Hoggle told Patch. I believe they are with someone, as she has indicated. Jacob was last seen with his mother on Sept. 7, 2014, in Darnestown or Clarksburg; Sarah was last seen with Hoggle on the morning of Sept. 8, 2014. Catherines family says she is paranoid and was making plans to leave the area, so she gave the young children to someone for safekeeping. On Sept. 12, 2014, Hoggle was found and arrested in Germantown. Police and prosecutors accuse the siblings mother of taking them from the family home in September 2014 and suspect she killed the youngsters. SEE ALSO: Lindsey Hoggle says the childrens case should involve the police departments missing persons unit; the Major Crimes Division took the lead in the investigation before Catherine was located. In reviewing all of the tips this spring, a Facebook friend who knew Catherine sent photos of what may have been Catherine at a playground in the Hamptons subdivision close to where she was found. The grandmother says she believes they are Catherine and Jacob, but is less sure about Sarah. If this is true, then she did not harm Sarah and Jacob initially as thought, Lindsey said. Legal Rulings, Frustration Mounts Judge Eugene Wolfe said in June 2016 that medical evaluations indicate that Catherine remained incompetent to stand trial on charges of neglect, obstruction and hindering in the case. Until she can face trial, the judge will not allow her to be interrogated about the fate of the children. Catherines rights shouldnt outweigh those of her children, says her longtime partner Troy Turner of Clarksburg, the father of Sarah and Jacob. I dont understand how you leave the victims out of the system. My kids have no representation in the courtroom. … Theres really no way to insert them in a case that should be all about them, he told Montgomery Community Media. The focus on the two missing children has been lost in the struggle over their mothers court-mandated commitment, which has stifled investigators, he said. The focus is simply bringing my kids home. Whether theyre alive or dead, they deserve to come home, and thats where the focus needs to remain. Wolfe set a new court status hearing for Sept. 27. »Find updates on the FindSarahFindJacob Facebook page. Hoggle is a schizophrenic who reportedly refused to stay on her medication. Turner has said in interviews and on social media that Catherine understands her situation based on conversations with her and that she should be questioned in court about the childrens fate. Police interviewed Catherine for more than 10 hours when she was first found, her mother said. While Lindsey spoke with her daughter several times a day for part of 2015, she has not seen her since Catherine fled home with the children. Isolation for any mental patient is unacceptable; there are ways to encourage family support and involvement without disclosing facts that she is not ready to share, Lindsey said. Turner recently created the Change.org petition Justice for Sarah and Jacob as a way to push things forward and hopefully change the decisions made in the judicial system, he says. Sarah and Jacob Hoggle were taken by their mother, Catherine Hoggle, almost two years ago never to be seen again. She remains in an inpatient psychiatric facility where she is protected by patient rights, Turner says on the petition site. Police and other important officials are unable to question her as to the whereabouts of the children due to Judge Wolfes order. We are asking this order be lifted so we can finally bring our children home. On the petition, Turner calls Catherine a criminal who confessed to the childrens abduction. I also cant understand why a judge or any human being for that matter would do anything to obstruct their return (dead or alive they deserve to come home), Turner wrote. We are begging the court that this order be lifted so we can get closer to bring my children home. And while the legal battle goes on, Turner and supporters said last week that they will plan another search soon for signs of the children. A search in early April of Goshen Recreational Park in Germantown yielded nothing. A GoFundMe site has been established to pay for the costs tied to searches.

315,"A Douglas County man will spend life in prison after he pleaded guilty to a violent 2015 home invasion. Quamar Rashad Brown, a three-time convicted felon, was sentenced to life in prison plus an additional 20 years by Superior Court Judge William H. Beau McClain. Brown pleaded guilty to armed robbery, home invasion and kidnapping at gunpoint in the October 28, 2015 incident. On that day, Brown approached the home of his victim — a man in his mid-60s — on Blanche Drive and rang his doorbell. When the victim answered the door, Brown posed as a salesman with vacuum cleaner parts he was offering to sell. The victim said he wasnt interested and attempted to shut the door. But Brown wedged the door open, forced his way inside and pulled a semi-automatic handgun and held it to the victims head, demanding money. Brown took his wallet, with almost $400 inside along with several credit cards and an AARP card, stole the keys to the victims Camaro and his cellphone, then forced the victim at gunpoint into a closet as the man begged for his life. He then fled the scene of the crime in another vehicle. Shortly afterward, Brown was pulled over by Douglas County Sheriffs deputies, who found the victims credit cards inside the vehicle. A search of Browns home revealed the victims wallet, keys and cellphone. Investigators were able to pull fingerprints from the items Brown was pretending to sell. And he was wearing an ankle monitor at the time due to a previous court order out of Louisiana. Investigators were able to contact the monitor company and determine that Brown was at the scene of the crime. Senior assistant district attorney Steve Knittel, who prosecuted the case, said that due to Browns lengthy criminal history, which includes three prior felony convictions, and the severity of his crime, the judges sentence was an appropriate one. In a news release, District Attorney Brian Fortner agreed. These kind of criminals have no place in our community. They do nothing but serve as a menace to society by kidnapping and robbing people at gunpoint in their own homes, a place that is supposed to be a persons sanctuary, Fortner said. Judge McClains sentence reflects the serious and dangerous nature of this crime and ensures no one else will have their safety and security violated by Quamar Brown. Image via Shutterstock",1
316,"- Jurors deadlocked Thursday in the penalty phase of trial of a man who killed a young woman during a rape in Glendale 37 years ago. The jury that convicted Darrel Mark Gurule of murder was unable to reach a unanimous verdict in the penalty phase, with 10 voting in favor of recommending life in prison without parole and two recommending death. A hearing was set for Dec. 2 to determine the next step in the case. Gurule was convicted Sept. 28 of first-degree murder for the shooting death of 23-year-old Barbara Ballman. During the penalty phase of trial, Deputy District Attorney Jonathan Chung showed the eight-man, four-woman panel a photo of Ballman, whose naked body was found in the early morning hours of Sept. 21, 1979, inside her Volkswagen sedan parked across from Edison Elementary School. That image was followed quickly by a photograph of a bloodied Roberto Bruno, whom Gurule was previously convicted of murdering. Bruno was shot in the head in 1987. Chung said witnesses and transcripts show that Gurule, 57, also kidnapped and sexually assaulted another woman in 1977, assaulted two brothers in 1979, robbed a man in 1982 and received stolen goods in 1986. Defense attorney Philip Peng asked jurors to choose life. At minimum, Darrel Gurule will die in prison. Hes never going to get out, Peng said. During his 10,592 days in custody, Gurule has never threatened anyone, never harmed anyone, the defense attorney told jurors. The question is does Darrel die on Gods time or is he going to die on mans time? he said. Gurule grew up in Echo Park in the 1960s and 70s, when the area was controlled by warring gangs, Peng said. Darrels father was an extremely vicious man with heavy hands, who regularly beat his wife Lydia and their eight children, the defense attorney said. He pointed to Gurules troubled childhood as a mitigating factor weighing favor of a life-without-parole sentence. On July 4, 1973, Gurule was found with six of his siblings, ages 4-17, in what police had thought was an abandoned house in Glendale, devoid of furniture other than a few mattresses. Officers found rotting food all over the floor and a kitchen floor covered with newspaper and feces, Peng said. Gurules father was out of the picture by then and his mother was out on a date. Ballman was killed on Sept. 20, 1979, sometime after leaving her older sisters home at 7:30 p.m. Linda Benjamin told jurors that her sibling moved to California after she did. When she first came out, I felt responsible for her well-being, Benjamin said. Ballman took classes at Glendale College and worked at a group home and residential treatment center for young women called Penny Lane. I hate that she ... was murdered on my watch, Benjamin said, reading from a journal she kept after her sister was killed. If I could have had only five more minutes with you it would have made my life more bearable, she read. I would gladly trade places with you to do the hard part. Its just a thing I will never be able to understand, she wrote in referencing the tragedy and horror of your death. Benjamin referred more than once to Gurule as a monster and said she was not only sad, but angry that coward, that monster is still walking around. Jurors found true special circumstance allegations of murder during the commission of a rape and murder with a prior conviction but deadlocked on a third special circumstance allegation -- murder during the course of a robbery. Gurule wasnt charged with Ballmans murder until 2010. Glendale police said semen evidence was recovered from the victim, who had been shot in the abdomen, but DNA analysis was not available at the time. In 2004, Gurules DNA was submitted to a law enforcement database. When Glendale police re-opened an investigation into Ballmans killing and submitted the semen evidence to the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Departments crime lab, a match was made with Gurules DNA. Gurule was 19 at the time of the killing and has been serving a life prison sentence since 1987 for the kidnap-murder of Bruno, which detectives believe was the result of a drug deal gone wrong. -- City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",0

318,"The parent link notification system at Dorchester County School District Two serves a simple purpose: let parents know their children were absent and remind them to bring an excuse the next day. These notifications are sent after 4:30 p.m. But one parent wants to change that and has started a petition to get the absentee alert system sooner so parents can be notified earlier in case the child is abducted from the bus stop. Click here to see the petition. But district spokeswoman Pat Raynor said the system is not intended to alert parents of a kidnapping but to be used as a reminder for them to bring an excuse the following day. She added that there are security measures in place at schools to prevent child abductions, and that if parents are worried about leaving their children unattended at the bus stops, they can drop them off early at school. We have quite secure schools, Raynor said. (The notification system) is a wonderdul resource but its not the only way to ensure your childs safety. Candise Gore is behind the petition. Her child attends Spann Elementary. She wrote in an email to Patch: A recent vacation  my family went on has brought a safety concern  with summerville schools to my attention. Over the five-day vacation my family went on, Dorchester District 2s Spann Elementary School, who uses the parent link system, failed to notify me of my childs absence until 4:50-5:10pm each day for the five consecutive days. The school board and school have explained to me that calls do not START going out to parents until 4:30pm for any childs absence in grades k-12. This is a safety concern especially in todays economy when both parents have to work and cant afford to wait with their children at the bus stop. If a child is abducted while waiting for the bus or  on  his or her way to school the parents or guardian, AS OF NOW, will not be notified that their child failed to attend school until 4:30 pm at the earliest. Raynor said the district isnt ignoring Gores concern. Were taking her suggestions and concerns very seriously, Raynor said.",0
319,"A Las Vegas man wanted for the 2008 murder of his wife is the newest addition to the FBIs 10 Most Wanted List. Jesus Roberto Munguina is charged with kidnapping and killing his wife, 29-year-old Sherryl Sacueza. This was a vicious killing, said Special Agent Andrew Attridge, who is investigating the case from the FBIs Las Vegas Division. Attidge said that the couple had split, each having accused accused the other of having an affaor. She had taken their four kids, aged six through 12, and fled. A few nights later he convinced her to come home, Attridge said. According to Attidge, when she arrived back, Munguia forced the kids into the bedroom and locked the door. He then forced his wife into her car, drove her to a secluded location, bound her hands with the setbelts, and then tied to her the seat with jumper cables. At some point, he beat her to death with a blunt object, possibly the handle of a tire jack, according to Attidge. The FBI says that he then drove back to his house, left his dead wife in the car, and fled. Saucezas sister found her. He was charged with kidnapping and murder but fled. That led to federal charges of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. Munguia was born and raised in Los Angeles where was a member of the gang TEPA 13, according to the FBI. In LA, he acquired an extensive criminal record, the FBI says. He had arrests for car theft and assaulting a police officer. We believe Munguia continues to have extensive family ties and gang ties to Southern California, Attridge said, especially in Los Angeles and Bakersfield. He may have also fled to Tijuana, Mexico or deeper into Mexico. Munguia has several distinguishing features that may help someone recognize him. He has a tattoo of a teardrop near his left eye, and a tattoo of the letters PA on the back of his neck. He is also missing his right index finger. We know he is a violent individual, Attridge said, He also appears to be smart in terms of evading capture. Munguia has been known to use his deceased brothers identity to get jobs—using his real name could lead authorities to him because of the outstanding warrants for his arrest. We believe that Munguia will do anything to evade capture, Attridge said. He should be considered armed and extremely dangerous. The FBI says that if you have information regarding Munguia, contact your local FBI office or the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate, or submit a tip online at https://tips.fbi.gov.

324,"Two wanted fugitives were apprehended due to the work of a recent partnership between the U.S. Marshals Service Great Lakes Regional Fugitive Task Force and the Kendall County Sheriffs Office. Jacob H. Reddick, 26, of Aurora, and Kenny King, 25, of Oswego, were apprehended Jan. 12 and Jan. 27, respectively. Reddick was wanted by the Oswego Police Department for two counts of kidnapping, aggravated domestic battery by strangulation, two counts of domestic battery, unlawful restraint and theft. Reddick was arrested in the 800 block of Front Street in Aurora. He had been a fugitive since December 2015. King was wanted by the Oswego Police Department for forgery, obstructing justice, retail theft and resisting a peace officer. King was arrested in the 300 block of Springbrook Trail South in Oswego. He had been a fugitive since December 2014. Both arrests were credited to an investigation by the task force. In January 2016, the Kendall County Sheriffs Office assigned a deputy to be a full-time participant in the task force. The partnership formed between the U.S. Marshals Service and the Kendall County Sheriffs Office has quickly led to the apprehension of two fugitives and helps us in achieving our goal of keeping the citizens of Kendall County safe, said Sheriff Dwight A.

325,"The horrifying attacks today in Paris are likely the work of the Islamic State, according to the research director of the UC San Diego Institute of Global Conflict and Cooperation. If you look at the targets, none of them have any political significance, economics professor Eli Berman told City News Service. Theyre just civilians -- kids at a rock concert, Cambodian restaurant, people at a soccer game. With a possible fourth target of a cafe, it appears to be arbitrary violence, Berman said. He stressed that his views were based on preliminary information coming out of France. Authorities reported that scores of people were dead as a result of the attacks, which took place close to the site of the Charlie Hebdo massacre that occurred in early January. According to French police, as many as 100 people had been taken hostage at a theater where a concert was taking place, and officers were met by gunfire as they approached. Meanwhile Facebook has set up a Safety Check page to help its members determine whether any friends or loved ones were near the danger zones. The band that was performing, Eagles of Death Metal, originated in Palm Desert and performed Oct. 21 at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach. Band members were said to be safe. France and other European nations have been alarmed at the large number of citizens who have traveled to the Middle East and received terrorism training. Officials believe that two brothers who took part in the Charlie Hebdo attack were connected with al-Qaida in Yemen, which has called for attacks on Western targets. Berman replied emphatically, no, when asked whether Americans should be worried here at home. The number of returnees here in the United States is much, much smaller, and our control of our borders is much, much better, Berman said. Our ability to track returnees is far superior. San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer said, Our prayers tonight are with the people of Paris. Although there are no credible threats in San Diego, local law enforcement is closely monitoring this situation, coordinating with state and federal authorities, and taking all necessary precautions, Faulconer said. We ask everyone to remain vigilant and if you see something, say something. Meanwhile, former City News Service reporter Jessica Plautz posted numerous pictures and short videos on Twitter from Paris, where she was covering an AirBnB conference. Among them were photos of eerily quiet streets, police with guns drawn and a family that escaped from an area inside a police barricade. Plautz is now the Mashable travel editor. --City News Service Photo via AP Video posted above",1
326,"A 19-year-old student feared for his life while he was kidnapped by a man police said forced him to get money and drive around Paterson so he could get drugs and solicit prostitutes, police said. The student was at the drive-thru window at McDonalds in Wayne at 9 p.m. Thursday when Travis Mann asked to use his cell phone to contact his family, said Detective Capt. Laurence Martin. The man got into the students truck and threatened to harm him if he did not drive him to Paterson to purchase drugs; Mann was allegedly smoking synthetic marijuana and acted very irrationally, Martin said. Mann forced the student to withdraw $190 from his checking account at ATMs, drive him to Paterson where he purchased and smoked crack cocaine and solicited prostitutes, the captain said. The victim said he feared for his life, Martin said. Mann, 35, allegedly told the student to drive him to his hometown of Wanaque where, at about 3 a.m. Friday, the victim escaped from Mann, contacted the manager at a 7-Eleven, who called 9-1-1, Martin said. A Wanaque Police officer immediately responded to the scene and struggled with Mann, who tried to run, before taking him into custody, Martin said. Mann was wearing an ankle bracelet, which he showed to the student, stemming from him allegedly robbing an Elmwood Park Walgreens Feb. 25, police said. Mann acted disorderly and threatened officers while being processed at Wanaque Police headquarters, Martin said. He was then taken to Wayne Police headquarters where he continued to act irrationally; he was placed in a holding cell before being taken to the Passaic County Jail, he said. Mann was charged out of Wayne with carjacking and kidnapping. Wanaque Police charged him with making terroristic threats, hindering apprehension, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, failure to surrender narcotics to law enforcement, possession of crack cocaine, tampering of evidence, obstruction and possession of drug paraphernalia.

329,"The ringleader of a $37 million computer chip heist in Fremont in 2011 that is believed to be the largest such heist in Silicon Valley history pleaded no contest today to four robbery counts in an agreement that calls for him to get an 18-year state prison term. Faustino Adona, 46, of San Jose, entered his plea in Alameda County Superior Court shortly before he was set to go on trial and will be formally sentenced by Presiding Judge Morris Jacobson on Nov. 27. Adona was one of 16 men who invaded Unigen Corp., a silicon and modules design and manufacturing company, at 45388 Warm Springs Road in Fremont at about 8:45 a.m. on Feb. 27, 2011, a Sunday, California Deputy Attorney General Ralph Sivilla said. Authorities said the men, who were from San Jose and Union City, wore masks and dark clothes and were armed with handguns and rifle. They bound five Unigen employees at gunpoint and forced them into a backroom. The suspects then loaded nearly 2 million flash memory chips onto a large truck and drove away at 9:11 a.m. that day, according to police. Authorities later determined that the heist was an inside job because two of the suspects worked at Unigen, which is now based in Union City. As part of its investigation into the heist, Fremont police enlisted the help of the Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team, or REACT, a high-tech crimes unit of the Santa Clara County District Attorneys Office. The investigation quickly led to the recovery of nearly 1.5 million of the stolen chips locally and in Asia. Two of the suspects remain at large but most of the suspects were arrested within a few months of the large robbery, Sivilla said. Adona was arrested in the Philippines and it took a long time to get him extradited to the U.S. so he could be prosecuted here, he said. Adona is the last of the 14 suspects whove been arrested to resolve his case, according to Sivilla. The men were charged with multiple counts of armed robbery and kidnapping for robbery. In exchange for Adonas no contest plea to four counts of robbery, prosecutors agreed to dismiss the kidnapping charges he faced. Sivilla said most of the other defendants were sentenced to state prison terms ranging from 15 to 17 years. He said the defendants apparently planned to sell the stolen computer chips to foreign tech companies. Jacobson said the 14 defendants cumulatively are ordered to pay $782,600 in restitution fines, since thats the value of the chips that never were recovered. --Bay City News/Shutterstock image",1

331,"Authorities say the man who threatened to kill riders on a Greyhound bus late Friday was in the U.S. illegally and had been deported to Mexico before. During a Saturday afternoon press conference at the Racine County Sheriffs substation, Sheriff Christopher Schmaling said that Margarito Vargas-Rosas, 33, was the person they believe threatened to kill fellow bus riders. Schmaling said Vargas-Rosas lives in Chicago and works in Milwaukee at a restaurant. About 40 Milwaukee Greyhound bus riders were safely evacuated just over the Illinois state line Friday night after authorities say Vargas-Rosas created a hostage situation as the bus traveled south on I-94. Sheriffs officials say they did not find a weapon, however are holding the bus in order to conduct a full search of the vehicle. The Sheriffs Office is recommending Vargas-Rosas be charged with making terroristic threats, and disorderly conduct. According to information released by Greyhound, a bus was en route from Milwaukee to Chicago when the incident began at about 9:50 p.m. According to media reports, the pursuit started on I-94 in Racine County just after 10 p.m. on a report that Vargas-Rosas was threatening to kill passengers. The Racine County Sheriff shut down both directions of I-94 late Friday as the bus drove south toward the Illinois state line. Multiple law enforcement vehicles could be seen pursuing the bus on an otherwise vacated freeway as Illinois state police prepared for a possible hostage situation. Illinois State Police said a disorderly and possibly armed man, later identified as Vargas-Rosas had been reported on the bus. The Greyhound coach from Milwaukee was reportedly stopped using spike strips near Route 173 and about 40 passengers were escorted off the bus. According to an Illinois Patch report, the Greyhound coach from Milwaukee was stopped near Route 173 and about 40 passengers were escorted off the bus. There were no reports of injuries. Authorities say Vargas-Rosas was taken into custody at that time. He is currently being held in the Lake County Jail. Drivers were advised to continue to avoid the area, as the highway remained closed for the investigation. Greyhound officials said that no injuries were reported, and that the bus company was fully cooperating with authorities as they were working to get the riders to safety.

334,"A man wearing body armor and armed with several guns was arrested Thursday night after a long standoff with police at a Parkland car dealership. The standoff ended when the Pierce County SWAT team closed in and shot the suspect. The incident began around 8 p.m. when Pierce County deputies responded to a call of a hostage situation at Sky Motors, 13401 Pacific Ave. South. The suspect had fled to the dealership after an attempted robbery at a nearby tire store. He was reportedly armed with handguns and rifles, which he used to fire shots at police gathered in the area. Police from Pierce County, Washington State Patrol, Lakewood, Tacoma, King County Sheriff, and the FBI all responded to the scene.

335,"On Thanksgiving, Troy Turner remembered his two children, Sarah, now 6, and Jacob, now 4, who were taken from their home more than two years ago by their mentally unstable mother. Where are you our precious babies? Please dont make us go through another Christmas without you. Please come home to your family. We need you and you need us. We love you, Turner posted on Facebook last weekend. The Clarksburg father has missed his youngsters last two birthdays and is gearing up for yet another court hearing on Dec. 12 to determine the mental competency of the childrens mother, Catherine Hoggle. She has said only that the youngsters are safe with someone — their father and Hoggles mother have begged her for answers, only to be met with silence. Despite over two years of treatment at a state mental hospital, Catherine, the mother responsible for the September 2014 disappearance of Sarah and Jacob was still not competent to stand trial at a fall hearing. A Montgomery County judge will not let police question the schizophrenic mom about what she did with the siblings. I am disappointed that the focus is not on Sarah and Jacob – on looking for them – regardless of any interview with my daughter, Lindsey Hoggle told Patch previously. I believe they are with someone, as she has indicated. Last week, Turner posted a request for supporters on the FindSarahFindJacob Facebook page to call or write Montgomery County Police Chief Thomas Manger. The grieving father wants police to engage the FBI.  Jacob was last seen with his mother on Sept. 7, 2014, in Darnestown or Clarksburg; Sarah was last seen with Hoggle on the morning of Sept. 8, 2014. Catherines family says she is paranoid and was making plans to leave the area, so she gave the young children to someone for safekeeping. On Sept. 12, 2014, Hoggle was found and arrested in Germantown. Police and prosecutors accuse the siblings mother of taking them from the family home in September 2014 and suspect she killed the youngsters. SEE ALSO: Lindsey Hoggle says the childrens case should involve the police departments missing persons unit; the Major Crimes Division took the lead in the investigation before Catherine was located. In reviewing all of the tips this spring, a Facebook friend who knew Catherine sent photos of what may have been Catherine at a playground in the Hamptons subdivision close to where she was found. The grandmother says she believes they are Catherine and Jacob, but is less sure about Sarah. If this is true, then she did not harm Sarah and Jacob initially as thought, Lindsey said. Legal Rulings, Frustration Mounts Judge Eugene Wolfe said in June 2016 that medical evaluations indicate that Catherine remained incompetent to stand trial on charges of neglect, obstruction and hindering in the case. Until she can face trial, the judge will not allow her to be interrogated about the fate of the children. Catherines rights shouldnt outweigh those of her children, says her longtime partner Troy Turner of Clarksburg, the father of Sarah and Jacob. I dont understand how you leave the victims out of the system. My kids have no representation in the courtroom. … Theres really no way to insert them in a case that should be all about them, he told Montgomery Community Media. The focus on the two missing children has been lost in the struggle over their mothers court-mandated commitment, which has stifled investigators, he said. The focus is simply bringing my kids home. Whether theyre alive or dead, they deserve to come home, and thats where the focus needs to remain. Wolfe set a new court status hearing for Sept. 27. »Find updates on the FindSarahFindJacobFacebook page. Hoggle is a schizophrenic who reportedly refused to stay on her medication. Turner has said in interviews and on social media that Catherine understands her situation based on conversations with her and that she should be questioned in court about the childrens fate. Police interviewed Catherine for more than 10 hours when she was first found, her mother said. While Lindsey spoke with her daughter several times a day for part of 2015, she has not seen her since Catherine fled home with the children. Isolation for any mental patient is unacceptable; there are ways to encourage family support and involvement without disclosing facts that she is not ready to share, Lindsey said. Turner has created the Change.org petition Justice for Sarah and Jacob as a way to push things forward and hopefully change the decisions made in the judicial system, he says. Sarah and Jacob Hoggle were taken by their mother, Catherine Hoggle, almost two years ago never to be seen again. She remains in an inpatient psychiatric facility where she is protected by patient rights, Turner says on the petition site. Police and other important officials are unable to question her as to the whereabouts of the children due to Judge Wolfes order. We are asking this order be lifted so we can finally bring our children home. On the petition, Turner calls Catherine a criminal who confessed to the childrens abduction. I also cant understand why a judge or any human being for that matter would do anything to obstruct their return (dead or alive they deserve to come home), Turner wrote. We are begging the court that this order be lifted so we can get closer to bring my children home. And while the legal battle goes on, Turner and supporters said last week that they will plan another search soon for signs of the children. A search in early April of Goshen Recreational Park in Germantown yielded nothing. The GoFundMe site has been established to pay for the costs tied to searches.

On Sept. 8, Hoggle left home with Sarah and told Turner she was taking the girl to a daycare center. That afternoon, when Turner asked about the childrens whereabouts, Hoggle would not tell him where the children were.

336,"- Two men and a woman were jailed Saturday morning, suspected of carjacking and kidnapping a woman then leading deputies on a chase from Calabasas to Woodland Hills. A deputy from the sheriffs Lost Hills Station pulled over a gray SUV for a traffic violation near Westward Way and Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu at 5:30 p.m. Friday, according to Deputy Trina Schrader of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department. As the deputy detained a passenger, he noticed drug paraphernalia inside the SUV and the driver fled, Schrader said. Near the scene of the initial stop, a citizen witnessed the suspects toss a black bag from the SUV. It was recovered by the citizen and turned over to deputies, who discovered it contained a handgun, Schrader said.Deputies later located the victim, who they believe was carjacked and kidnapped. She was not hurt, Schrader said. The SUV was located by deputies in a sheriffs helicopter in Calabasas and a deputy initiated a pursuit of the vehicle, which ended at 6:15 p.m. Friday near Burbank Boulevard and Canoga Avenue in Woodland Hills, Schrader said. Two suspects ran from the vehicle and were quickly apprehended. A third person was also taken into custody. --City News Service/Shutterstock image",1
337,"A parolee accused of shooting a Lancaster sheriffs sergeant who was responding to a burglary call and then firing four additional shots into the veteran lawman once he was down was charged today with capital murder. Trenton Trevon Lovell, 27, of Lancaster, appeared in court in connection with Wednesdays execution-style killing of Sgt. Steve Owen, but his arraignment was postponed until Nov. 14. The murder charge includes the special circumstance allegations of murder of a peace officer in the performance of his duties and murder for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest. Prosecutors will determine later whether to seek the death penalty against Lovell, who is being held without bail. Lovell is also charged with one count each of attempted murder involving another sheriffs deputy and possession of a firearm by a felon, along with two counts each of first-degree residential robbery and false imprisonment by violence -- the latter charge includes a knife use allegation. The attempted murder charge includes an allegation that he used a patrol car as a deadly and dangerous weapon against a second sheriffs employee who arrived at the scene. The criminal complaint also alleges that Lovell was on parole at the time of the crime and that he had been convicted of robbery as a juvenile in 2006 and again as an adult in 2009, according to Deputy District Attorney Michael Blake. Owen, 53, was shot to death as he responded to a young mothers 911 call reporting a burglary at her apartment building in the 3200 block of West Avenue J-7. Sheriff Jim McDonnell alleged Thursday that Lovell -- whose name the sheriff refused to utter -- shot Owen behind a residence after being confronted by the sergeant, who radioed that he had the suspect at gunpoint before he was shot. Sergeant Owen approached the suspect in response to a burglary call, McDonnell said. The suspect immediately shot Sergeant Owen. He then stood over and executed Sergeant Owen by firing four additional rounds into his body. He then unsuccessfully searched the body for the sergeants weapon with the intent to use it to murder the first responding deputy. The first responding deputy fired numerous times at Lovell, who had pointed his weapon at him, striking the suspect once in the shoulder, the sheriff said. Lovell allegedly jumped into the sergeants patrol vehicle while a second deputy arrived at the scene, then rammed the deputys vehicle with Owens patrol car. Not only did the suspect want to kill our deputies, he held two teenagers hostage in a neighboring house until they were rescued by the heroic efforts of our Special Enforcement Bureau and our Lancaster Station personnel, McDonnell said. The two teens were held at knifepoint, according to prosecutors. The gunman continued to try to escape and attempted to climb over a wall, but he was confronted by deputies and taken into custody, according to Deputy Juanita Navarro-Suarez, who added that a firearm was recovered at the scene. Owens wife, who is a sheriffs Arson-Explosives detective, made it to the hospital before her husband died, according to sheriffs Executive Officer Neal Tyler. One of Owens adult sons and his stepdaughter, as well his mother, also were at his bedside, Tyler said. Owens was a 29-year department veteran who had worked in the Antelope Valley for years and was known for his community involvement, especially with area youths. He was promoted to sergeant five years ago. Owen received a Meritorious Conduct Medal in 2014, along with five of his Lancaster Station colleagues, for their roles in a pursuit and carjacking that ended with the capture of the armed suspect and the motorists rescue. Lancaster Mayor R. Rex Parris announced today that he will ask the city council to rename Lancaster Community Park as Sergeant Steve Owen Community Park. He deserves to always be remembered by the residents of the city of Lancaster and the Antelope Valley, the mayor said. Renaming our community park after a true hero is one small step in that direction. Steve was killed in the line of duty protecting a community in which he was deeply embedded. Sergeant Steve Owen was one of the best-known deputies throughout the entire Antelope Valley region. Owens alleged killer has been arrested 11 times, first as a juvenile on suspicion of selling marijuana, and was jailed or imprisoned twice, according to the sheriff. McDonnell said he believed the death penalty would be an appropriate sentence if Lovell is convicted of murdering Owen. The same sentence was handed down in 2007 to gang member Jose Luis Orozco, who was convicted of murdering Deputy Jerry Ortiz on June 24, 2005, in Hawaiian Gardens as he was investigating a shooting that had occurred four days earlier. Jurors in that case also found true the special circumstance allegations of murder of a peace officer, murder to avoid arrest and murder while lying in wait. His automatic appeal is still pending.

339,"According to statewide statistics, there are more than 32,000 children in Wisconsin who are homeschooled — a group in population equivalent to the entire city of Menomonee Falls. As the vast majority of parents seek to educate their children outside of public school districts or private schools, some child advocates say that a small number of people take advantage of generous homeschool laws — including those in Wisconsin — leading to children who are out of sight, out of mind, and who end up suffering abuses. They Are Not Alone Sixteen-year-old Natalie Finn died from starvation on Oct. 24, 2016, after her mother locked her, a 15-year-old brother and a 14-year-old sister in their bedroom for months, food and water all but cut off. One of the kids who survived, barely, later said their bedroom slowly filled with their own waste because their mother often would not let them out even to use the bathroom. When they did get permission, they were so desperately thirsty they sometimes scooped water into their mouths from the toilet bowl. These damaged children in West Des Moines, Iowa, were not alone. There are scores of cases like this one involving starving kids to death. Other cases document children who have been beaten by parents most of their young lives or have otherwise been treated so severely for so long they can rightly be classified as torture victims. Related Reading: Homeschool Child Abuse in Wisconsin - Case List In one sense, the savage abuse inflicted on the Finn kids and in hundreds of other cases, including some in Wisconsin, is easily explained by the one thing they had in common: They were homeschooled. Its really hard to starve a child to death when that kids in school, said Rachel Coleman, co-founder and research director of the Coalition for Responsible Home Education, which is pushing for regulations to protect homeschooled kids. The group does not oppose parents teaching their children at home but it wants to prevent abusive parents from so easily making their kids invisible. From 2000 to last year, at least 320 homeschooled children were severely neglected and abused, often for years without detection, according to the Homeschoolings Invisible Children database kept by Colemans organization. Of those kids, 116 died. A disproportionate number of the children were adopted from foster care and the database indicates homeschooled kids die from abuse at a great rate than other children. Nobody sees these kids. Without any oversight, there is nothing to ensure a child is receiving an education or is seen by mandatory reporters, Coleman said. Homeschooling parents could lock a child up and no one would ever know. Think about it: Lax oversight provides a shield far more effective than anything some parents could ever devise on their own to to lock up their children and hide their torture and abuse. Along with starvation, physical torture and medical neglect, totally isolating kids from any contact with the outside world is a common form of parental abuse. Oversight of homeschooling in some states is non-existent. In most states, oversight is weak, at best. Nowhere in the United States do homeschool laws require welfare checks on the children involved to ensure they arent being abused or tortured. The most they require are academic assessments, either by parents or a certified teacher. Only a few states require those assessments be done by someone outside the home. All but two states allow convicted child abusers and other criminals to homeschool their kids. Calls to strengthen homeschooling regulations have come and gone over the years, with the net result actually being a weakening of oversight. Advocates for reform, though, have become as optimistic as they have been for years in large part because of the emergence of a group that had long been muted: former homeschooled students themselves. Coleman from the home education coalition was homeschooled. Ryan Stollar the co-founder of Homeschool Alumni Reaching Out, was a homeschooler, too. When homeschooling is done responsibly, it can be amazing, the group says on its website. What we oppose is irresponsible homeschooling, where the educational method is used to create or hide abuse, isolation, and neglect. Coleman and Stollar have attracted other former students who want reform and have quickly surged in status not only as leaders of reform efforts but also as credible voices that can gain the support of all but the most hard-core oversight opponents. The most extreme anti-oversight groups oppose any form of government involvement in homeschooling and they always will. Coleman and Stollar have changed the tone from previous reformers to appeal to less ideological homeschoolers, positioning themselves not as hostile outsiders but as pragmatic insiders pusing for reasonable child protections that would never face opposition in any context outside of homeschooling. The Responsible Education coalitions creation of a database details in graphic language hundreds of gruesome abuse cases involving homeschooled kids. Homeschooling can serve as a powerful tool in the hand of an abusive parent, according to the sister group that maintains the database, Homeschools Invisible Children. Numerous young adults who were homeschooled for part of their upbringing and attended public school for part of their upbringing have reported that their parents abuse was worse when they were homeschooled, as there was nothing to act as a check on their parents abuse. Among other measures the coalition has called for: Only Pennsylvania and Arkansas currently forbid homeschooling of kids whose parents have been convicted of child abuse and certain other crimes. Some states require none of the coalitions proposals. No state requires all of the measures. Abuse In Wisconsin While most homeschooling parents provide warm, nurturing environments for their children, University of Wisconsin pediatrician Barbara Knox found in a 2014 study on child torture that in 38 cases of severe child abuse, 47 percent of parents had either never enrolled or pulled their kids out of public schools when abuse was suspected. Her findings were based on reviews of only a small number of cases and while not statistically relevant, she identified the same pattern of abused homeschooled kids as the responsible home education coalition. Knoxs review also found the abused homeschool children received no true educational efforts, and the isolation was accompanied by an escalation of physically abusive events.  In one case in Wisconsin from Nov. 2016, a local school district notified child protective services after noting that a 10-year-old girl was not being legally homeschooled. Anna Marie Lloyd, 48, of Juneau, was ultimately found guilty of child abuse after investigators learned that she had been neglecting and abusing children in her custody. According to reports, Lloyd moved to Wisconsin from Oklahoma in 2016 with her 17-year-old son, 10-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old. Reports indicated the 10-year-old was not registered as a homeschooler. Lloyd claimed she was homeschooling her despite the fact that she could not read, write or count and would have used a computer program for homeschooling but did not know the password. According to a criminal complaint filed in Wisconsin, Lloyd frequently punched the 10-year-old and the 2-year-old in the head, and stated that she was aware another one of her sons had sexual contact with the girl, saying the child was fine with it. She also encouraged the girl to smoke marijuana.  Under Wisconsin law, homeschooling requirements include filing annually with the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and provide 875 hours of instruction in a sequentially progressive curriculum of fundamental instruction in reading, language arts, math, social studies, science and health. According to documentation, there are no parent qualification, bookkeeping, or assessment requirements. State law does not give either the Department of Public Instruction or local districts the authority to monitor home schooling to ensure that they are meeting their requirements. In the event of a complaint, the local superintendent may ask the homeschool parents to provide evidence that theyre following the law. About 1.7 million children in the United States — or about 3.3 percent of kids — are homeschooled, including about 32,866 in Wisconsin, according to estimates from the National Center for Education Statistics. Sabrina Rays brief, tortured life is another glaring example. At 16 years old, Sabrina weighed only 56 pounds when paramedics were called to her home last May in Perry, Iowa. She had often been so hungry that she ate what she could find rummaging through garbage cans. Police said that sometime after April 15, Sabrinas adult brother drop-kicked her down a basement staircase. She lay for days on the basement floor in excruciating pain, police said, unable to move until her emaciated body finally gave up. Like Natalie Finns mother, Sabrinas adoptive parents had previous involvement with child protection workers. Under reforms pushed by advocates for tighter homeschooling regulations, once the parents removed Sabrina from school, they would have faced close monitoring. Instead, the law allowed Sabrinas parents to make their daughter, and signs of her abuse, invisible. So was Liam Roberts, a 6-year-old boy in Jerseyville, Illinois. He dropped off the radar of adults who might have saved him two years ago after his father and stepmother, Michael and Georgena Roberts, were investigated by child protective services caseworkers for inadequate food in the home. Soon after, they began homeschooling Liam and his siblings. Liam died last week of extreme malnutrition. He weighed only 17 pounds, about a third the weight of a typical 6-year-old. Except in Pennsylvania, homeschool laws allow even parents who have been convicted of crimes like sexual assault or child abuse to hide their children from public view. A lack of oversight in California is what helped make the 13 children of David Allen Turpin and Louise Anna Turpin invisible to their Riverside neighbors . The children, ages 2 to 29, were rescued in January after a 17-year-old escaped their house and called authorities. When police arrived at the home, they found ropes, chains and padlocks used to restrain and shackle the Turpin siblings to their beds. They were dirty and a putrid odor permeated the house. Investigators said parents had imprisoned their children for years. The adult children were so malnourished they looked like children. What happened to these poor souls has been a sadly familiar story to Coleman since the founding of the Coalition for Responsible Home Education. This was not new to us, said Coleman, whose organization keeps a database called Homeschoolings Invisible Children listing the names of hundreds of home-educated children who have been tortured and abused by their parents. The isolation and food deprivation, none of that was surprising. Its not even the first case of 13 children, but a photo with all the girls dressed the same created a moment of virality. The case drew increased scrutiny of homeschooling oversight, but Coleman believes the enormity of the problem has been understated. Her organizations Invisible Children database surely does not include every severely abused homeschooled kid or every child who died at the hands of their parents because no one knows where — or if — many kids are supposedly being schooled. HOMESCHOOLING NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD Of course, kids who attend public schools are often abused, too. Homeschooling has both advocates and critics, and many good parents whose children dont thrive in traditional classroom see it as a valuable option. Coleman is one of them. Her mother required standardized testing every three years, provided outlines of the curriculum to school officials and maintained a portfolio of Colemans academic achievements — part of keeping a good record, she said. At-home educations are neither good nor bad, said Coleman, whose doctoral candidacy in history at the University of Indiana represents a level of academic achievement not uncommon among homeschoolers. But in the hands of abusive parents, she said, homeschooling can lead to horrific abuse situations. Iowa opened the door for abuse five years ago when it sliced homeschooling regulations to almost nothing. Before the changes, Iowas homeschooling laws were among the most thorough in the country. State Sen. Matt said McCoy, who conducted an inquiry into Natalies and Sabrinas deaths, said that in some cases in which children are adopted from foster care, as the two girls were, home education is a complete ruse. Sabrina, for example, was not educated at home but rather worked at her parents Rays of Sunshine Daycare in Perry. McCoy called it slavery. HOMESCHOOL LAW REFORM EFFORTS McCoy is working on legislation to prevent parents from using homeschooling simply to hide their abuse. He wants mandatory annual physicals and dental checkups for the kids and a requirement that they be checked on by public school monitors every three months. Once we lose them in the system, no one knows what happens to them, he said. In California, Assemblyman Jose Medina, a Democrat whose district includes the area where the 13 Turpin children lived, said hes extremely concerned about the lack of oversight and is considering legislation to prevent a situation like this from occurring in the future. Lawmakers in several other states are rethinking the lack of oversight in homeschooling situations, too, but even modest reporting proposals have been killed over the years by the powerful homeschooling lobby. In fact, when homeschooling began to catch on in the 1980s, it faced significant government resistance. The practice was banned outright in some states and heavily regulated in others. Since then, homeschoolings lobby, led by the Home School Legal Defense Association, has led the charge for full parental control over their childrens education, in the process managing to weaken oversight considerably. The defense association, a creation of the religious right, has opposed states merely requiring that school districts be notified that kids being homeschooled arent attending public school not because their truant but because they are being taught at home. Beyond that, the defense association has been increasingly involved in defending homeschool parents accused of abuse and has worked to make investigations by Child Protective Services more difficult. To its homeschooling members who are approached by social workers, the association has advised: Never let the social worker in your house without a warrant or court order. All the cases that you have heard about where children are snatched from the home usually involve families waiving their Fourth Amendment right to be free from such searches and seizures by agreeing to allow the social worker to come inside the home. A warrant requires probable cause which does not include an anonymous tip or a mere suspicion.

A man and woman were sleeping aboard one of the boats, described as up to 40-footers, and the woman suffered a minor cut to the forehead while escaping the sinking craft. It actually came in as a water rescue call, said KFD acting Battalion Chief Dana Olson. Apparently they had been sleeping aboard and went into the water trying to escape.The woman did not need to be taken to the hospital. Shell be seeking her own treatment, Olson said. Our crews examined them and kept them warm in an aid car.Olson said the winds and waves were too severe when firefighters arrived, at about 5:45 a.m. The boats looked intact, but theyre partially submerged, he said. Theyre some pretty big boats. I would say 40 feet.Three boats were at the marina. No one was aboard the other boat that sank. One of the sunken craft somehow lost part of its transom, the back part of the boat.Exactly how the two boats sank is not certain.Im guessing they probably took on water because of the wind and waves, Olson said.The marina is in downtown Kirkland at 25 Lakeshore Plaza, part of Marina Park.Seven Kirkland Fire Department crews responded to the call, including two aid cars and a ladder truck.",0

342,"The duo suspected of committing a string of daytime door kick-in burglaries throughout Howard County may be on the lam after failing to appear at a bail hearing on Nov. 15 in Howard County Circuit Court. The suspects, Joseph Leo Baumgarten, of Pasadena, and Dianna Lynn Marketti, of Dundalk, were arrested by Howard County Police on Oct. 4 and charged with stealing more than $22,000 in firearms, jewelry and electronics from four Howard County residences, but later released the next day on $15,000 bail. Howard County Police said the duo is suspected in 10 more burglaries that they havent yet been charged in. The Nov. 15 hearing was scheduled to adjust their bail, but neither appeared, according to assistant states attorney Natasha Byus. Appropriate bond hopefully prevents [this situation] from people who have a history of failing to appear or have violated probation or parole in the past, said Byus. About a week after they were released on bail, Baumgarten, 40, allegedly assaulted and kidnapped Marketti, 30, in the process of stealing her vehicle, according to a Baltimore County police report filed in court documents. According to police, on Oct. 13 Baumgarten, of Pasadena, allegedly broke into Markettis home in Dundalk around 7 a.m., went to her bedroom, stole the keys to her Chrysler PT Cruiser and fought with Marketti, according to the police report. After that, Baumgarten left and got into Markettis car as Marketti continued to argue with him, at which point Baumgarten allegedly pulled Marketti by her hair into the car and drove away. Marketti told police Baumgarten repeatedly punched her in the face while in the car. Eventually Baumgarten stopped the car and Marketti escaped, but Baumgarten followed her into woods near Sparrows Point Country Club in Baltimore, caught up with her, dragged her by her feet farther into the woods and then left the scene in her PT Cruiser, according to the report. Marketti told police that Baumgarten was her ex-boyfriend, who she had broken up with the week before the assualt. Police reported finding visible injuries, including lacerations and abrasions on Markettis face and hands. Baltimore County police did not comment on the investigation into the assualt and kidnapping on Monday. The release of the suspected burglars made waves in Howard County, with commenters on Patch asking why the bail was set so low for the two. In addition to the suspected burglaries, Baumgarten had violated his probation five times previously after being convicted of burglary for three offenses from 1996, one from 2002 and another from 2008, according to court documents. In addition, he failed to appear in court for traffic offenses on five occasions. Marketti currently has 15 active traffic cases, most of which are for driving on a suspended license, with one as recent as Sept. 26. Howard County District Court commissioner Oreon W. Pinkston II set the original bail on Oct. 5 and the suspects quickly posted it, according to court documents. The court commissioners office declined to comment after the bail was set. A request for comment to a state justice department spokesperson on Monday afternoon about the latest developments in the case—suspects failure to appear for the bond hearing, Baumgartens alleged assault of Marketti—was not immediately responded to on Monday.

357,"NEWPORT BEACH, CA A search was continuing today for a domestic violence suspect who escaped after leading authorities on a chase that ended in Newport Beach with an hours-long standoff and a dash to safety by the mans estranged wife and children. Newport Beach police, assisted by California Highway Patrol officers, were searching for Thomas Ueno, who abandoned his SUV near Dover Drive and 16th Street in Newport Beach and ran off, according to Newport Beach police. Ueno originally was wanted in connection with a domestic violence case, but once he refused to pull over for law enforcement authorities, he became a kidnapping suspect, said CHP Officer Denise Quesada. Residents were urged to call police if they see the suspect, described as Hispanic, about 35 years old, with tattoos on both sides of his neck. He was wearing jeans, a black hoodie, and gray shoes when last seen, according to police. The chase began at 4:47 p.m. Monday in Buena Park when that citys police department was contacted by its counterpart in Huntington Park, which feared a domestic violence situation had developed. The man is believed to have had his estranged wife and two children with him in the vehicle. Police said they were concerned the driver was armed. Authorities chased the mans Hummer on streets and freeways. On surface streets, the driver was reckless, once driving the wrong way. On freeways, he drove carefully, according to media reports. Much of the chase north from Los Angeles County was on the Santa Ana (5) Freeway. The suspect stopped at Pacific Coast Highway and Jamboree Road in Newport Beach after being followed over a number of Orange County freeways. The suspect resumed driving, finally stopping at Dover and 16th Street in Newport Beach, near Newport Harbor High School. Dover was closed in both directions by Newport Beach police. The driver stopped there and a standoff began. Around 10 p.m. Monday, the woman and children ran from the vehicle to police. News footage showed the suspect exiting the Hummer and fleeing on foot.

A Good Samaritan emerged in the form of an employee at a nearby pawn shop, holding Cervantes down until police arrived, according to the affidavit. Once police arrived to detain him, Carvantes is said to have confessed to trying to rape the woman, telling police the devil made him do it, according to the affidavit.

360,"A man was convicted Tuesday of the kidnap-murder of a Palm Desert resident who was slain at an Indio drug den, then left bound inside his burning SUV. Andrew John Muir, 29, faces life in prison without the possibility of parole for the killing of 38-year-old Jason Cupit. Prosecutors said the victim was stabbed in the back at an Indio home frequented by Muir prior to being left -- handcuffed -- inside his own vehicle, which was found ablaze off Vista Del Norte in Coachella on Aug. 14, 2015. Jurors deliberated for about one day before returning their verdict on murder, kidnapping and arson counts, and also found true a special circumstance allegation of committing the murder in the commission of a felony. A sentencing date was not immediately set. Deputy District Attorney Anthony Orlando told the jury that Muir brought Cupit to the Indio home, where they bought drugs, and then a day after Cupits death, offered to buy gas and food for several people with the victims credit card, which was used at two area gas stations and at a Jack in the Box restaurant. Orlando said the evidence against Muir was circumstantial, but pointed to him as Cupits killer. Muirs body was found handcuffed inside his burning Toyota Rav4 just before 4 a.m. An autopsy showed he was burned over more than 75 percent of his body, but died of a stab wound to the back and also suffered blunt force trauma before the fire. Defense attorney John Dolan said Muir took part only in burning the victims car. He alleged that Cupit was killed by the men who lived at the home, including a now-deceased drug dealer and other addicts. Dolan said the only evidence linking his client to Cupits death was the word of unreliable witnesses, one of whom told investigators that Muir said Cupit was acting sheisty and that he killed that guy. The witness also told investigators that he saw Muir speeding off from the home in Cupits SUV, while a person in the cargo area was seen popping up once or twice as the vehicle was departing. Dolan said that no one else could corroborate the claims of the witness, who he suggested may have been involved in Cupits death. He made up a story, Dolan alleged, because he knew when the cops came, the jig was up. He was in trouble. He needed to deflect away from himself so hes going to deflect to Mr. Muir. Muir, who was arrested on Sept. 8 at the Arabia Mobile Home Park in Indio, told investigators that he found Cupit lying on the floor of the Indio home. He admitted dragging Cupit into the victims Rav4, which he wiped down at another location, and also told investigators that he stole a can of gasoline, parked the SUV and left the gas can inside before walking away, according to the prosecution. At the Indio home, investigators found Cupits blood on the floor and ceiling of the living room and in two bedrooms. An aluminum baseball bat used to beat Cupit was also found, along with a crowbar that Dolan said was likely used to strike the victim. A forensic pathologist testified that Cupits wound was caused by a knife, but Dolan said no knife was located or could be linked to Muir. He also argued that no fingerprints or DNA from his client were found inside the home or on the bat or crowbar. — By City News Service / Image via Shutterstock",0

363,"Lauren Brown made several demands during the recent Suwanee SWAT standoff with Gwinnett Police, but his desired outcome was obvious to one of his hostages. My personal opinion, Tim Hollingsworth said Tuesday, was that he wanted to board up the house, kill us, set the house on fire, and then let the fire department come in and put out the fire. He wanted so bad to see it on TV. Hollingsworth and the four other Gwinnett Fire and Emergency Services officers discussed the incident publicly for the first time at fire department headquarters Tuesday (April 16). The other fire officers were Jody Moss, Jason Schuon, Chip Echols and Sydney Garner. Brown, who lived at 2440 Walnut Grove Way, was shot to death in a gunfire exchange with a Gwinnett Police SWAT officer April 10. That officer, who since has been released from the hospital, was identified as Sgt. Jason Teague. Browns possible desire to see the incident on television was not lost on Schuon, who quickly undid the cable box at the house. Genius, was how Gwinnett Police Cpl. Jake Smith described that move. Smith, who was at the news conference, added Tuesday that Brown fired six shots when SWAT officers entered the house. Teague, the Gwinnett officer, fired about 15. Brown did not take long to reveal that his 911 call was a ruse. Now for the real reason youre here, he told the firefighters. He pulled a revolver on them, and pulled back bed covers to reveal two more handguns. Later in the ordeal, he produced two more WWII-era weapons from his closet. He made his hostages take off their shirts, to show him they were not armed. He said (the ordeal) would turn out exactly the way he envisioned it. Early on, Hollingsworth suggested that he brew a pot of coffee, as a mood lightener. There were coffee grounds all over -- I was shaking. -- Check Suwanee Patch for updates to this story",0

365,"Two brothers who were convicted of kidnapping and human trafficking for trying to force a woman to engage in prostitution for them in Oakland were sentenced to lengthy state prison terms today. Samuel Asa Wynn, 39, who prosecutors said was the more active participant in the crime, was sentenced by Alameda County Superior Court Judge C. Don Clay to life in prison and Lewis Asa Wynn, 38, was sentenced to 21 years. Prosecutors said the victim, known in court as Jane Doe, was working as a prostitute in the area of 18th Avenue and International Boulevard in Oakland on July 10, 2015, when the Wynn brothers approached her. They said the brothers asked her, Wheres your pimp at? and told her they needed new girls to work for them but Jane Doe refused their offer and they left. But a few minutes later, the Wynn brothers pulled up to Jane Doe in their vehicle and Samuel Wynn grabbed her and physically forced her into the back seat of the car, prosecutors said. The woman screamed loudly for help and physically resisted but she was physically overpowered by Samuel Wynn, according to the district attorneys office. A neighbor heard Jane Doe screaming and called 911 to report the kidnapping, prosecutors said. Inside the car, the Wynn brothers told the woman they were going to sexually assault her and then force her to engage in acts of prostitution at the Comfort Inn in East Oakland, according to the district attorneys office. Fortunately for Jane Doe, Oakland police officers spotted the car that matched the witness description within 15 minutes, before she was forced into performing any sexual acts, and they safely stopped the vehicle and apprehended the Wynn brothers, authorities said. Prosecutor Allyson Donovan said Samuel Wynn got the longer sentence because he masterminded the crime and he had more serious prior felony convictions, although Lewis Wynn has also been convicted of felonies in the past. Donovan asked that Lewis Wynn be sentenced to 50 years because she thinks he was an active participant in the crime, even though his brother was the lead aggressor. However, Clay said a 21-year term would be more appropriate. Before he was sentenced, Lewis Wynn complained that he was being railroaded and said he was only a minor participant in what his brother did. Lewis Wynn said Jane Doe had opportunities to get out of the car that night and claimed, I never stopped her from getting out of the car. He accused the woman of engaging in perjury and said, Im not a pimp and Ive never accepted money from a prostitute in my life. Donovan said Lewis Wynns comments indicate he has a refusal to accept responsibility and said it is absolutely offensive for him to slander Jane Doe. The Wynn brothers family members quietly sobbed during their sentencing hearing. A bailiff escorted Donovan back to her office after the hearing because the Wynn family has made threatening comments to her in the past. After the hearing, Donovan said that even though the victim was already working as a prostitute, she didnt deserve to be kidnapped and forced into committing acts of prostitution for others. She said jail authorities tape-recorded a call in which Samuel Wynn told a friend that because the woman was a prostitute no one would believe her and he wouldnt be convicted. — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock",1
366,"Oklahoma prosecutors will seek the death penalty for a Texas man suspected in the cold-case killings of two women and two girls 20 years ago, and criminal experts and law enforcement officials say he fits the profile of a serial killer because he chose his victims by gender and age, and gained pleasure from exerting control over them before they died. William Lewis Reece, 58, is charged in the deaths of 19-year-old Tiffany Johnston, 17-year-old Jessica Cain and 12-year-old Laura Smither. Reece also is suspected, but not charged, in the death of 20-year-old Kelli Cox, whose remains were discovered outside Houston and identified last year. Reece was already serving a 60-year prison sentence in Texas for kidnapping when he led police to graves where Cain and Coxs remains were found. (For more information on this and other neighborhood stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) All four victims disappeared over a four-month period in 1997. Johnston was from Oklahoma, while the three others were from Texas. Oklahoma prosecutors announced Thursday they would seek the death penalty in the Johnston killing, and Reece has pleaded not guilty. He faces two more counts of murder in Galveston County, southeast of Houston, but authorities say those charges in Texas are on hold pending the outcome of Reeces Oklahoma trial. Galveston County District Attorney Jack Roady declined to comment on Reeces case Friday, but described Reece as a serial killer because his actions were truly horrific. Catherine Hammarsten, Reeces attorney in the Oklahoma case, did not return a call seeking comment Friday. Joseph Cillo, a professor of criminal justice at St. Leo University in Florida, said Friday that Reece fits the profile of a serial killer because he apparently followed a pattern of choosing young females and left behind little evidence. Serial killers are generally known as pattern killers, said Cillo, who is teaching a class on mass murderers and serial killers. If Reece has (killed) four young females, it makes it a pattern. I would assure you this guy had a sexual connection with the deaths, he said. Reece worked construction and took jobs in the Houston area and Oklahoma, according to Kathryn Casey, author of the 2015 book, Deliver Us: Three Decades of Murder and Redemption in the Infamous I-45/Texas Killing Fields. He was imprisoned in Oklahoma for a decade for sexually assaulting two women and then moved to Houston when he was released because a sister lived there, she said. He was out of prison for one year, from October 1996 to October 1997, and during that time hes been linked to four different murders, said Casey, who labeled Reece a serial sexual predator. Cillo said it took years for authorities to link Reece to the killings because serial killers are very good at one thing: they dont generally leave a lot of evidence behind. Johnstons body was found a day after she disappeared in Yukon, Oklahoma, while Coxs remains were found last year in a pasture near Houston after Reece led investigators to the spot.  But even that action of leading authorities to the site is one of the hallmarks of a serial killer, Cillo said. He took them to his trophies; each one of these victims is a trophy, Cillo said. You would be amazed that many serial killers visit the site where the bodies have been buried or dumped many times because it brings back a connection. Kathy Dobry, the mother of Tiffany Johnston, said the years have brought endless frustration as the investigation into her daughters death stalled. I pushed every year on Tiffanys anniversary that something needs to be done, and we finally got something done, said Dobry, who credited new leadership at the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation in the search for her daughters killer. New DNA testing resulted in a partial match that led investigators to Reece, she said.

367,"A man who police say repeatedly fired shots into the air with an assault rifle and refused to comply with officers orders was killed by police in the courtyard of a northwest Austin church early Saturday morning, Assistant Chief Chris McIlvain told reporters at a press conference. According to police, authorities first responded to 10401 Anderson Mill Road for a panic robbery alarm around 1:08 a.m. A few minutes later police received a call that two men were physically fighting in the parking lot of the establishment. Police say the suspect was described as a white male between 40-45 years old who was armed with a gun. When officers arrived at the scene the suspect had departed but had left his gun behind, which police recovered. Around 1:36 a.m., police received a call saying the man had returned to the scene and was now armed with a shotgun and an AR-15. An officer who was still in the area from the previous call made his way back and while waiting for backup saw the suspect in the parking lot of the establishment and and then saw him aim the assault rifle in the air and fire five to six shots. Additional officers arrived and gave the suspect orders to drop the weapon, which he refused and began walking southbound towards a church that was behind the establishment, police said. After making his way on to the property of the church he fired more shots in the air. Officers set up a team to contain the suspect in the courtyard of the church. Officers then began a dialogue with the suspect who was semi-barricaded behind a retaining wall. After talking for about 13 minutes, the suspect refused to comply. He left the barricaded area around 2:03 a.m. and began walking through the courtyard, police said. SWAT and hostage negotiators had not yet arrived on the scene when the suspect walked through the courtyard. According to police, at this point, officers encountered the subject and fired on him. Officers began life-saving measured on the suspect but he was pronounced deceased. McIlvain said it appears that at this time only one officer fired on the suspect. The officer has not been named and will be placed on administrative duty. The man killed in the shooting has not been identified. Image via Shutterstock",0

370,"SPRINGFIELD GARDENS, QUEENS — A murder suspect accused of raping and trying to kill a woman in North Hollywood reportedly told police hes killed at least six others, including a Queens nurse he met on Tinder. Danueal Drayton, 27, of New Haven, Connecticut, is expected to appear in court Monday on charges that he sexually assaulted and attempted to murder a 28-year-old woman after they went on a date and headed back to her North Hollywood apartment, police said. Police arrived at the apartment on July 26 to arrest Drayton for the murder of Samantha Stewart, a 29-year-old nurse found strangled to death in her Springfield Gardens apartment on July 17. By the time they found him, he was holding the other woman hostage, authorities said. The New York Daily News reported Drayton confessed to murdering two others in Connecticut, one in the Bronx, one in Suffolk County, one in either Queens or Nassau County, and possibly another in California. My body did this, not my mind, Drayton told investigators, according to the Daily News. I didnt want to do this. My body made me do this. It was unclear if Drayton was telling the truth about the additional crimes, a police source said. Authorities said Drayton likely preyed on women he met through online dating sites. Though Drayton was originally wanted for the murder of Stewart, whose lifeless body was found by her brother and father, hes now believed to be behind the rape of another Queens woman just a month before Stewart was killed, police said. Authorities said he seemed to be repeating a pattern of rape and strangulation seen in Stewarts murder in the North Hollywood attack before officers intervened . The Daily News also reported that Drayton was released by authorities at a July 5 hearing in Nassau County after he was arrested for choking his girlfriend in Inwood Park. A judge ruled that Drayton posed no flight risk and rejected the county district attorneys call to hold him on $7,500 bail. It would have been impossible for the judge at that time to foresee the allegations that are presently unfolding and coming to light, a Nassau Court spokesman told the Daily News. But Drayton had several other brushes with the law, several of which resulted in stints in Connecticut prisons over the last few years. Drayton was sentenced to three years in prison after a 2011 strangulation arrest in East Haven and ordered to serve another two years for unlawful restraint and violating a protective order in 2012, court records show. He was again sentenced to two more years in prison for violating a protective order in Waterbury in 2015 and most recently served three months in jail after a February arrest for harassment in New Haven. In his latest arrest, Drayton was charged with attempted murder, forcible rape, false imprisonment by violence and sexual penetration by a foreign object. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison. Drayton was supposed to be arraigned on the charge Friday, but he refused to board a bus meant to take him to court, according to ABC7. If he refuses to voluntarily appear for his rescheduled arraignment Monday, a court order will be issued to force him to appear.

The alleged attack was so brazen, Los Angeles Police detectives think this may not be his first time attacking a woman. At about 3 a.m. Friday, Spence picked up a 24-year-old woman who asked to be taken from Downtown LA to Hollywood, according to police. The woman passed out in his car, and Spence drove her to a motel on Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood, according to Capt. William Hayes, commanding officer of the LAPDs Robbery- Homicide Division. He went to the hotel, rented a room and then carried her from his car into the hotel room where he assaulted her, Hayes said. To do something that brazen ... in my investigators and my opinion ... we believe it is something he has done before ... The woman, who may have passed out from drinking alcohol, woke up alone, not knowing where she was or how she got there, and called police, Hayes said at a news conference Monday afternoon at LAPD headquarters. Detectives arrested Spence later that day at around 9:15 p.m. on suspicion of kidnapping to commit a sex crime. They served a search warrant at Spences home and collected evidence, police said.

378,"Editors note: Patchs Unsolved Cases generally feature cases from southwestern Pennsylvania. On a trip this summer, I passed right by the small town of Tyrone, just north of Altoona. Tyrone, to me, has always meant Kathy Shea. Her face, which appeared in newspapers and on TV at the time of her 1965 disappearance, has haunted me since I was a child because she was just a few years younger than me. As I looked over at Tyrone from the new highway, I knew I had to share her story. Its a tale thats happened too many times—a young girl on her way to or from school vanishes into thin air. And that is the story of Kathleen Ann Shea of Tyrone, PA, who was 6 years old when she disappeared on March 18, 1965. She was last seen traveling north between 15th and 16th streets, walking from her home to Adams Elementary School—about four blocks away. Kathy was last seen splashing in rain puddles on her way to school, according to a 2010 story in the Altoona Mirror. Along the way, the story says, a crossing guard helped her across 15th Street, and she spoke to a woman who was watching from her North Avenue home to make sure her own daughter reached the school safely. Hours passed before anyone realized Kathy was missing. The kindergarten teacher thought Kathy was out sick, and her mother thought she was at school,  according to the Mirror. What makes Kathys case disturbing is that it happened in a small, central Pennsylvania town, a place where people felt safe. According to The Doe Network website, talk of Kathy still generates a lot of interest in the area around Tyrone. Despite the best efforts of local and state police, no trace of Kathy has ever been found. Law enforcement officials checked out many leads, all with negative results. Her disappearance is considered a non-family abduction. At the time of her disappearance, Kathy was only 3 feet 11 inches tall and weighed just 47 pounds. She is described as having blue eyes and brown hair. Kathy was last seen wearing a brown hat, beige coat with a fur collar, red gloves, red-knit sweater, brown jumper, red tights and yellow boots with black soles. She would be 53 years old today. Her parents, Mary Alice and James Shea, never gave up hope before their deaths in 1997 and 2006, respectively. Anyone with information about Kathys disappearance or whereabouts is asked to contact Trooper Aungst, Pennsylvania State Police, at 814-696-6100.

379,"One of the two powerboats that collided in a fatal crash during the Point Pleasant Beach Offshore Grand Prix has been located in 35 feet of water near where it sank in the May 21 accident, according to nj.com. The 26-foot Smith Brothers boat was found off Johnson Street in Bay Head, south of where it collided with the Repeat Offender, shortly after the race began, Mayor Stephen Reid said. Divers from the Berkeley Township Search and Rescue Dive Team have volunteered to help locate the boat for more than a week. New Jersey State Police Boats are also on the scene to assist. Investigators are trying to determine why the other boat — Repeat Offender — crossed in front of the Smith Brothers boat, which caused it to run over the top of the Repeat Offender, Al Della Fave, a spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutors Office has said. The throttle man for the Repeat Offender, David Raabe, 38, of Forked River, was killed. The driver, James JP Byrne, 35, of Nutley, was seriously injured. A New Jersey State Police boat was in the ocean off Bay Head last week on Tuesday using what appeared to be side-scan sonar during the search. The transom of the Smith Brothers was ripped off during the collision and sank, Reid has said. Its two occupants, brothers Rich and Pete Smith, were thrown into the ocean but were rescued. They refused medical attention. The Prosecutors Office said in a statement recently that the Repeat Offender was at fault after a preliminary investigation. But its unclear why the Repeat Offender turned directly in front of the Smith Brothers. The Smith Brothers, operated by Peter Smith, 50, Riverton, and his brother Richard Smith, 53, of Souderton, Pennsylvania, who was at the throttle, struck Repeat Offender while in a turn, Della Fave has said. Both Raabe and Byrne were stuck by the hull of the Smith Brothers boat as it passed over the top of them. Both men were wearing full helmets. Raabe sustained serious head injuries and was pronounced dead at 1:22 p.m. Byrne suffered serious injuries and was transported to Jersey Shore University Medical Center. He is recovering.

Col. Joseph Philbin, the investigation started when state police learned motorcycle gangs were moving into Woonsocket, North Smithfield and Burrillville. Detectives focused on two gangs, The Pagans and Kryptmen. Their members were implicated in drug and gun trafficking, police allege, as well as other crimes. These local chapters are affiliated with some of the countrys most notorious biker gangs – most of which have a history of violent criminal activity including murder, kidnapping, robbery, extortion and large-scale drug trafficking, Lt. Colonel Philbin said. Their brand of crime was coming here, as evidenced by turf fights between rival gangs in northern Rhode Island and increasingly violent confrontations – including three shootings that were never reported to law enforcement. State police also say they stopped a murder, when they took one alleged gang member into custody near the intended victims house. Besides the drugs and gun trafficking and the gang violence, police uncovered other crimes, including the sale of stolen ATVs, lawn tractors, snow blowers and other equipment; fraudulent mortgage and bank activity; and a host of other criminal acts, Lt. Colonel Philbin said. Police decided to move now due to escalating tension and an increased risk of violence in recent weeks.

A California man who lured a Detroit teen into interstate prostitution after forcing her to perform sex acts near the Detroit Jazz Festival last year could up to 27 years in prison when he is sentenced in November. Kevin Brian Keys, 37, of Los Angeles, reportedly kidnapped the 16-year-old and took her on a cross-country sex tour and sold her online for sex with customers while authorities in Michigan searched for her, The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press report. Keys, who goes by Stac a Dollar, pleaded guilty in federal court on Aug. 10 to one count of transporting a minor to engage in prostitution. His trial was to have begun on Aug. 25. Initially, Keys was also charged with sex trafficking of a minor, production of child pornography, distribution of child pornography and possession of child pornography. Keys will serve at least 10 years in prison under the agreement, but federal prosecutors are asking that he be sentenced to between 21 and 27 years in prison, the Free Press said. The judge isnt bound by prosecutors recommendations. Prosecutors allege that Keys invited the teen, who reportedly was traveling between homes in Metro Detroit, to the Jazz Fest and told her she needed to make some money in order for them to leave Michigan, meaning prostitute herself out, Theodore Wolters, a special agent with the Department of Homeland Security, wrote in a court filing. Prosecutors said Keys promised the teen they could make a lot of money if she performed commercial sex dates and that he had done the same with a girl in California. He reportedly rented a tent near the Jazz Festival, and the girl performed sex acts for $50 to $100. Prosecutors said Keys kept the money and bought a Mega Bus ticket for himself and the teen. Keys allegedly planned to hide the girl away until she turned 18, but she became ill in Minnesota and underwent treatment at a hospital, where her true identity was discovered. She was reunited with her family on Sept. 7. Authorities began investigating Keys in early 2015 after linking him to a cell phone the girl had used to call her mother. They searched Keys computer, and discovered conversations that had taken place on Facebook where Keys allegedly tried to sell the teen for sex. He attached a nude photo of her engaging in a sex act, according to court records. The investigation against Keys was conducted by Homeland Security Investigations Operation Predator, established in 2003. Since then, investigators have arrested more than 12,000 people for sex crimes against children. Last year alone, more than 2,300 alleged predators were arrested and more than 1,000 victims were identified and rescued. Human trafficking is a $32 billion global industry, according to the International Labour Organization. About half of that activity takes place in industrialized nations, and women and girls are most often trafficked. The ILO said that in developed countries, women and children make up 11.4 million of victims (55 percent) are trafficked, compared with 9.5 million (45 percent) men. _______Photo via Shutterstock",1

Jennifer Bastian was one of two young girls in the town to be turn up brutally killed in the spring of 1986, and the two cases were long thought to be the work of the same person. But a mans DNA evidence from her bathing suit was tested in 2016 and investigators learned there were two suspects. Robert D. Washburn, 60, was arrested Wednesday at an apartment building in the 700 block of East Bullock Street in Eureka by the Tacoma Police Department with the help of Illinois State Police and the Woodford County Sheriffs Office. The murders of the two girls shook the community. Michella Welch was first to go missing, abducted on March 26, 1986 in Puget Park while taking care of two under sisters, according to the Tacoma News Tribune. On May 14, after a composite sketch of a suspect was released, Washburn called police. He said he had seen someone similar as a fellow jogger in Point Defiance Park, where Bastian would go missing months later. Jennifer Bastian left home on Aug. 4, 1986 on her bicycle to train for an upcoming bike tour in Washingtons San Juan Islands, police said. She left a note saying she would be back by 6:30 p.m. Several people saw her riding her bike around the park that evening, but she never returned home. Bastians parents reported her missing when she didnt return home by 8:30 p.m. Her body was found two weeks later by a jogger in a wooded area with her new 18-speed Schwinn bicycle nearby. Washburn, who lived just nine blocks from the Bastians home, was interviewed again by police in December 1986, KOMO reported. According to court documents, he told detectives he had smelled a foul odor while jogging around the wooded area where Bastians body was later found after an extensive search. The case grew colder, but was never closed. After semen from Bastians bathing suit was tested in 2016, Washburn was on the list of people detectives wanted to check it against.

398,"A driver who allegedly kidnapped a woman but let her out before leading San Francisco police on a pursuit Sunday across the Bay Bridge, which ended in a fiery, fatal crash in Emeryville, has been charged with murder. Michael Brown, 42, is being charged for the June 10 crash, which killed 40-year-old Daphne Bailey. Brown has also been charged with human trafficking, kidnapping, conspiracy, assault and domestic violence. Brown was set to be arraigned Thursday, however, his arraignment was continued to Monday morning. It was not immediately clear if he would be present on Monday, as he remains hospitalized. Although Brown is in the hospital, he remains in police custody and is being held without bail. Hes being represented by the Public Defenders Office. According to police, the alleged offenses began Sunday in San Franciscos Tenderloin neighborhood, when a witness reported seeing Brown beat and force a woman into the trunk of his car near Turk and Leavenworth streets just before 3 p.m. At some point, Brown allegedly allowed the victim to leave somewhere near Van Ness Avenue. Brown then sped off in his car, along with Bailey in the passengers seat, according to court documents. As the pair was driving on the Bay Bridge, heading east, San Francisco officers caught up with them and a pursuit allegedly ensued. The alleged pursuit ended near West MacArthur Boulevard and Peralta Street in Emeryville around 3:20 p.m., when Browns car struck a pole, causing it to go up in flames, court documents said. Bailey was pronounced dead at the scene and Brown was taken out of the vehicle by first responders and transported to the hospital. Court documents allege that Brown was acting as a pimp for Bailey and the kidnapping victim. In April, Brown allegedly enlisted the kidnapping victim to work for him as a prostitute. He would allegedly take her car, cellphone and ID before dropping her off in an area known for prostitution. If the victim did not make enough money for him, he allegedly would often force her to sleep outside, according to court documents. On May 28, the victim failed to give all of her money from prostituting to Brown and he allegedly punched her in the face. Because of this, the following week, she left Brown to work for another pimp. In a plan to apparently punish the victim for leaving him, Brown allegedly got Bailey to lure her to the Tenderloin. On Sunday, Bailey called the victim, telling her that she wanted to celebrate the victims birthday and that she would provide the victim with a cake and a bag of cocaine, court documents allege. The victim agreed and when she went to meet Bailey at Turk and Leavenworth, Brown appeared and allegedly punched the victim in the face, knocking her to the ground. Brown then allegedly dragged the victim to the vehicle, where Bailey allegedly helped him throw the woman into the trunk. Brown allegedly told the victim he was going to kill her. A bystander who witnessed the alleged beating and kidnapping then followed Brown, and eventually called police. After the fatal crash in Emeryville, officers determined that the kidnapping victim had gotten out of the trunk well before the crash. She was taken to a hospital, where she was reported to be in fair condition on Sunday. According to court documents, Brown has a substantial criminal history, with a separate pending felony domestic violence case in San Francisco Superior Court, set for jury trial next week. In addition, hes previously been convicted other crimes, including assault with a deadly weapon in 2002, for which he served three years in state prison; possession of a loaded firearm in 1998, for which he served four years in state prison; and robbery in 1996, for which he served two years in state prison. — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock",1

This is especially true since new GPS technology can immediately pinpoint a robbers location for police. Myles Stephens, 28, appeared for a preliminary hearing in Denver Co. Court last week after being nabbed by police Aug. 15 in connection with an armed, masked robbery of the Green Dragon marijuana dispensary at 5130 E. Colfax. It was a second time for Stephens. He was arrested in 2010 for attempting to rob a medical pot dispensary the same way. Stephens and three other men allegedly burst into the Green Dragon wearing black masks and flashing handguns around 9:30 p.m., according to a police report. One employee escaped out the back door and ran to a gas station where he dialed 911 for help.

A GPS tracker, nestled amongst the cash in the register, also ended up in the backpack. Video surveillance showed the group driving off in a white Dodge Charger. Police quickly tracked the GPS signal to the 3400 block of S. Ash Street, where they observed two men exiting the house into the alley, one wearing a black backpack with pink trim. Cops took Stephens into custody along with Tayone Givens, 21, from whom they recovered a black semi-automatic handgun and cash, police reports said. Two men, Marrell Jones, 27 and Thomas Wilson, 24, were found inside the house, partially undressed as they attempted to change their clothing. A white Dodge Charger was parked behind the house, police reports said. They are charged with armed robbery and kidnapping. In 2010, Stephens and another accomplice tried the same thing, this time at a medical marijuana dispensary at 4625 E. Colfax. Police reports said they ambushed employees leaving at closing time in the alley. Wearing black masks and gloves, Stephens and another man displayed guns and forced the employees back into the shop, where one woman secretly pushed a panic button on a chain around her neck. Stephens was nabbed by police in an alley, while his accomplice sped off in the female employees maroon Ford Explorer, which he later abandoned. Bond was set for half-a-million dollars and Stephens pled guilty to armed robbery in 2012 and had other charges dropped.

406,"A Reston woman involved in the gang-related murder of a 15-year-old girl in Fairfax County has pleaded guilty, according to a report. The Washington Post reports that Cindy Blanco Hernandez, 19, of Reston pleaded guilty to abduction, and she faces up to 20 or 30 years in prison when she faces sentencing May 11, 2018. She was one of 18 young people arrested in connection with the brutal murder of 15-year-old Damaris A. Reyes Rivas of Gaithersburg, Md., in a Springfield park in January. They were believed to be members of the infamous gang MS-13, and prosecutors think they lured Reyes Rivas to the park to exact revenge, as they blamed her for the death of Christian Sosa Rivas, the leader of their clique. The group reportedly threatened to cut off her fingers and set her on fire before they killed her as she stood freezing in the cold. Her killers recorded her last minutes on cell phone videos. Attorneys for Hernandez, the Reston resident, and two other teens say that their clients didnt participate in the slaying of the girl and werent aware of plans to kill her, according to the Post. Hernandez is expected to be a witness in the upcoming trials of three other defendants. Reyes Rivas was lured to the park, thinking she was going to smoke marijuana, but found gang members waiting who immediately began interrogating her about the death of Sosa Rivas. They accused her of luring Sosa Rivas to a park in Dumfries where he was slain around New Years Eve. Reyes Rivas was taken to another park, beaten, and then stabbed 13 times, prosecutors say.

409,"ROCKAWAY, NJ— A man who was indicted on sex abuse and kidnapping charges for touching boys genitals at Rockaway Townsquare Mall and Target has been found not competent to stand trial. Kyriakos Serghides, 35, was found incompetent to help in his own defence by a psychiatrist, the Daily Record reported. That same doctor said medication for bipolar type disorder could make him fit to take the stand. It was a false arrest. I have a right to a speedy trial - thats non-negotiable, the Daily Record reported Serghides as saying. Serghides has refused medication, but still wants a speedy trial. Morris County Assistant Prosecutor Justin Tellone said he should be forcibly medicated. The Rockaway man was first arrested in Sept. 2015 for attempting to kidnap a 5-year-old from a Target in the Rockaway Mall, Patch reported. He was charged at that time with touching another boys genitals in the food court bathroom that August. Later that September, another boy told police Serghides had touched his genitals in the same food court bathroom, Patch reported. These incidents were not Serghides first encounters with law enforcement. He was charged in 2013 with criminal mischief and possession of marijuana stemming from an incident at a gas station in Madison, and two charges of threats to kill in Essex County in 2011. In the Rockaway Mall incidents, Serghides was indicted in Sept. 2016 for attempted kidnapping, luring, sexual assault, terroristic threats, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child. Serghides bail was set a $600,000 total for the three incidents.

410,"ST. A 16-year-old St. Clair Shores girl was reportedly abducted and sexually assaulted while she walked to school, according to a news release. Police report she ultimately fought off her attacker and escaped and the suspect is still at large. The teen was walking to school in the 25000 block of Cubberness on Nov. 28 when a man in a dark-colored Dodge Ram with chrome wheels and side steps stopped and asked for directions, according to the Detroit Free Press. The man allegedly got out of the truck, grabbed the victim by the back of her neck and forced her into the truck before speeding off and starting to sexually assault the teen. The teen fended off her attacker, exited the truck and fled on foot, according to media reports. At 6:47 a.m., the teen came upon St. Clair Shores police officers roughly half a mile from where the abduction happened, who at the time were investigating a larceny from an auto in the 2600 block of Harmon. The teen told officers about the attempted abduction and sexual assault and police immediately launched an investigation. The Lake Shore Public Schools district sent out an email alert notifying parents and the school community about the attack, even though the teen is not a student at the school, and encouraged extra vigilance among students. The suspect remains on the loose. Police reports describe him as a black male, in his 20s, 5 feet, 3 inches tall, about 140 pounds and clean shaven with short dreads or braids.

411,"Chief Mark Segalla and the Reading Police Department are expanding a warning to residents about a telephone scam in which criminals appear capable of spoofing a variety of town and elected officials phone numbers. In the same vein as other widespread telephone scams, the caller tells the resident that they can save money on a specific bill -- electricity, gas, etc. -- by switching to another service. Nearly all official Town of Reading phone numbers begin with either (781) 942 or (781) 944. Chief Segalla warns that residents should NEVER give personal information like social security numbers or credit card numbers to people who call their homes or cell phones unsolicited. The Reading Police first became aware of official phone numbers being used in scams when a resident told police that she received a call on Thursday, April 27, with the caller stating that they can save the homeowner money on their electric bill. The resident did the right thing by immediately hanging up and notifying police. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of taking great care in protecting your personal information and keeping it out of the hands of criminals, Chief Segalla said. All of these scams are illegal, but we find it especially troubling that scammers are attempting to prey on residents by using town and elected officials phone numbers. Common telephones scams that target residents -- specifically seniors -- include: • IRS Impostors: Callers contact you demanding immediate payment for back taxes. • Arrested Relative: Scammers contact you claiming that a friend or relative has been arrested and needs bail money. • Kidnapped Relative: Scammers call to report a friend or relative has been kidnapped and a ransom must be paid. • Threatened Arrest: Scammers call to tell you that you are subject to arrest (by a variety of different agencies: U.S. Marshals, FBI, etc.) and must pay to avoid arrest. • Utility Scam: Scammers pose as bill collectors from utility companies and threaten to shut off service if you do not pay. • Sweepstakes: Someone calls to notify you that you have won a contest or sweepstakes and must send money to collect any winnings. • Tech Support/Malware: Someone contacts you claiming your computer needs repairs and to send money for service or asks to connect to your computer. Additionally, a pop-up can appear on your computer, stating that it is infected with malware, and to call a number to pay to remove the virus. In many of these calls, the scammer demands payment via electronic money order or pre-paid debit card. This should be an immediate red flag. No legitimate vendor will ever demand money via these means. Sending money via money order, or pre-paid debit card is as good as sending cash, and if money is sent to a criminal, it is gone forever and cannot be recovered. If anyone has any questions or feels that they have been victimized, they are encouraged to call Reading Police at 781-944-1212",0

We are continuing to investigate this case to the fullest extent possible, said U.S. Marshal Don OKeefe.

443,"The reward is $5,000 for information in the armed home-invasion robbery of a jewelry store worker in Chesterfield, according to Chesterfield police. Police said they were following up on leads. A different source, who did not want to be identified, said Tuesday morning the reward was up to $25,000. Ahome-invasion robbery took place Thursday night in Chesterfield in the 13000 block of LaBarge Drive, off Woods Mill Road near Olive Boulevard. A masked gunman pistol-whipped a man—the jewelry store employee, took his wife hostage and made off with a bag of jewelry and other valuables, all while children slept in rooms nearby. Chesterfield police detectives were working to identify the suspect based on the victims descriptions: Last seen wearing: Police were not revealing the name of the victims, who live in a condo on LaBarge Drive. The gunman fled shortly before police arrived at the condo, Chesterfield police Sgt. Christopher Connelly said. Police said the gunman surprised the homeowner with a gun to the back of his head, just outside the unlocked sliding glass back door of his home. The victim had returned from an errand about 9:50 p.m. Thursday, police said. When the victim spoke up, the gunman allegedly pistol-whipped him on the head, causing a lump, police said. At gunpoint, the two went inside and upstairs to a bedroom where the victims wife was then taken hostage. Police said the gunman instructed her to take a pillowcase and stuff jewelry into it, while her husband was made to get down on the floor. The couples children were asleep in rooms nearby. The gunman took the wife downstairs to allegedly get more valuables, threatening her with harm if the husband made a move to get off the floor. However, the husband called police on his cell phone from the upstairs bedroom and described the robbery in progress, police said. Connelly said by the time he and eight police cars got to the residence, the gunman had fled. Police said there was no evidence yet how the gunman got away. Late Friday, there was no indication whether neighbors had seen anything unusual, or whether the suspect had somehow followed the victim home from errands. On the other hand, police said its possible the gunman knew his victim through jewelry business dealings. It was not likely the suspect would return to the residence since police were on the lookout, Connelly said. The $25,000 reward is being offered by a local business and the Pawnbrokers Association, for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect, police said. Anyone recognizing the suspect should contact the Chesterfield Detective Bureau at 636-537-3000 or St. Louis Crime Stoppers at 314-725-8477 (TIPS).",1

Virts was sentenced to life without parole on Friday, according to the Baltimore County States Attorney. He killed Cortez while she was trying to sleep on March 5, 2014, the states attorney reported. She awoke during the attack and died from stab wounds to her neck, chest and abdomen, the report said, noting she also had wounds on her hands and arm. Virts had been staying with Cortez, and the two were supposed to have a custody hearing on March 6, 2014, according to The Baltimore Sun. Instead, he killed her with a butcher knife beforehand because he was concerned he would no longer be able to see their children, the newspaper reported. He then took his 11-year-old daughter from the home and fled out of state, triggering an Amber alert and national manhunt. The day after the two disappeared, a hotel clerk in South Carolina called police when she recognized them from an Amber Alert post she saw on Facebook. Facebook in January said that the case inspired the social media site to begin including Amber alerts in peoples news feeds based on their location. As part of his plea agreement, Virts pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, while the other charges against him were dropped. Those charges were first-degree assault; kidnapping; attempted second-degree sex offense; hiding a child out-of-state; kidnapping a child under 16; attempted sex abuse of a minor; theft from $1,000 to $10,000; and unlawful taking of a motor vehicle.",0

449,"July 23, 2013 - 10:20 a.m.He snuck into the Ripken family garage, drove the family matriarch around the Baltimore region and returned her under the veil of darkness in a 24-hour span. The man who terrorized Aberdeens first family of baseball remains at large, nearly a year after kidnapping Vi Ripken and leaving Cal Ripken, the baseball Hall of Famer, and the rest of the family to anticipate the worst. The case has been as baffling as it could have been tragic. The man captured on video, still camera images and in a police sketch has eluded Aberdeen police and assisting agencies—including the Harford County Sheriffs Office, Maryland State police, Baltimore County police and Baltimore City police—in the investigation. We would still consider it to be active, Aberdeen police spokesman Lt. Fred Budnick told Patch. Were still looking for help from citizens. Anyone with information or a tip may contact Aberdeen police at 410-265-8080. The Ripken family declined comment for this story. At a news conference in Baltimore following the abduction last year, Cal Ripken described the ordeal as the worst feeling you could imagine, his eyes welling up as he described the uncertainty of the night of July 24, 2012. Earlier that day, his 74-year-old mother was taken. She was found tied up in her car, a short distance from her home, around 6:15 a.m. on July 25, police said. Ripken said last year that he had received a call from his sister, Ellen, around 9 p.m. on July 24. She relayed that police had received information about Vi Ripkens car being observed driven somewhere in eastern Baltimore County. A woman was seen tied up in the back seat. I actually physically got in the car and drove around, Cal Ripken said at the time. It would be like finding a needle in a haystack, I suppose, but it made me feel like I was doing something that evening, he said. I think we were hardening ourselves for the worst possibility. I know I was. It was a horrible night, he said. The case was featured on Americas Most Wanted and drew national media attention. Mrs. Ripken moved in with family immediately after her abduction and eventually assimilated to her routine—participating in the Christmas Street Parade, attending IronBirds games and remaining active in a number of community initiatives.

450,"A former U.S. Marine is expected to plead guilty to kidnapping on Thursday morning in a bizarre case that led to a lawsuit against Vallejo police for falsely accusing the two victims of faking their own abduction, according to court filings. Officials with the U.S. Attorneys Office in the Eastern District of California filed a memorandum for an inquiry into the mental health of Matthew Muller to ensure he understands the proceedings before changing his plea. He is scheduled to return to court in Sacramento at 9:30 a.m. Thursday. Muller was indicted last year for assaulting a Vallejo woman and her boyfriend in their Mare Island home as they slept on March 23, 2015. According to a lawsuit filed by the couple, the assailant bound them both with zip ties, blindfolded them, drugged them and interrogated them in separate rooms. He eventually took the woman, still bound and blindfolded, in the truck of his car and raped her twice, holding her hostage while keeping her blindfolded with taped-over swim goggles, according to the suit. During that time, the kidnapper contacted the news media and sent a recording of the woman. Eventually she was released two days later near her parents home in Huntington Beach. During the time she was held captive, Vallejo police first accused her boyfriend of killing her, then when she was found safe, they called a news conference and accused the couple of fabricating the entire ordeal. Eventually Dublin police and the FBI connected Muller to the crime through a similar home invasion robbery in Dublin a few months later on June 5. In that case, a masked man broke into a couples home as they slept and tried to bind them, but they attacked him and chased him out of the house. Dublin police learned of two other similar incidents in Mountain View and Palo Alto. In both incidents, a masked man wearing all black bound, blindfolded and drugged sleeping victims and tried to rob them and rape them, according to the suit. Palo Alto police had even questioned Muller. After Dublin police tracked Muller through a cellphone he left behind at the robbery scene, the FBI connected him to the Vallejo kidnapping through evidence found at Mullers mothers home in South Lake Tahoe. He was arrested June 8, 2015. Muller pleaded no contest last September to attempted robbery, burglary and assault with a deadly weapon for the Dublin home invasion and was indicted in October on the federal charges. Meanwhile, the lawsuit filed by the kidnapping victims against the Vallejo Police Department, including Detective Matthew Mustard and spokesman Lt. Kenny Park, is still pending in federal court. The couple is seeking unspecified damages for defamation, unreasonable search and seizure, false arrest and false imprisonment. Previous: By Bay City News Photo via Shutterstock",1

455,"(Editors note: The following statement was released by Fairfax County on Monday regarding the death of resident John Geer, who was shot and killed by a Fairfax County police officer in 2013 during a standoff.) The Fairfax County Police Department reports that the Circuit Court of Fairfax County has determined that the department may release some information pertaining to the August 29, 2013, officer-involved shooting of John Geer, even while the investigations into the incident remain ongoing. On August 29, 2013, Fairfax County police officers responded to a call by Geers domestic partner reporting a domestic dispute with Geer. Officers spoke to the complainant and Geer outside their residence. Geer was reported as having multiple firearms inside the home, displaying a firearm that he threatened to use against the police, and refused the officers requests that he remain outside and speak to them. Officers, including a trained negotiator, attempted to peaceably resolve the situation. They spoke with Geer for more than thirty minutes as he stood in the doorway of his home. When Geer began lowering his hands at one point during the negotiations, PFC Adam Torres fired a single shot that struck Geer. Geer immediately retreated inside the home and shut the front door. Geer did not answer the officers calls and offers of medical aid. A SWAT Team and a hostage rescue vehicle were used to effectuate a safe approach and entry into the home. Once inside, the SWAT officers, who were accompanied by a tactical paramedic, found Geer deceased. A loaded, holstered firearm was recovered on the landing of the stairs to Geers left where he had stood in the doorway and seven more firearms were recovered inside the home. This matter is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Department of Justice and an internal, administrative investigation by the Police Department. Officer Torres, who has been employed by the Police Department for eight years, was placed on administrative duty following the incident and remains so pending the outcome of the criminal and administrative investigations. The following statement is from Sharon Bulova, chair, Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. On behalf of the Board of Supervisors, I would like to express my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of John Geer. Any untimely death is a tragedy, and our Board continues to be extremely frustrated and disappointed with the amount of time it has taken for this investigation to come to a resolution.I am pleased that the information and details we are releasing today are now available to the public. This breaks the logjam that has prevented the sharing of information that the public and the Geer family have been requesting. In the Geer case, there are three separate investigations and a civil lawsuit. The County has policies in place to avoid interfering with and jeopardizing open criminal and civil cases. The court order resolves staff concerns regarding what could and could not be shared.This is an unusual and complicated situation for Fairfax County. Our current policies regarding a police involved shooting do not address the unique situation where the Commonwealths Attorney refers a case to federal investigators. Our Board will thoroughly review these policies to make sure we are consistently responsive and transparent with regard to police incidents and public safety concerns.In Fairfax County, we have worked very hard to build trust within the community, especially with the Police Department, and our policies must reflect this.Statistically, Fairfax County is the safest jurisdiction of its size in the United States and I am very proud of our public safety professionals who help to make that happen. In Fairfax County, our police officers enjoy a strong and positive partnership with the community they serve and protect. Each of our eight Police Districts has a Citizens Advisory Committee that meets regularly. At these meetings, residents of the area have the opportunity to learn of safety issues in their community and share information that is of concern to them. Additionally, the Countys Neighborhood Watch programs operate with strong support from and collaboration with our Police Department. All of our Fairfax County high schools and middle schools benefit from specifically trained School Resource Officers.As Chairman, I have made it a point to ride throughout the County with the Police Chief on National Night Out and I can tell you that the communitys trust and appreciation of our police officers is enormous. Most recently, Chief Roessler established a Police Department Diversity Council, consisting of representatives of our Countys minority populations, to help ensure law enforcements sensitivity to the many cultural differences that exist within our community.The unique positive relationship that our Police Department has established with the community they serve is significant. This has helped to foster trust of public safety and is a major factor in keeping our crime rate extraordinarily low. While this has been a unique and complicated set of circumstances, our Board is committed to making sure Fairfax County policies will not result in delays should similar situations arise in the future.Fairfax County has provided all information and materials requested in order for these investigations to move forward. We join with the Geer family and the community in urging a fair and timely resolution.",0

457,"For over 10 years, the Walpole Police Department in collaboration with the Walpole Recreation Department has taught hundreds of women the Rape Aggression Defense Course, also known as RAD. The program provides women with the essential options necessary to defend against an attacker. During the 12-hour program taught by Walpole officers in four, 3-hour blocks, the women are instructed on a variety of physical defense mechanisms and techniques used to physically protect themselves from an adversary. The women are also taught how to recognize uncertain and dynamic factors through risk awareness, risk assessment and risk reduction. During the final few hours of the program, the women are subjected to live simulated attacks by trained aggressors who are also Walpole police officers. The department has trained women from as young as 13 to senior citizens and is proud to offer such an important program through our recreation center. Now, the department will have the enhanced ability to offer this same type of program to children. Last week, two Walpole Police Officers, Jaclyn Hazeldine and John Thayer attended a 40-hour RAD-KIDS, Instructor Course on Cape Cod. RAD-KIDS is a national leader in the safety of children and offers a curriculum for kids that includes topics such as home, school and vehicle safety; how to protect themselves from physical harm or violence, defense against abduction, self-realization of personal power and much more. The department currently has seven officers who are trained in RAD and Advanced RAD. Officer Hazeldine has been instrumental in helping institute the program in Walpole over 10 years ago and continues to ensure the program expands to include our children through RAD-KIDS. The officers look forward to helping citizens avoid victimization and assist in empowering those who may be most vulnerable.",0

Needless to say, they are distraught and heartbroken. Please respect their privacy and that they are dealing with a very tragic loss. This is an ongoing investigation and remains very active. The homicide unit and members of my office are on the scene and have been on the scene all weekend. They have spent dozens of hours and the work there is not done. It will be investigated for days to come. We expect to be there for quite some time. The causes of death have not been released, but they are being investigated as suspicious, Gulluni said. Weldon was initially arrested after a car chase with police in which he crashed into a cruiser and then wrestled with the officers. The woman who was in Weldons car told police he had her captive for a month, sexually assaulted her, and beat her with objects. By early Friday morning, an underground radar imaging service had been set up and more shovels and barricades had come out, according to MassLive.

Until Browns cell phone service was restored -- per his request, which can be heard on this audio -- this was the only source of communication from inside the hostage house and police on the outside.

464,"The FBI today accused North Korea of being behind the cyberattack that prompted Sony Pictures to cancel the release of The Interview, a development raising fears among entertainers that the free speech rights of Americans are threatened. As a result of our investigation, and in close cooperation with other U.S. government departments and agencies, the FBI now has enough information to conclude that the North Korean government is responsible for these actions, according to an FBI statement. Before the statement was issued, actor George Clooney said he and his agent circulated a petition in support of Sony after it became the victim of a the cyberattack and before it cancelled the Christmas Day release of The Interview, but none of the many entertainment figures who were asked to sign it agreed to do so. The thrust of the petition circulated by Clooney and his agent, Bryan Lourd, was were not going to give in to a ransom, Clooney said. He further accused the press of abdicating its responsibility to focusing on salacious Sony email links rather than investigating the hackers. A good portion of the press abdicated its real duty. They played the fiddle while Rome burned, he told Deadline Hollywood. There was a real story going on. With just a little bit of work, you could have found out that it wasnt just probably North Korea; it was North Korea, he said. The FBI, in effectively confirming Clooneys assertion, said it found telltale signs in the cyberattack. The FBI has determined that the intrusion into (Sony Pictures Entertainments) network consisted of the deployment of destructive malware and the theft of proprietary information, as well as employees personally identifiable information and confidential communications ... the FBI statement said. Technical analysis of the data deletion malware used in this attack revealed links to other malware that the FBI knows North Korean actors previously developed.",0

Hugo Munguia-Hernandez Jr. was sentenced Wednesday by Judge Barbara Mallach, prosecutors said Thursday. Munguia-Hernandez was burglarizing the victims home on Edinburgh Street in the Aragon neighborhood when she got home from grocery shopping at about 12:30 p.m. March 17, 2014, prosecutors said. The victim lived alone and Munguia-Hernandez first attacked her and used a stun gun on her neck, face and arms multiple times, according to prosecutors. He then gagged her with a sock and told her would kill her, her family and burn down her house if she reported him to police, according to prosecutors. Munguia-Hernandez bound the womans wrists and ankles, covered her head with bags and put her in the master bedroom closet for hours, prosecutors said. The victim spent much of the night tied to a chair in the hallway with a bag covering her head while Munguia-Hernandez stole her TV, jewelry, wallet and used her ATM card multiple times, according to prosecutors. He made her strip and shower the next day to remove the remnants of tape from her face, prosecutors said. The woman was able to free herself and call police after Munguia-Hernandez left, according to prosecutors. Police identified him after they released his image from a video system at a Bank of America, prosecutors said. Officers arrested him 12 days after the crime and found the stun gun and some of the stolen goods at his home, according to prosecutors. He was convicted earlier this year of 12 charges, including kidnapping, robbery, assault and identity theft.

475,"Image: Jesse Matthew (Fairfax County Police Department) Jesse Matthew, the Charlottesville man accused of sexually assaulting a Fairfax City woman in 2005, entered an Alford plea to the charges Wednesday, according to media reports. He entered the plea during his trial in Fairfax Circuit Court on three charges: attempted capital murder, abduction and sexual assault. The charges stem from the decade-old case in which a woman walking home from a local grocery store was abducted and molested, according to media reports. In an Alford plea, a criminal defendant claims innocence, but acknowledges that prosecutors have enough evidence to convict him. Before the trial, Matthew had pleaded not guilty to the charges; his move on Wednesday means the jury will not decide on a verdict or sentence, effectively ending the trial. Judge David Schell accepted the plea deal, and Matthew became a convicted rapist. Matthew, 33, entered the Alford plea to all three charges, each of which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Schell is scheduled to sentence Matthew on Oct. 2, radio station WTOP reported. The victim traveled from India with two small children to testify at a pretrial hearing Thursday. On Monday, she testified at the trial about the sexual assault, describing that September night in frightening detail. But she did not explicitly identify Matthew as the assailant, according to media reports. The plea deal came at midday, after prosecutors rested their case against Matthew, according to WRC-TV Channel 4. In testimony earlier Wednesday, a forensic scientist said that DNA evidence found under one of the victims fingernails linked Matthew to the crime. Matthew also has been linked by DNA evidence to the killing of Hannah Graham, a University of Virginia student. Graham vanished in September, and her remains were found about five weeks later. In that case, Matthew faces charges in Albemarle County of capital murder, first-degree murder and abduction with intent to defile. A trial has not been scheduled in that case.",1
476,"- A Marietta man convicted of raping and robbing two women was sentenced on Thursday to two consecutive life sentences plus 25 years to serve in prison. On Tuesday, a Cobb jury convicted Lemon McMickens of 15 counts, including two counts each of rape, kidnapping, armed robbery, and aggravated assault, and three counts of possession of a firearm during commission of a felony. Jurors also convicted McMickens of aggravated sodomy, theft by receiving, possession of a controlled substance, and misdemeanor marijuana possession. Both attacks occurred about 3 a.m. In the first attack, on Sept. 18, 2013, McMickens used a firearm to force a woman from the parking lot of her apartment complex at 2350 Cobb Parkway in Smyrna to a secluded area, where he raped her. Afterward, he robbed her of money. A few months later, on Feb. 1, 2014, McMickens snatched another woman off of Franklin Road at gunpoint and attempted to rob her. When he didnt find any money, he demanded she undress, and struck her with the weapon when she refused. He then raped her.

I lost my everything, she said. Assistant District Attorney Lindsay Gardner said the defendant is a predator who lurked in the dead of night to prey on innocent women.

480,"A 60-year-old former Laguna Beach man faces a retrial in July on charges of soliciting the murder of a federal judge, two prosecutors and a pair of FBI agents, according to court records obtained today. John Arthur Walthall, who was doing time in federal prison for a gold investment scheme, was indicted in December 2014 with soliciting the killing of U.S. District Judge Andrew Guilford, who sentenced him to 14 years behind bars, and the others. At his sentencing April 30, 2012, the defendant argued with the judge, tried to fire his attorney and lashed out at his fraud victims. The judge scolded Walthall for repeatedly interrupting him, threatened to have him removed from the courtroom and even accused the defendant of lying about his health so he could delay his trial. From day one, Ive been caught up in an entrapment and fraud scheme, Walthall said at his April 2012 sentencing. At one point as he was facing trial in the fraud case he jumped bail and fled to Nevada, but he was later recaptured and went to trial. He was convicted Dec. 2, 2011, of four counts of wire fraud and a count of failure to appear. He was arrested in 2009 and indicted for defrauding a Laguna Niguel couple, who were in their 80s, and using their money to buy investments and cover personal expenses. A relative of one of Walthalls fellow inmates contacted the FBI in March 2014 to say the defendant was allegedly attempting to make plans to have someone kill the judge and the others, according to court records. Two inmates eventually cooperated with investigators and passed on several notes Walthall wrote detailing his alleged plans to kidnap and kill the victims, according to federal prosecutors. In one note, Walthall allegedly asked for ingredients for a poison to administer to one of the other inmates if they betrayed him, prosecutors have alleged. One of the inmates cooperating with authorities directed Walthall to a cousin, who was actually an undercover agent, prosecutors allege. Part of the alleged bizarre plan included having Guilford kidnapped and compelled to make a statement on video that he rigged legal proceedings against anyone who was convicted in his court, prosecutors have alleged. Defendant then wanted Judge Guilford to be handcuffed and shoved in a (expletive)... wood chipper and said, I want his eye cut out of his head, so then we can see eye to eye. I want to keep a (expletive) sample of him, but I know that I cant,  prosecutors alleged in court papers filed last year. Jurors deadlocked on Thursday 10-2 for guilt, according to Walthalls attorney, Tim Scott. Walthalls attorney argued entrapment and insanity defenses, he said. Walthall was ordered to return to court June 27 for a pretrial conference with a retrial scheduled for July 12. City News Service",0
481,"In light of a recent abduction attempt of a 10-year-old girl at the First Baptist Church of Lilburn, Lilburn Police Capt. Thomas Bardugon offers tips to parents on how to prevent child abductions. If youre going to send your kids out to some place and they want to play, just be mindful of where they are, said Bardugon. If you see something unusual, intercede and make sure that youre keeping an eye on things. He also gave advice for children who find themselves in a possible abduction situation. Walk away, and go to someone you trust, Bardugon added. Go back to mom, go back to dad, and dont engage in them at all. In the recent abduction attempt, a girl had rollerblading at the parking lot of the Main Street church with her mom nearby. A man drove up in his car, a gray or dark-colored Dodge Charger, and started speaking with the girl. After saying that she could have been a model and asking her if she wanted to race, he told her to get in his car. At that time, the man saw the mom start walking toward her daughter, which caused him to drive away. This occurred in a matter of 10 to 15 seconds, Bardugon said. The mother and daughter soon left and arrived at a nearby Shell gas station on the corner of Rockbridge Road and Lilburn-Stone Mountain Road, where they saw the man a second time. He left shortly after the girl pointed him out to her mom. Police have released a sketch of the man, as well photos of him and his car. The authorities are treating him as a person of interest, since there are no charges present as of Tuesday afternoon. Anyone that can identify the unknown suspect or have information regarding this or similar cases should contact the Lilburn Police Department at 770-921-2211. See also: Dont miss any Lilburn news.

The New York Daily News reports that Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, who was arrested along with Lucas Morten, told prosecutors he was training 11 malnourished children found at the filthy compound near the Colorado border to carry out shooting sprees. The children, some as young as 1, were rescued Friday. Authorities had been looking for Wahhaj, 39, who had been wanted in Clayton County in the disappearance of his toddler son. He and Morten, also from Georgia, were arrested at the compound. (For more news like this, find your local Patch here. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app; download the free Patch Android app here.) Investigators got a lead, and a reason to search the compound, when someone believed to be there sent a message to a third party saying they were starving and needed food and water. Wahhaj is the son of radical Imam Siraj Wahhaj who, as the Daily News notes, federal officials have called an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. In addition to the children, five adults were found at the compound. They and the children looked like third-world country refugees not only with no food or fresh water, but with no shoes, personal hygiene and basically dirty rags for clothing, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said in a news release. Wahhajs young son was not one of the children rescued and prosecutors believe he may be buried at the compound, the Daily News reported. Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, who lived with his mother in the Atlanta area, went missing back in December. Hogrefe said Wednesday that a body believed to be his was found at the compound on Tuesday. Three women, believed to be the childrens mothers, were detained for questioning and released pending the outcome of an investigation. Morten has been charged with harboring a fugitive and Wahhaj was booked on his no-bond Georgia warrant for child abduction.

489,"Michelle Suzanne Hadley, a 30-year-old Orange County woman, was wrongfully imprisoned, according to the Orange County District Attorneys office, who removed charges against her earlier this week. When a person who has committed a crime gets arrested and charged, thats a bad day, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said. But when someone who is innocent gets arrested and charged with some crime, thats not just a bad day — its a nightmare. This is the tale of a woman who faced such a nightmare, but with the help of her attorney and law enforcement, who continued to seek the truth, she will be able to be exonerated. Hadley previously spent several months behind bars in one of the strangest social media harassment cases to cross the wires in recent years. Orange County District Attorneys stated that Hadley was falsely accused of using online classified ads to encourage men to fulfill rape fantasies with her romantic rival Angela Maria Diaz earlier this year. Prosecutors this week dropped charges against Hadley.  Bizarre Love Triangle Hadley was engaged for about two years to a U.S. Marshals Service agent. Diaz allegedly used sophisticated computer software to spoof emails and make it appear Hadley was posting online classified ads encouraging men to sexually assault Diaz. After Diaz allegedly staged an attempted sexual assault on herself in which she had red marks on her neck and breast, police arrested Hadley, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told reporters. At some point during the investigation, as authorities were seeking computer addresses for the origin of those emails, they began to suspect Diaz was framing Hadley, Deputy District Attorney Rick Zimmer said. Diaz also is accused of doctoring a paycheck to add $2,000, an alleged crime uncovered during the investigation. Diaz is additionally accused of faking cervical cancer, masquerading as an attorney, forging doctors notes, faking a pregnancy and posing as two ex-girlfriends of her estranged husband, prosecutors said. From what were seeing, shes a serial con artist, Zimmer alleged. She duped us. It was very sophisticated, well thought out and took a great deal of planning. The estranged husband has not been accused of wrongdoing, but the investigation is ongoing, Rackauckas said. Hadley was previously falsely accused of directing multiple threats against Diaz and an unborn child via email between June and July of last year. It appears Diaz faked a sonogram of twins at one point, Zimmer said. We dont believe she was ever actually pregnant, he said. Hadley was served with a protective order June 6 prohibiting her from contacting Diaz, but the false stalking continued, according to Zimmer. After the posting of Craigslist ads inviting men over to fulfill rape fantasies, at least two responded, including a 17-year-old boy, Zimmer said. Diaz called Anaheim police June 24 to report that a man got into her garage and attempted to rape her before she was able to call for help and scare off her attacker, Rackauckas said. Hadley was arrested later that day, and the threatening emails ceased, Rackauckas said. But once Hadley posted bail and was released, the threats resumed, he said. The emailed threats included images of decapitated bodies and aborted fetuses, the countys top prosecutor said. Hadley was arrested again on July 14 and was ordered held on $1 million bail. She was released on her own recognizance Oct. 7 when investigators noticed the alleged cracks in Diazs story, prosecutors said. Zimmer said he felt sick to my stomach when he began to realize an innocent person had been jailed. Ive had more sleepless nights these past six months than Ive ever had, Zimmer said. The last thing our office wants to do is charge an innocent person. Investigators suspect Diaz might have learned how to spoof emails and disguise the origins of the correspondence through her job with a U.S. Bankruptcy trustee, Zimmer said. In that line of work, she became familiar with virtual private networks, or VPNs. Hadleys attorney, Michael Guisti, told reporters that he thought prosecutors should have waited to check the internet addresses on the emails before moving in for the arrest, but he was grateful that investigators worked to exonerate his client. I cant thank Rick enough for his instincts, Guisti said of Zimmer. This is such a relief for Michelle. The defense attorney believes the man the two women have in common was somehow involved, characterizing him as manipulative. But Zimmer said there is no evidence so far that the man conspired with Diaz to frame Hadley. Diaz could face up to nearly 14 years behind bars if convicted. In other odd social media cases, Orange County prosecutors last year cleared a man of stalking, kidnapping and beating charges when investigators learned that his ex- girlfriend was setting him up. Stephanie Renae Lawson pleaded guilty Nov. 30 and was sentenced to a year in jail for using a fake Facebook profile to issue the bogus threats. In both cases, investigators issues investigators had with telecommunications companies obtaining records of their customers to verify evidence. Images, Courtesy OCDAs Office",0

The pair will appear in Montgomery County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court in Virginia Friday for a preliminary hearing in the case. The purpose of the hearing is to determine whether there is enough evidence to send the case to a grand jury, according to the Roanoke Times, which reported Friday is the first time Keepers and Eisenhauer will appear in court together. Officials suspect Lovell had an inappropriate relationship with Eisenhauer, who allegedly killed the girl to keep her from revealing the nature of their connection.

491,"Burlington Police are warning residents of a kidnapping scam after a local mother and her son were tricked into thinking the other had been kidnapped for ransom, police announced Monday. According to the release from the Burlington Police Department, a local woman reported to the police station on Aug. 17 claiming kidnappers had called her demanding ransom money for her son. Police promptly located the son, and determined not only his safety but that he had received the same call regarding his mother.

494,"Two suspects were arrested in Emeryville on Wednesday in connection with multiple crimes related to a 15-year-old girl from Pleasant Hill who went missing late last month. Jadonna Alfay Thibodeaux, 26, of Emeryville, was arrested on suspicion of child endangerment, abduction of a minor with intent to prostitute and pimping a minor victim under 16 years old.

Police said the arrests were the result of an investigation that began April 30 when the Pleasant Hill Police Department contacted Emeryville police regarding a missing juvenile. Pleasant Hill investigators located the phone number for Crutcher in the missing juveniles cellphone, police said. Detectives called Crutcher, but he denied knowing the juvenile or her whereabouts, police said. Within hours of the phone call, the juvenile was located at a BART station in Pleasant Hill on May 1. Pleasant Hill police had said the girl was considered at-risk because she is developmentally disabled but appears physically mature for her age. She was reunited with her family and said she met Crutcher on a bus in Contra Costa County. She said he enticed her to stay with him and his wife for a few days at their residence in Emeryville, police said.

498,"- Every 40 seconds, the time it takes to heat up a slice of pizza in the microwave, a child is reported missing somewhere in America. Some are runaways, but others are abducted. Most have come home alive, due in part to efforts like those taking place Friday, May 25, on National Missing Childrens Day to reunite kids and their families. In Tennessee, at least 116 children have been reported as missing since 1994. Thats according to a database kept by the Polly Klaas Foundation that includes the names of more than 9,800 children reported missing from 1994-2017. The foundation is named for the California 12-year-old who was stolen from her home on Oct. 1, 1993, by a knife-wielding intruder who interrupted a childrens slumber party and carried her away. Her body was found nine weeks later, on Dec. 3, 1993. The actual number of kids who are reported missing every year is hard to calculate, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, established in 1984 to provide a coordinated national approach to find missing kids. Because some children are never reported missing and others, like repeat runaways, are entered in the FBI National Crime Information Center each time they run away, theres no way to reliably know how many children are missing. Since its founding nearly 35 years ago, the NCMEC has assisted in the recovery of more than 260,000 children. But some have never been found. Still missing in Williamson County, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, are these children: The nonprofit National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was established by parents like John and Revé Walsh, whose 6-year-old son, Adam, was abducted from a Florida shopping mall in 1981 and later found murdered. Before the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children existed, police could enter information about stolen cars, guns and other items on the FBIs crime database, but not stolen children. The Adam Walsh disappearance was among several tragic cases that illuminated the need for a nationwide, coordinated system to address the problem of missing children. Others included Etan Patz, a 6-year-old who vanished from a New York street on the way to school in 1979. Over the next several years, 29 children and young adults reported as missing were found murdered in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1982, West Des Moines, Iowa, paperboy Johnny Gosch, 12, never came home from his paper route. His disappearance remains unsolved. Former President Ronald Reagan was an honored guest when the NCMEC opened its doors in 1984. A year earlier, he had proclaimed every May 25 as National Missing Childrens Day. Since then, the Department of Justice has annually commemorated National Missing Childrens Day with a ceremony honoring heroic and exemplary efforts of agencies, organizations and individuals to protect children, and to coordinate efforts to reunite missing children with their families. The problem of missing children is particularly acute in California, which accounts for nearly half of the missing children cases documented on the Polly Klaas Foundation website. The states with the most missing children reports since 1994 are: California: 4,541Texas: 489Florida: 364Arizona: 246New York: 223Washington: 218Ohio: 209Colorado: 183Illinois: 177Georgia: 171Oregon: 153Pennsylvania: 153Nevada: 150Michigan: 130Indiana: 124 Photo by Lightspring / Shutterstock",1

So Cacaic let McSween finish closing up the Mentor-on-the-Lake bar by herself that early morning of Nov. 26, 2010. It would be the last time he saw her alive. The trail of blood After almost two weeks of jury selection, the jury in the Joseph Thomas murder trial began hearing evidence Tuesday in Lake County Court of Common Pleas. Thomas, 28, is accused of raping and murdering McSween, who lived in Mentor. The charred remains of murder victim McSweens sweater, bra, pants and purse were found in a burn barrel in the backyard of Thomas former residence on Marine Parkway, Lake County Assistant Prosecutor Charles Cichocki said in his opening statement Tuesday morning. However, the burned clothes were not found until five months after McSweens body was found. McSween was discovered in the wooded area behind a house, next to the bar, that Cacaic also owned. She was naked except for two brown tube socks, Mentor-on-the-Lake Police Chief John Gielink testified. However, when Cacaic returned to his bar that morning, he didnt see McSweens body at first. What he saw was blood on the grass, even though it had rained during the night. McSweens blood wasnt just on the grass, Cichocki said. It was on the side of the house that Cacaic rented to Margaret Huelsman, one of McSweens coworkers. Her blood was also on its steps and the outside of its windows. A bloody handmark was smeared near the door. Meanwhile, James Yager -- who owned a nearby auto marina -- found a shoe and black pair of womens underwear that proved to be McSweens by his business. Cacaic woke Huelsman and called police. So they, police officers and Yager searched for the source of all the blood. It was Yager who found McSween first, he testified. Cichocki listed her many injuries during his opening statement: Her face had been repeatedly punched, a bone in her neck was snapped because she had been choked, her throat was slashed and she was stabbed five times in the back, Cichocki said. She was dead -- most likely bled to death. The burned sweater Joseph Thomas was one of the people in the bar the night McSween was murdered. Neither the prosecutors nor Thomas attorneys dispute that. The vast majority of facts presented by the prosecutor, we have no qualms with, Thomas attorney David Doughten said during his opening statement. We disagree on what can be inferred from these facts. Doughten told the jury that Thomas went to the bar, drank some, played a little pool and went home. While prosecutors said Thomas attacked McSween as she was leaving the bar, raped and murdered her. Then, they believe, he took her sweater, pants, bra and purse and burned them in his backyard. Police interviewed Thomas in December 2010. However, he was not identified as a suspect until April 2011. In April, police officers canvassed the neighborhood where the murder occurred, hoping to find McSweens clothes. A resident told police that he saw a man, on the Friday after Thanksgiving, standing in the rain and burning something in the backyard of 5589 Marine Parkway, Cichocki said. When police searched the backyard, they found the barrel containing charred clothing. DNA tests later matched blood found on the sweater to McSween, Cichocki said. Thomas was living at the Marine Parkway house at the time of the murder, though he later moved away. Doughten pointed out that the evidence was not found until after Thomas had moved away. Doughten then asked why Thomas would continue to live at the house so long after the crime if he knew evidence linking him to it was nearby. Thomas has been indicted on charges of rape, tampering with evidence, aggravated robbery, kidnapping and aggravated murder. His trial will continue this afternoon with the prosecutions witnesses. Additionally, the trial is expected to continue all week in Lake County Common Pleas Judge Richard Collins Jr.s courtroom.",0

504,"As the investigation into the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history continued, officials began the slow task of releasing the names of those killed in the early Sunday attack at a gay nightclub in Orlando. Some of those identified were in their 30s. More were in their 20s. Disclosure of the the victims names was slowed by a need to inform family first and because the club, called Pulse, was transformed from a place of dance, drink and fun to the grimmest of crime scenes, preventing medical workers from retrieving some of the 50 dead for hours while investigators sifted through evidence. Overnight, officials released additional names. However, the identities of more than half of the victims have yet to be made public. See: List of Victims Killed In Orlando Shooting Vigils and tributes to the fallen included a moment of silence Sunday evening, requested by Florida Gov. Rick Scott. President Barack Obama has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of those killed in the club shooting. The top of the Empire State building — which has seemingly shined in a thousand different colors over the years — went dark Sunday night. Obama described the attack as an act of terror and hate. The suspect, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, reportedly swore allegiance to the head of the Islamic State in a call to authorities just prior to the attack. The shooting took place at Pulse Orlando Night Club & Ultra Lounge, a popular gay bar, where about 350 people were dancing and drinking. A state of emergency for Orange County was declared by the City of Orlando and Scott. Mateen was killed by law enforcement in an exchange of gunfire, according to Orlando Police Chief John Mina. Eleven city officers and three deputies involved in the shooting have been placed on leave. An Orlando police officer was shot during the exchange of bullets, but police say his Kevlar helmet saved him. Seddique Mir Mateen, the father of the shooter, posted a video on his Facebook page early Monday lamenting the loss of his son and his actions. My son, Omar Mateen, was a very good boy, an educated boy, who had a child and a wife, very respectful of his parents, he said in Dari, a language spoken in Afghanistan, according to a translation from The New York Times. I dont know what caused this, he said. I did not know and did not understand that he has anger in his heart. Only God can punish homosexuality. This is not an issue for humans to punish. The father told NBC News on Sunday that the shooting has nothing to do with religion. In an interview, he suggested his son had become enraged at seeing a gay couple kissing during a recent trip to Miami. More than five hours after the shooter was killed, bodies were still inside the club. According to authorities, work at the scene had been complicated by the potential of an explosive device. As night fell, many families of people who were at the club did not know whether their loved ones were killed or hospitalized. Orlando Police began releasing the names of those killed about 14 hours after the shooting. Edward Sotomayor Jr., Stanley Almodovar III, Luis Omar Oscasio-Capo and Juan Ramon Guerrero were the first victims identified. All four were killed, police said. Orlando has established a webpage where officials intend to list victims names once notifications of next of kin have been made. The address is www.cityoforlando.net/victims. The shooting reportedly began around 2 a.m. An officer responded to a call of shots fired at the club. He first engaged the shooter outside of the club, with gunfire exchanged. The man ran back inside Pulse, shot many of those in the bar, and a hostage situation began. Some who were inside the club thought the gunshots were part of a music set. A message on the Pulse Orlando Facebook page at 2:09 a.m. read, Everyone get out of Pulse and keep running. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;!- -&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Law enforcement raided the club at 5 a.m., rescuing approximately 30 hostages. The gunman was reportedly carrying an assault rifle, a handgun and a device, according to Mina. We were dancing by the hip-hop area when I heard shots, bam, bam, bam, and the only thing I could think of was to duck, but I ran out instead, Joel Figueroa, 19, of Orlando, told The New York Times. Everybody was screaming and running toward the front door. I didnt get to see the shooter. A friend of his had been shot three times and taken to a hospital, he said. Christopher Hansen dropped to the floor when he heard gunshots. I just fell down and crawled out, Hansen told the Orlando Sentinel. I helped someone who was on the ground. I wasnt sure if he was dead or alive. Mina Justice told the AP her son Eddie texted her from inside the club. In a video posted to YouTube, Justice said Eddie texted her: Hes coming. Im gonna die. Justice had yet to hear from her son Sunday evening. Sundays death toll far surpassed an attack at Virginia Tech in 2007, where 33 were killed, as well as high-profile attacks at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2013, where 28 died, and a mass shooting that killed 14 in San Bernardino, Calif., last December. President Obama alluded to these tragedies and others in a fresh call for action on new gun control measures. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, in a house of worship, or in a movie theater or in a nightclub, Obama said. And we have to decide if thats the kind of country we want to be. To actively do nothing is a decision as well. Mateen, 29, was from Port St. Lucie. He was a U.S. citizen, but some of his family members are not. Grayson would not say where the family is from, but several media outlets have reported they are from Afghanistan. Get Free Local News Alerts for Your Town - Right to Your Inbox ATF confirmed to the press Sunday afternoon that Mateen purchased a handgun and long gun within the last few days. FBI agent Ron Hopper told the media Sunday morning that the suspect may have leanings toward extreme Islamic ideologies. NBC News reported Mateen called 911 just before the shooting and swore allegiance to the head of the Islamic State. The Islamic State news agency has just issued a statement that says they are responsible, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said Sunday afternoon. That has not been confirmed. Security firm G4S confirmed Mateen has been employed with the company for more than eight years. We are cooperating fully with all law enforcement authorities, including the FBI, as they conduct their investigation, G4S said in a statement.

Blood donation centers in the Orlando area were full of people ready to donate for the dozens in need, with officials encouraging folks to come back over the next few days. LGBT organization Equality Florida has established a fundraiser to support victims of the shooting. The shooting at the gay bar took place during LGBT pride month, celebrated each year in June. There was a reportedly unrelated arrest in Santa Monica, Calif., where a man was found with assault weapons and explosive materials, possibly meant for the Los Angeles Pride Festival on Sunday, authorities said. The mass shooting in Orlando has led to an increased police presence for Pride events in Boston, Detroit and Washington, D.C., on Sunday. We will not be deterred by hate as we gather to celebrate love, said D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. Gay bars have been targets for attacks in the past, most notably a bomb attack at an Atlanta club in 1997. Marco Guinette, of Massachusetts, owns the MB Lounge in Worcester. Im appalled, and they are saying its a terrorist attack, which is unfortunately a sad thing this country is dealing with all over the place, Guinette told Patch. Now, being the owner of the MB, it frightens me to know that now I really have to watch closely. You just dont know what will come up. Its just horrific these people died.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, referenced attacks in Paris in November. Coordinated terrorist attacks there left 130 dead, with the majority of those killed at a concert hall. This attack is so painfully reminiscent of the terrible attack at the Bataclan Theatre in Paris and other ISIS-inspired attacks in recent years, Schiff noted. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said his community needs to stand strong and support the victims and their families. We have a strong, resilient community, he said. Tonight, we had a crime that will have a lasting impact on our community.

Just before 7 a.m. Friday, July 13, deputies were called to a home in the 1900 block of Colonial Cove to investigate a report of the kidnapping of three children from their guardian. It was reported that the three female children, twins age five and a two-year-old had been taken at gunpoint by their mother who then fled in a silver Buick SUV. (For more updates on this story and free news alerts for your neighborhood, sign up for your local Patch morning newsletter.) Deputies learned that the night before the kidnapping DHR had removed the children from the custody of their mother as part of a safety plan while an investigation was conducted into abuse allegations. The children were placed with a relative who lived on Colonial Cove. The relative reported that she had been loading the children into her car when Brown pulled up and demanded the children. When the relative tried to stop her from taking the children, Brown pointed a handgun at her. Sheriffs Youth Services detectives and personnel from the Metro Area Crime Center began working on locating the children. A lookout was immediately issued to surrounding law enforcement agencies for Brown and the vehicle. At about 2 p.m. Friday, acting on information developed by the Metro Area Crime Center, deputies located Brown at a hotel in Fairfield. She fled in the vehicle with the children. After a brief pursuit, Brown wrecked striking a car and then a Sheriffs Office SUV. The children were rescued unharmed. Brown was taken to the Jefferson County Jail to await formal charges. On July 16, detectives obtained arrest warrants formally charging her with three counts of Kidnapping, Assault 2nd Degree, Attempting to Elude, and four counts of Reckless Endangerment.

510,"UPDATE 2:30PM- The Solano County Sheriffs Office confirms investigators are now focusing their efforts for locating missing teen Pearl Pinson in Sonoma County. According to Solano County Deputy Sheriff Christine Castillo, Solano investigators are coordinating with the Sonoma County Sheriffs Office to conduct a search in the Willow Creek Rd area near Jenner. The current search is based on information the sheriffs office received during the investigation according to Castillo. No further information was available at this time. ---------------------------------------- UPDATE 2:15PM- ABC7 News is reporting investigators are focusing their efforts for locating missing teen Pearl Pinson in Sonoma County near the city of Jenner. #DEVELOPING @SolanoSheriff now saying they are looking for missing teen #PearlPinson near Jenner in Sonoma County. pic.twitter.com/Z84vnQhwnn ------------------------------ (original story) SOLANO COUNTY - An Amber Alert remains in effect Friday for 15-year-old Pearl Pinson, as police now refocus their search efforts to include southern California. Detectives are currently going through tips and leads that have come in overnight, according to Solano County Deputy Sheriff Christine Castillo. Pinson went missing Thursday morning in the area of Home Acres and Taylor Ave of Vallejo, at the I-780 pedestrian over-crossing, after she was reportedly seen stained with blood as she was allegedly dragged by the suspect in the case, 19-year old Fernando Castro. A witness reported seeing a Hispanic man with a gun allegedly pulling a white female, who was bleeding and yelling for help, on the over-crossing, according to Castillo. The witness claimed he heard a gunshot while running for help. Deputies found blood on the ground, Castillo said. At the time, Solano County authorities said they believed Pinson and Castro were acquaintances, and the case was not a stranger abduction. Investigators also said they did not believe Pinson went willingly with Castro. Castro was killed late Thursday afternoon after a fiery gun battle with police at a mobile home park in Solvang, hundreds of miles south. Police say the vehicle Castro was allegedly driving was spotted in San Luis Obispo County, where the California Highway Patrol and Santa Barbara County Sheriffs deputies chased the vehicle into Santa Barbara County, and to the Solvang location. Police say Pearl Pinson was not in the vehicle. At this point Pearl Pinson was not found, Solano County Sheriff Thomas Ferrara said. We continue to look for her and we are very worried about her safety.

511,"The states highest court has denied an appeal from a Dedham man convicted of beating and kidnapping his girlfriend. The states Supreme Judicial Court ruled against William Oberle, who was convicted of three counts of assault and battery and kidnapping. All the charges stemmed from 2014 domestic violence incidents. Oberle argued that the trial judge erred in his peremptory challenge of a female juror and in admitting prior bad act evidence, according to the courts ruling. The defendant also argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his kidnapping conviction. The court rejected the entirety of Oberles argument. We are unpersuaded, and affirm that conviction, the courts ruling read. Oberle and victim started a romantic relationship in 2013, but things started to go downhill after the victim said Oberle made her uncomfortable and stopped her from looking at and speaking with other people in public. In February 2014, the victim was treated at a hospital for injuries. She said Oberle strangled her and said he was going to kill her. The two later reconciled and moved into Oberles daughters home in Dedham, living in the basement of the house. Following a stable period, the abuse began again, most notably with a July 4, 2014 incident. Oberle and victim got into an argument over the victims bank card because Oberle refused to return it and the victim took it as a sign that he was again using drugs, according to court documents. Following the argument, Oberle left and the victim drank several beers at home before going to bed. When Oberle returned to the house after midnight, he punched the victims face, chest, and legs and held her down and choked her, saying he would kill her. The victim was unable to call for help because the Oberle had taken her cell phone the day before. The victim lost consciousness for an unspecified period of time and when she woke up, the defendant was still on top of her, shouting, with his hands around her neck. The victim did not know how she got away or how much time had passed, but remembered that there was daylight when she ran out the back door of the basement and across the street and hid in the garage of a rental car business, where she waited for the business to open so she could call police. Oberle was arrested on July 6 and indicted on Sept. 14, 2014. Image via Shutterstock",1

He is also charged with domestic assault by strangulation, a felony with a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $5,000 fine. According to the criminal complaint, signed by St. Louis Park Police Officer Aaron Balvin, police were called to a home in the 1300 block of Jersey Avenue just after 7:30 p.m. Nov. 8 on a report of a domestic assault and a kidnapping. The mother of the 1-year-old kidnapping victim told police that she used to date Rutledge, the childs father, and she has full custody of the child. She said she and the child were with Rutledge earlier in the day, and they began arguing. On their way back to the womans apartment, she told police, Rutledge said, Before I let you get [the child] back, I will kill both of us.

518,"A man who shot and injured two police officers before barricading himself in a Fremont home last week, prompting an hours-long standoff with law enforcement, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, according to the Alameda County coroners bureau. Authorities found San Jose resident Gerald Villabrille Jr., 44, dead Thursday after they shot tear gas into the house for the second time during the standoff, causing the home to catch fire. Villabrille had refused to come out of the house on Roberts Avenue for hours after he ran from a nearby traffic stop Wednesday afternoon. Villabrille allegedly shot two officers at separate locations as he was fleeing from police. One of the wounded officers, a relatively new officer shot during the initial traffic stop, remains in critical condition, police said Sunday. The other, a detective with 10 years of experience, was shot about 10 minutes later. The detective remains in stable condition and is recovering, according to police. The incident began at 1:33 p.m. Wednesday when the first officer stopped a reported stolen truck on Fremont Boulevard near Washington Boulevard. The truck had been reported stolen, but investigators do not yet know whether the officer knew that at the time he pulled the vehicle over. After the truck pulled over, the driver backed into a patrol car and there was an exchange of gunfire, critically wounding the first officer. The driver then pulled forward again and three people ran from the traffic stop. Police chased the gunman through a nearby store and caught up with him about 10 minutes later in a backyard of the home on Roberts Avenue. Gunfire was exchanged again and the detective was injured. Hundreds of law enforcement officers from local agencies swarmed the neighborhood to search for the suspects. SWAT teams searched door-to-door and yard-to-yard. Helicopters and drones searched for the suspects by air. At about 11:15 p.m., the team concluded that the suspect was hiding in the same house where the second shooting had happened in the backyard after he got inside by shooting out the locks of the back door. SWAT teams surrounded the home and officers tried to communicate with him over a loudspeaker, but he didnt answer, so they shot tear gas into the house. The barricaded suspect then called 911 and told the officers he had a woman hostage, a claim authorities eventually determined was false. Meanwhile, they continued talking to the suspect, who told them he was armed and dangerous and potentially suicidal. The suspect again cut off negotiations, so officers used gas a second time in the early morning. This time, the gas ignited a small fire inside the home. Firefighters working with a SWAT team tried to put the fire out, but were unable to go inside because the suspect remained barricaded. Authorities continued trying to negotiate his surrender, but he refused to come out, and eventually flames consumed the home and the officers lost contact with him again. By dawn, the home had burned to the ground. There, police found the suspect dead in a closet and recovered the gun believed to have been used in the shootings. --Bay City News",0

523,"Jefferson Township is currently home to 16 registered sex offenders, making it sixth most on the list of Morris County municipalities. Through an Open Public Records Act request, Patch obtained town-by-town statistics regarding the number of registered sex offenders residing in each Morris County municipality, now 20 years after a landmark bill was signed into law. The county, with a total of 292 registered sex offenders, is led by Dover with 41.  Jefferson Townships 16 accounts for 5.5-percent of the countys total. In front of Jefferson is Parsippany, Mt. Olive, Morristown, and Roxbury. Jefferson is tied with Rockaway Township. Numbers varied by county throughout the state, with Essex leading all 21 counties claiming 522 registered sex offenders as residents. Morris County is in the top half of the states counties, ranking fifth overall. According to the New Jersey State Police, Hunterdon County has the least number of registered sex offenders with just 27. On Oct. 31, 1994, sex offender registration and community notification provisions were signed into law under the name of Megans Law. Less than seven years later, on July 23, 2001, that law expanded and became required for registration on the Internet as well. Megans Law came about after Megan Kanka, a seven-year-old girl, was raped and murdered by a neighbor in Hamilton Township, Mercer County in July of 1994. That neighbor, Jesse Timmendequas, was previously convicted of sexually assaulting a five-year-old girl and seven-year-old girl. Timmendequas was convicted of first degree murder, kidnapping, and four aggravated sexual assault crimes of Kanka. He was sentenced to the death penalty, but reverted back to life in prison without parole after New Jersey abolished the death penalty in 2007 while he sat on death row. In Morris County the list of each towns number of registered sex offenders is as follows: Dover: 41Parsippany: 22Mount Olive: 19Morristown: 19Roxbury: 17Jefferson: 16Rockaway Township: 16Rockaway Borough: 14Butler: 11Boonton: 10Denville: 9Montville: 9Mount Arlington: 8Morris Township: 8Lincoln Park: 8Hanover: 7Washington Township: 6Greystone Park: 5Wharton: 5Randolph: 4Kinnelon: 4East Hanover: 4Florham Park: 3Madison: 3Mendham Township: 3Netcong: 3Pequannock: 3Boonton Township: 2Chatham Borough: 2Chatham Township: 2Chester Township: 2Long Hill Township: 2Victory Gardens: 2Riverdale: 1Chester Borough: 0Harding: 0Mendham Borough: 0Morris Plains: 0Mountain Lakes: 0 Registration under Megans Law comes from convictions under a wide scope of crimes, according to the New Jersey State Police. Also, those not found guilty by reason of insanity are also required to register. The crimes include aggravated sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, kidnapping in conjunction with a sex crime, endangering the welfare of a child by engaging in sexual conduct, luring or enticing, and knowingly promoting prostitution of a child. Megans Law is similarly known at the federal level as the Sexual Offender Act, which was created in 1994, and requires anyone convicted of a sex crime against children to notify local law enforcement of any change of address or employment after release from custody.",0

Two of the suspects, 26-year-old Manuel Ayala, of San Jose, and 26-year-old Crystal Pajimola, of Mountain House near Tracy, have been charged with premeditated attempted murder, kidnapping with intent to rob and attempted robbery of the boy, Deputy District Attorney Carolyn Malinsky said. The third suspect, Ralph Hamby, 28, of Milpitas, is to be arraigned on Monday in Superior Court in San Jose on the three charges and will face additional charges of shooting into an inhabited dwelling and two counts of assault with a firearm, Malinsky said. Pajimola was arraigned at the Hall of Justice on Thursday and Ayala was formally charged there this afternoon, she said. According to prosecutors and Santa Clara police, just before midnight on Monday, Pajimola called the 15-year-old victim, a busboy with whom she worked, and asked to meet him at his apartment in Santa Clara. After the juvenile emerged from the apartment, as Pajimola stood by, Hamby allegedly attacked the boy, struck him in the head with a handgun, demanded money and dragged him into the street, according to Malinsky. As the boy pleaded with Hamby not to hurt him, Hamby then fired three shots at the teen, striking him once in the leg and shattering the boys thigh bone. Hamby also pointed his gun at two witnesses and fired several rounds into the boys apartment. He then fled the scene in a car with Pajimola that was being driven by Ayala, prosecutors said. The boy survived but doctors had to implant a metal rod into his leg. Santa Clara police arrested the suspects separately this week and located a handgun believed used in the shooting in some bushes.

532,"Oregon State Trooper Nic Cederberg, who was shot multiple times by a homicide suspect who was killed in the Christmas Day exchange, spoke for the first time since the incident on Wednesday. It happened after his third surgery in as many days. Tonight Nic was able to talk to us for the first time, his brother Jeff wrote on a GoFundMe page set up to help the family. He was pretty emotional and sincerely thanked each and every doctor, nurse, and all of the support staff for saving his life. He even apologized for the foul language and promised that he would work on it. Jeff wrote that his brothers condition is improving by the hour, and most of the major repair work has been addressed. The hospital staff claim he is one of the toughest guys theyve seen come through the ICU in quite some time. As of 9:45 Thursday morning, nearly 600 people had donated $46,877 to the Cederberg family though the fundraising page. Earlier in the day, before he was able to speak, Jeff Cederberg said that his brother had spelled out did my job to his family, gave his wife a gentle high-five and gave his three-month-old nephew a fist bump. State Police say that Cederberg, 32, was shot several times by 30-year-old James Tylka, whom they believe had just killed his wife. Cederberg is a seven-year veteran of the State Police assigned to North Plains. He previously served in the United States Army. We consider Nic Cederberg a hero, said Oregon State Police Spokesman Capt. Bill Fugate at a press conference on Tuesday. He undoubtedly saved the lives of members of the community and other police officers. He has a long road of recovery ahead of him. This is the second time that Cederberg has been involved in a shooting while on duty. In October 2015, he and another trooper were involved in a shootout with Andrew DeHart on Highway 26. DeHart fired 99 times while Cederberg and his partner fired 32 times. DeHart, who had been wanted on attempted murder and kidnapping charges, was not hit but later shot and killed himself. Officials say that the situation started Sunday afternoon when Tylkas wife, Kate Armand — they were separated and in the process of divorcing — dropped their 11-month-old daughter off at the house he shares with his parents. Tylka then followed Armand outside the house. He then shot and killed her. He fled the scene, leaving officers from the state police, Hillsboro, Tigard, Sherwood and Tualatin on the chase that ended with Cederberg being shot, Tylka being killed. The Washington County Major Crimes Team is leading the investigation of Armands murder, the shooting of Cederberg and death of Tylka. From 2004-2006, Tylka had been in the Beaverton Police Cadet Program, a since-disbanded volunteer program that encouraged people 16-21 to learn more about the police. The cadets were never armed. In June, he and Armand filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy citing more than $164,000 in debt with only $20,574 in assets. That filing indicated he had been working as an account executive for Comcast. Tylka also had a son from a previous marriage. His wife filed for sole custody earlier this fall, saying their son was in immediate danger. Tylka had also gone through voluntary bankruptcy with his previous wife in 2001 and 2002, according to court records. People looking to assist Cederbergs family can do so several ways, according to the State Police. email: OSP.social@state.or.us mail: Oregon State Police Attention: Trooper Cederberg 3565 Trelstad Ave SE SALEM, OR 97317 Donations can also be made through the Oregon State Police Officers Association website.

534,"Long Beach police today released composite drawings of a man and woman wanted in the kidnapping and killing of a 3-week-old girl and the shooting and wounding of her parents and uncle in North Long Beach. The abduction of Eliza De La Cruz and the shootings of her family members occurred about 5:50 p.m. Jan. 3 at the familys home in the 100 block of West 51st Street. The infants body was found the following afternoon in a trash bin at a commercial strip mall in the 600 block of Palm Drive in Imperial Beach. Officers found the shooting victims after being sent to the familys home on reports of gunfire. The girls father was treated and released, but her mother and uncle had to be hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries. Detectives say they believe the family was targeted, but arent sure why. And at this point in the investigation, a connection between the victims and suspects has yet to be determined, a police statement said. Investigators learned that the mother and her daughter got off a bus at Del Amo and Long Beach boulevards about 90 minutes before the crime. While walking home, a black SUV with large black rims -- possibly a 2006 to 2011 Range Rover -- pulled up next to them, and the female driver stopped and inquired about the victims baby, police said. After a brief verbal exchange, the victim walked home. Later that day, a male suspect ... forced his way into the victims home, shooting three adults and kidnapping baby Eliza. Police released composite drawings of the gunman and the woman driving the SUV. The gunman was described only as being black or Hispanic with dark skin. The woman was described as black, about 40 years old and heavyset, with long, curly black hair. Detectives also released security video showing the SUV following the bus before the mother and daughter got off, and also showing the mother walking down the street with her baby after getting off the bus. A $25,000 reward has been offered by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case.

535,"The man who pleaded guilty to killing an Iowa sheriffs deputy during a jail escape was sentenced to life in prison with no chance for parole and apologized to the deputys family, saying he liked the officer and didnt intend to kill him. Wesley Correa-Carmenaty was sentenced Tuesday after changing his pleas to guilty to first-degree murder, attempted murder, escape, kidnapping and other crimes. His trial was slated to begin Tuesday, but his attorney informed authorities last week that Correa-Carmenaty would change his plea in Pottawattamie County District Court in Council Bluffs. The reason for the sentence is pretty simple — to guarantee that the defendant will spend the rest of his life in prison, Judge James Heckerman said. Its clear... that hes an extreme threat to society. Correa-Carmenaty, who used a Spanish interpreter, showed little emotion throughout the hearing, smiling and nodding as he entered pleas to each count. (For more information on this and other Iowa stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.)  Correa-Carmenaty was sentenced May 1 to 45 years in prison in an unrelated murder case and was being taken from the courthouse to the Pottawattamie County Jail when the fatal assault occurred, officials said. Correa-Carmenaty was in handcuffs and leg shackles as he was being transported in a jail van, but managed to unlock them by the time the van reached the jail, authorities said. Pottawattamie County Attorney Matthew Wilber explained publicly for the first time in court Tuesday that Correa-Carmenaty managed to unlock the shackles by hiding a handcuff key obtained from another inmate in his hair. He was also armed with a handmade shank formed from a toothbrush, which he used to slash Deputy Mark Burbridge in the face, neck and arms during the attack, then managed to get into the cab of the van and grab a service weapon, killing Burbridge and wounding Deputy Pat Morgan. Burbridge died and Morgan survived. Wilber said Correa-Carmenaty took both deputies guns, ammunition and the keys to the van, then drove the transport van through a jail garage door, abandoning it a few blocks away. He tried to carjack a truck, shooting and wounding a man inside it, then carjacked a woman and drove across the state border into Omaha, Nebraska, where he let the woman go, authorities said. He was arrested there a short time later after crashing during a high-speed chase with police Three of Burbridges children spoke at the hearing, each of them labeling Correa-Carmenaty a monster, and fighting tears as they described their father as a loving parent. Correa-Carmenaty apologized to Burbridges family, saying he had liked Burbridge. In reality, I liked him. He was one of the people who would ask you, How is your case going? he said through the interpreter, who appeared to be fighting her own emotions as she relayed Correa-Carmenatys words. It was not intentional. I was trying to escape.

536,"You cant help but notice how often its in the news -- incidents of abductions, attempted abductions and missing kids. In July, from a lake not far from their homes in Evansdale, their bikes left in the grass as if theyd just stepped away for a few minutes. Almost two months later, theres still no sign of them. And its not just happening in other cities. Its happening here at home, too. Just last spring in Waukee, a as they headed home from a neighborhood park. Then, just a few weeks ago, a man emerged from a van to try and while she waited at the bus stop. He was unsuccessful. Come Wednesday, central Iowans will quietly remember one of the most high-profile missing child cases in our states history -- 30 years have passed since Johnny Gosch disappeared while delivering newspapers near his West Des Moines home. How Waukee Responds Mackenzie Sposeto, a police officer with the Waukee Police Department and school resource officer with the Waukee Community Schools, knows better than some how scary the idea of a missing child can be. Sposeto, a mother of three, is usually one of the first people on the case when a child is reported missing. She sees the upset moms and the anxious dads as they try to work out where their son or daughter could be or who might have a clue to their whereabouts. Its all about communication, says Sposeto. As soon as its confirmed that that child was not in class or didnt show up somewhere when they say they would, we make sure that we start gathering information. When was the last time they were seen? Who was the last person to talk to them? What were they wearing? Where could they have gone? And the reaction these days is immediate. No longer do worried parents have to wait 48 hours before filing a missing person report. In fact, Sposeto said, if its a juvenile, police get right on it. Every minute that goes by that a child is away from their home and their family is precious. When we have a child thats missing ... you have a window of time that you have a better possibility to get that child home safe. Otherwise, there becomes this gap and anyone will tell you, you have to get on it. You have to bring this child home safe. Thankfully, Sposeto said, the department has rarely had to use its missing child procedures. Periodically, a parent will call to report that their son or daughter never made it home from school only to find that they stopped off at the neighbors to play ball or watch TV with a friend. But otherwise, no missing child cases here. Weve been lucky in that we havent had any big missing person cases, she said. On occasion well get that call that, my kid didnt come home from school, or my kid didnt come home last night, but weve been blessed to always find those kids right away.",0

Police also gave the following tips for keeping children safe. Things to Keep Your Children Safe: 1. Teach your child(ren) your address and phone number, including the area code. Instruct your child(ren) on how to use the telephone to call home, and in an emergency, 911. 2. Keep an updated file on your child, including a photograph and physical description. If your child is under two years of age, you should update the information at least four times each year. 3. Pay close attention to the clothing your child is wearing each day and never display your childs name on his/or clothes or books. Children will often respond to strangers who call them by name. 4. Make sure your child knows what to do should you become separated in a public place. Your child should immediately make a report to a facility employee and should not attempt to search for you. 5. Select a secret code word that only you and your child know. Tell your child never to go with anyone who does not know this code. 6. Keep a set of your childs footprints, fingerprints and dental records. 7. Leave instructions with your childs school to notify you immediately if he/she is absent and provide them with written information on which people are authorized to pick your child up after school. 8. Educate your children on the many tactics used by abductors to lure them away. Teach them to immediately leave the area if a stranger is present. If your child is grabbed, instruct your child to yell fire (or stranger) People are more likely to respond to those shouts than to cries of help. 9. Survey the recreation and school routes your child uses. Point out any dangerous areas such as vacant lots, alleyways, busy streets, etc. Teach your child what to do should he/she be followed. 10. Join or organize a safe home program with your neighbors to establish secure homes where your children can go for help. Patch will update readers as more information becomes available.

550,"Carlsbad, CA — A babysitter and her boyfriend accused in the sexual molestation of two 7-year-old North County San Diego girls were ordered held on $2.6 million bail Friday. Samuel Cabrera Jr., 22, of Carlsbad, and Brittney Mae Lyon, of Escondido, also 22 years old, were arrested Wednesday by Carlsbad police, who said Lyon, the girls babysitter, brought them on multiple occasions to Cabreras residence, where he allegedly molested them while she purportedly videotaped the acts. During their arraignments Friday at San Diego Superior Court in Vista, both pleaded not guilty to eight felony charges, including conspiracy, forcible child molest and kidnapping for child molest, according to Deputy District Attorney Jodi Breton. Breton said that in addition to Lyon furnishing the victims, on some occasions she helped undress them, the Los Angeles Time reported. Cabrera and Lyon were taken into custody less than 24 hours after the Carlsbad Police Department learned of the alleged crimes and launched a full-scale investigation, serving search warrants and collecting evidence. Investigators believe the girls were sexually molested on multiple occasions at Cabreras Carlsbad residence in the 6300 block of Greenhaven Drive. We had a 7-year-old female report to her mother that she didnt want to go to the babysitters, because the babysitters used to bring her over to Sams house, Carlsbad Police Lt. Marc Reno told NBC7 San Diego. Breton said the two young victims — one lives with her family in Oceanside and the other lives in Escondido — did not know each other; one was a family friend of Lyons, according to the Times. Lyons Facebook profile lists several employment positions in North County that would have put her in the direct company of children. She worked as an inclusion leader at a YMCA in Oceanside, as an instructional aide at San Elijo Elementary School in San Marcos and as a camp program leader at a YMCA in Escondido, her profile shows. She studied child development at Cal State San Marcos and also listed Legoland as one of her employers. One of the victims was described by Breton as very developmentally delayed and therefore unable to communicate what happened to her, the Times reported. We are equally disturbed and outraged that adults would victimize children in this way ... the safety and welfare of children are our top priority, Carlsbad police Chief Neil Gallucci said at the time of their arrests. The pair — who each face more than 90 years to life in prison if convicted, according to Breton — are scheduled to appear in court again July 19 for a readiness conference, and July 21 for preliminary hearing. Lyon was initially held on $100,000 bail and Cabreras was set at $2.3 million. But Friday, San Diego Superior Court Judge James Magione ordered each held at $2.6 million bail, saying they were both a substantial risk to public safety, the Times reported. — City News Service contributed to this report.",1

Search Warrants:  Chemical Tests (SB 717, DeSaulnier): This amendment to current law authorizes the issuance of a search warrant to draw blood from a person in a reasonable, medically approved manner, to show that the person violated misdemeanor DUI provisions when that person has refused an officers request to submit to, or has failed to complete, a blood test.

552,"All five suspects in a brutal hazing at Wheaton College have been given permission to leave the state by a DuPage County judge. The accused players —all of whom live outside of Illinois— all posted $5,000 in bail and were released immediately after turning themselves in last month. The players were handed down multiple charges, including mob action and unlawful restraint after they allegedly beat, kidnapped, and sexually threatened a freshman in a 2016 incident. The accused players are Noah R. Spielman, 21, of Columbus, Ohio, Kyler S. Kregel, 21, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, Samuel Tebos, 22, of Allendale, Michigan, Benjamin W. Pettyway, 21, of Mount Georgia, and James W. Cooksey, 22, of Jacksonville, Florida. Shortly after the charges were handed down, Spielmans lawyer held a press conference saying his client was surprised the incident had resurfaced after the Christian school had already taken disciplinary action by making each player write an 8-page essay reflecting on their alleged actions. Judge Brian Telander, who approved the players requests to travel out of state, also issued a gag order preventing Wheaton Police from sharing details about the case with media and school officials, according to Daily Herald. The accused football players are currently suspended from the Wheaton College football team as they await trial.

560,"Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn vowed to a packed auditorium of Seminole Heights residents that city police would not leave the area until a gunman responsible for three deaths is captured. We will hunt this son of a b---- down until we find him, Buckhorn said to thunderous applause. The Seminole Heights neighborhood has been on edge since three people were shot and killed within a mile of each other. Police say they have no motive and the victims did not know each other, but authorities consider the shootings to be related. Police have declined to use the term serial killer, saying they are not sure if the shootings were committed by one person. In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Buckhorn said police are no closer to finding a suspect despite an investigation that began on Oct. 9. He said police dont have a lot to work with right now. This is an unusual case, the mayor said. There is no rhyme or reason other than folks being in the wrong place at the wrong time, in the wrong neighborhood. But we will catch him. This person will make a mistake, Buckhorn said Tuesday. City officials held a meeting Monday night at Edison Elementary School to provide answers about efforts to solve the shootings and soothe any concerns of residents.

We will find this person doing this, and we will prosecute them,he said. Dugan added: There is a very good likelihood that someone in this room knows who is doing this. Anthony Naiboa, the latest victim, was a 20-year-old Middleton High School graduate who was shot and killed on a sidewalk at N 15th and E. Conover streets on Thursday. Prior to Naiboas death, 22-year-old Benjamin Edward Mitchell and 32-year-old Monica Hoffa were found shot to death. Mitchell died on Oct. 9 and Hoffas body was found on Oct. 13. The shootings occurred within an 11-day period. The one bit of evidence police have released is a surveillance video of a thin person wearing a hood walking along a neighborhood street at the time of the first shooting on Oct. 9. The person, who appears to be a man, has not been called a suspect, but police have said they want to speak with him. The video can be viewed here. Police say they brought in two people who they believed might be the person in the video. They were questioned and later released. The meeting opened with a moment of silence for the victims. Then Buckhorn launched into a fiery speech, telling the crowd we are not leaving until we catch this guy. We will not let evil win this. We will not be held hostage. This is our house. Evil will not win. Not now, not ever! Buckhorn said. Buckhorn said that for Tampa police, this is personal. After uttering his expletive in the Edison school auditorium, Buckhorn joked: I may not be allowed back in this elementary (school). Police have saturated the area in recent days, looking for clues and talking with residents. You cant get five feet out there without seeing a police car, the mayor said. Buckhorn said he was proud of the communitys response to the shootings. Residents have marched in the streets, vowing not to be afraid. We need you to turn those lights on. We need you to be visible. We need you to tell us what you see, the mayor said. The community meeting ended with a prayer. Goodness is going to win, Buckhorn said. Images from gofundme.com",0
561,"Image: Jesse Matthew (Fairfax County Police Department) Jesse Matthew, the Charlottesville man accused of sexually assaulting a Fairfax City woman in 2005, entered an Alford plea to the charges Wednesday, according to media reports. He entered the plea during his trial in Fairfax Circuit Court on three charges: attempted capital murder, abduction and sexual assault. The charges stem from the decade-old case in which a woman walking home from a local grocery store was abducted and molested, according to media reports. In an Alford plea, a criminal defendant claims innocence, but acknowledges that prosecutors have enough evidence to convict him. Before the trial, Matthew had pleaded not guilty to the charges. His move on Wednesday means the jury will not decide on a verdict or sentence, effectively ending the trial. Judge David Schell accepted the plea deal, and Matthew became a convicted rapist. Matthew, 33, entered the Alford plea to all three charges, each of which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Schell is scheduled to sentence Matthew on Oct. 2, radio station WTOP reported. The victim traveled from India with two small children to testify at a pretrial hearing Thursday. On Monday, she testified at the trial about the sexual assault, describing that September night in frightening detail. But she did not explicitly identify Matthew as the assailant, according to media reports. The plea deal came at midday, after prosecutors rested their case against Matthew, according to WRC-TV Channel 4. In testimony earlier Wednesday, a forensic scientist said that DNA evidence found under one of the victims fingernails linked Matthew to the crime. Matthew also has been linked by DNA evidence to the killing of Hannah Graham, a University of Virginia student. Graham vanished in September, and her remains were found about five weeks later. In that case, Matthew faces charges in Albemarle County of capital murder, first-degree murder and abduction with intent to defile. A trial has not been scheduled.",1
562,"Four men from Prince Georges County and Charles County in Maryland were charged with armed robbery after a police officer interrupted a transaction in progress Monday in the Little River Run Shopping Center in Annandale. Marion Kenneth Allen, Jr., 22, Cye Adam Penn, 22, Bryant Robinson, 19, and Xavier Hall, 22 were charged with robbery, use of a firearm in commission of a felony and abduction, according to a news release from the Fairfax County Police Department. A 15-year-old boy placed an ad online advertising Nike tennis shoes for sale and agreed to meet a buyer at the shopping center around 10:50 p.m. on Monday, according to the news release. A police officer on patrol in the shopping center, at the 7400 block of Little River Turnpike, spotted a suspicious car in the parking lot without its lights on. The teen signaled to an officer, from the passenger seat of the vehicle, that he needed help. The officer discovered there was a gun in the car and performed a high-risk stop, which according Lucy Caldwell, the FCPD Public Information spokesperson, occurs when additonal officers are called to the scene often due to the presence of a weapon. Following the stop, all four suspects were taken into custody. FCPD warns all residents using online services to be cautious during transactions when buying or selling products by meeting during daylight hours, never alone, and in a public place.

564,"The former person of interest in the Seminole Heights shootings is now considered a suspect, Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan said Wednesday. At an afternoon press conference, the police chief showed a video taken moments before Tuesdays shooting and near the crime scene. Dugan said police believe it is the same person shown in a video taken in the area where the first shooting occurred on Oct. 9 . Benjamin Mitchell was shot and died from his wounds. The new video can be viewed here. Police are not releasing the exact location of where the latest video was taken. Dugan said police dont believe it is a coincidence that the same person was in the area of Tuesday mornings shooting and the Oct. 9 shooting. We need to know who this person is, Dugan said. We dont need speculation. We dont need profiles. We need names, he said. He said police believe the killer lives in the neighborhood because the suspect has avoided capture. Whoever is doing it, theyre familiar with the neighborhood and theyre able to vanish very quickly, Dugan said. On Tuesday, Ronald Felton, an unemployed construction worker who was on his way to volunteer at a food bank, was gunned down on Nebraska Avenue about 5 a.m. Police arrived at the shooting scene within minutes, but the suspect escaped. Police say Feltons death is linked to three other killings in the neighborhood last month. Despite a door-to-door search by Tampa police and four other law enforcement agencies, the suspect avoided capture. One possible break in the case, police have a witness who gave a description of the suspect. The suspect was described as a black male with a thin build and light complexion, 6-foot to 6-foot-2, dressed in all black and wearing a black baseball cap. The suspect was armed with a large black pistol, police said. Police said they are continuing to follow leads in the previous three murders. The fourth shooting death occurred blocks away from a memorial for the three previous Seminole Heights homicide victims. Police have asked residents and businesses to review their surveillance cameras and share the video with detectives. After Tuesdays shooting, police received more than 450 tips, with the total number of tips now more than 2,300. Also, about two dozen detectives are going through hours of surveillance video already obtained from residents and businesses. Mayor Bob Buckhorn said the Seminole Heights neighborhood is being held hostage by the killer. This was a very decent neighborhood until the last couple of months, sighed Sherry Street, 50, a cook who has lived in the area for seven years. Up until recently I used to accidentally fall asleep with the door unlocked. Street told the Associated Press she has stopped walking to the store, taking the bus or sitting outside to smoke at night. Her friends would often stop by and hang out on her porch to talk, but now theyre like, Im not coming to see you. Her neighbors have also changed their routines. At 7 oclock you can come out this door and you wont hear a sound, she said. It had been nearly a month since the last deadly shooting on Oct. 19. All three shootings took place within a 15 block area. A former FBI investigator told Bay News 9 that the gap in shootings could be a cooling off period and said it is typical behavior of criminal predators and serial killers. Theyll conduct some of the crimes, and then lay low for a while, and then potentially come back, and that is indicative of a serial killer, said Dave Couvertier. Dugan has avoided using the term serial killer to describe the suspect despite police saying all four shootings were random. The Seminole Heights neighborhood has been on edge since the three shooting deaths occurred last month in the span of 11 days. Police say they have no motive, but authorities consider the three shootings to be related. The first victim, Mitchell, 22, was waiting at the Route 9 bus stop on 15th Street on his way to see his girlfriend when he was shot. The body of Monica Hoffa, 32, was found on Oct. 13. Anthony Naiboa, a 20-year-old Middleton High School graduate, was shot and killed on a sidewalk at N 15th and E. Conover streets on Oct. 19. Hoffa, a waitress at a local IHOP, was walking to a friends home when she was shot. Her body was found in a vacant lot. Naiboa had mistakenly taken the wrong bus to return home from work and was walking to a bus stop on 15th Street when he was shot about 8 p.m. on Oct. 19. A reward of $91,000 is being offered for information leading to the arrest of the suspect.

566,"The Board of Supervisors today approved a $5 million settlement for the family of an aspiring TV producer who was taken hostage in West Hollywood and then killed by sheriffs deputies who mistook him for a suspect. John Winkler, 30, was shot and killed on April 7, 2014, by deputies responding to a report of a man with a knife at an apartment complex. A federal lawsuit filed on behalf of Winklers family alleged that deputies were negligent and used excessive force. The settlement was reached on the one-year anniversary of Winklers death, but the amount was not disclosed until the board approved the payment today. The vote was unanimous. The lawsuit alleged that before the shooting, a woman in the apartment complex showed deputies photos of Alexander McDonald -- the actual suspect -- and Winkler, identifying McDonald as the assailant. One deputy showed the photo of McDonald to other deputies, saying Alex is our guy, according to the suit. Authorities would later say that Winkler was actually being held hostage by the suspect, who was also shot but survived. McDonald is awaiting trial on murder and other charges. During a preliminary hearing for McDonald, his roommate Liam Mulligan testified that he was also shot by sheriffs deputies as he rushed out of the West Hollywood apartment clutching his neck, where he had been stabbed/ A sheriffs sergeant testified that one deputy who opened fire mistakenly assumed that Winkler was using Mulligan as a human shield. The lawsuit, filed in December, sought unspecified damages, naming Los Angeles County, the sheriffs department and three deputies. City News Service",0

568,"Photo via Shutterstock By Bay City News Service A man shot by police last month after allegedly crashing a stolen vehicle near San Francisco International Airport and attempting several carjackings while trying to escape is out of the hospital and was arraigned Friday in Redwood City, prosecutors said. Daniel Frederick, 24, spent three days in the hospital recovering after he was shot in the abdomen by San Francisco police on the morning of July 26, according to the San Mateo County District Attorneys Office. Frederick allegedly stole a Toyota Yaris from the Millbrae BART station at about 6:50 a.m., prosecutors said. San Francisco police Chief Greg Suhr said last week that the cars owner had parked it there while she was running the San Francisco Marathon. A short time later, Frederick crashed the car into a light pole on South Airport Boulevard near the North Access Road to the airport. He walked away from the crash and hid nearby, removing his jacket. He emerged wearing a yellow T-shirt, Suhr said. A motorcycle officer spotted Frederick and stopped to talk to him for a few minutes, Suhr said. He ordered to Frederick to put down a backpack he was carrying, but instead Frederick ran west on San Bruno Avenue. He allegedly jumped into a car stopped at a stoplight nearby and threatened the driver, ordering him to drive away. The motorcycle officer caught up and, thinking the driver might be an accomplice, ordered him at gunpoint not to go anywhere. The driver put his hands up and refused to help the suspect escape, Suhr said. Frederick ran from the car, taking the victims backpack with him. He fled down a dirt road and hid in some bushes along a frontage road near U.S. Highway 101, Suhr said. Several other officers caught up with Frederick in the bushes and ordered him out. Eventually he left the bushes and tried to get into several other cars along the frontage road but was unsuccessful, according to Suhr. An officer again ordered him to stop at gunpoint. Frederick allegedly turned toward the officer and started approaching him. The officer fired one shot but missed, Suhr said. Frederick kept coming at him, approaching to within 6 feet. Other officers nearby heard him saying shoot me as he approached, Suhr said. The officer fired again, striking Frederick in the abdomen. Prosecutors charged Frederick with attempted carjacking, attempted kidnapping, second-degree robbery, vehicle theft, receipt of stolen property, resisting a police officer and hit-and-run. He was assigned an attorney and is due to return to court to enter a plea this Friday. He remains in jail on $750,000 bail, prosecutors said.",0

573,"The California Supreme Court refused Wednesday to review the case against two former Long Beach residents convicted in a human trafficking case in which a young woman was tattooed with the moniker used by one of the men. Lebrette Stacey Winn and Eric Avery were convicted in 2014, with Winn sentenced to 47 years and four months to life in state prison and his co-defendant to 33 years behind bars. Win was convicted of two counts each of pimping and pandering by procuring and one count each of human trafficking to commit another crime, sodomy by use of force, forcible rape, aggravated mayhem and kidnapping. Avery was found guilty of one felony count each of pimping a minor 16 years of age or older and human trafficking of a minor for a sex act. Winn and Avery were arrested in May 2013 after two young women escaped from a locked car and told a passerby that they had been forced into prostitution. The good Samaritan -- who drove the women to a police station -- was subsequently honored last year as a courageous citizen by Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey. Officers found a key to an Inglewood hotel room in Averys pocket that led them to a 16-year-old girl, who said she had been working as a prostitute for him. In June, a three-justice panel from Californias 2nd District Court of Appeal rejected the defendants contention that their trial attorneys rendered ineffective assistance by failing to seek to have their trials severed. The justices also rejected Winns claim that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for aggravated mayhem involving the young woman whose forehead was tattooed with his moniker. The 46-page ruling states that Winn subjected her to a custom-designed tattoo that permanently branded her with either (or both) his pimp nickname or a derogatory epithet marking her as a consumable good. The woman had begun the process of having the tattoo removed at the time of the trial, the appellate court panel noted. — City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",1

Pittman praised the Jamaican community, which provided about 100 DNA samples that were used to identify Matterson. Investigators also used security camera footage from a Hyannis adult novelty store to identify Matterson, according to the Cape Cod Times.

577,"During his 30 years in law enforcement, Palm Harbor resident Danny Mack has witnessed some pretty awful stuff.  He investigated countless cases of child abuse and missing children while working as a cop in the Chicago area. Now, hes trying to raise awareness about organizations dedicated to helping missing children, with a song the recorded about Caylee Anthony, the Florida toddler whose remains were found in a trash bag near her Orlando home. The retiree was inspired to pen, Theres a Brand New Angel after following the cases of two missing Florida children, Jessica Lunsford and Caylee Anthony in the media. It seemed like there was a high frequency of these child abductions, said Mack, who is the father of two grown children. Mack, who also wrote a polka song performed by the Oak Ridge Boys, says his song honoring Caylee Anthony took a while to write. It was cooking in my brain for months and months. Mack says hes not making any money from the recording, its not for sale. His says his motives are purely altruistic. Mack is giving away an MP3 version of the song, with the hope it will inspire people to donate to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children or another organization dedicated to missing children. Someone is going to pay attention to it, and if it motivates them in any way to do something to support any of these wonderful organizations that do so much for missing and exploited children, so be it, he said. The song, which Mack recorded in his own studio, is already getting some attention. He says a college radio station in Springfield, Ma is playing it. Mack has been a musician since he began playing with his father in a band in Chicago at age 13. He continued with his musical passion throughout his life, even during his career in law enforcement. The music business has been very good to me. Mack says his earnings from dabbling in music helped pay for his home. Macks songs have been recorded by southern gospel groups, and he even wrote a song about Paul Bunyan, which the city of Bangor, Maine adopted as its official song. But, Macks song about Caylee Anthony carries a special place in his heart. I feel very fortunate to be able to do this and to have followed that urge to do it, its a good feeling.

582,"- It was dubbed the coldest case ever solved -- but now the search for answers in the 1957 abduction and murder of Sycamore 7-year-old Maria Ridulph goes on. On Wednesday, Seattle resident Jack McCullough was granted a certificate of innocence, one year after his murder conviction was overturned. McCullough, 77, was arrested in 2011 after a tip from a St. Charles resident who was there the day Ridulph was taken. The woman, who was friends with Maria, identified McCullough as the man who had offered the two girls piggyback rides before Maria went missing. The 7-year-olds remains were found months later in Woodbine, Ill., nearly 100 miles away. McCullough was freed in April 2016 after a judge overturned his conviction based on clear and convincing evidence, CNN reported. McCullough had maintained his innocence, insisting that he had been 40 miles from Sycamore in Rockford, Illinois, talking to Air Force recruiters, when Maria was taken. The judges decision spared McCullough a life sentence. McCullough was not in court Wednesday when a DeKalb County judge granted his certificate of innocence, but Marias sister was, according to the Daily Chronicle. Pat Quinn said she still believes McCullough is her sisters killer. This is just disappointment, she told the Chronicle. States Attorney Rick Amato also expressed disappointment, saying Maria, Pat and their brother, Chuck, dont have justice, adding, I did my best to speak for (Maria) – to ask questions we all want to ask – to get answers we all crave. I wanted to be sure Marias voice was heard. McCulloughs attorneys told the Chronicle he is undecided on whether to file a wrongful conviction lawsuit. In November, Illinois State Police said they were investigating a new suspect in the case. Former States Attorney Richard Schmack received an anonymous letter pointing the finger at the new suspect -- whose name has not been released -- the same day the told reporters he believed McCullough had been wrongly convicted, the Chronicle reported.

604,"Two men facing charges for the rape of two women abducted from Catonsville bus stops have been linked to six other violent crimes—and may be responsible for additional crimes, according to Baltimore County Police Chief James Johnson. William Justin Campbell, 25, and Kenyon Travis Waller, 22, are responsible for a crime spree that dates back to at least August 11th of this year and ended when they were apprehended on Oct. 1 and charged with robbery, kidnapping, rape and sexual assault, Johnson said at a press briefing at Baltimore City Police headquarters. Campbell and Waller are two extremely dangerous people who committed violent crimes against eleven victims—mostly young women and students at local colleges, according to Johnson. Sometimes, some of these particular cases just bring outrage to you—outrage in your heart. Baltimore City Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said at the briefing. You have young women here, on their way to school, on their way in a public place, and theyre assaulted by...we cant call the suspects names, Batts said. The things that they did, the way that they treated these young ladies, is an outrage. , a 17-year-old girl on her way home from Community College of Baltimore County Catonsville exited a bus at the intersection of Edmondson and Ingleside avenues, according to police. She was walking to another bus stop when a gold Ford Explorer pulled up beside her, police said. Johnson said that Campbell, who was driving the vehicle, got out and forced the victim into the car. Waller was in the back seat armed with a handgun, he said. The victim was driven to an alley in Baltimore City, where Campbell went through her personal belongings, taking her wallet, cell phone, money and other personal effects, while Waller committed a sexual assault, Johnson said. Later on Oct. 1, Baltimore City police received a report of a robbery and kidnapping of a young man and woman on the 2500 block of Liberty Heights, not far from Baltimore City Community College, according to officials. According to police, the vehicle used during the crime was a gold Ford Explorer. They also had a partial license plate, according to Capt Dan Lioi, commander of district detectives in the city police department. The investigation led to Campbell and Waller, and by 11:20 p.m. they were located and taken into custody, police said. Police also charged Campbell for the Sept. 25 kidnapping and sexual assault of a 18-year-old woman near the Edmondson-Ingleside bus stop. According to police, at around 9:20 a.m., the victim had left the bus and was walking to work when Campbell displayed a semi-automatic handgun and told her to get into his vehicle—a Ford SUV. Campbell drove the victim to a dead-end street in a nearby apartment complex and ordered her to perform a sexual act, according to police. He took her property and threatened to harm her if she contacted police, officials said. The method of operation was very similar, Johnson said. Based on the similarity of the crimes, detectives investigated reports of other violent crimes involving a handgun and a beige or gold Ford Explorer, particularly on the western or northwestern side of the city and county around colleges and Mondawmin Mall, Lioi said. Lioi said that detectives identified a half-dozen additional cases with similar method of operation—three of the cases involving a beige or gold Ford SUV, and five of the cases involving a black semiautomatic handgun. We went and located several victims, and we were able to get those victims to identify the suspects through photo arrays, Lioi said. The investigation linked Campbell and Waller to five additional criminal incidents for which they have been charged, according to police: According to police, Campbell and Waller took the victims indentification cards and threatened to find them if they reported the crimes. Officials said that there may be additional victims who are afraid to come forward. There may be other victims who did not report these crimes to either Baltimore City or Baltimore County, he said. According to police, Campbell and Waller have been charged with numerous felonies, including first-degree rape, first-degree sexual assault, kidnapping and armed robbery. The suspects are being held without bail at Baltimore County Detention Center, and face the possibility of life in prison if convicted, according to police.",1

608,"A Thousand Oaks woman and an Oceanside man pleaded not guilty Thursday in the kidnapping and murder of a 3-week-old Long Beach girl and the attempted murders of the babys parents and uncle. Giseleangelique Rene DMilian, 48, and Anthony Ray McCall, 29, are charged in the Jan. 3 abduction and killing of Eliza De La Cruz, who was found dead in a trash bin in Imperial Beach in San Diego County the following day. The two are also charged, along with Todd Damon Boudreaux, 43, of Fontana, in the attempted murder of a 23-year-old woman and the attempted kidnapping on Feb. 6 of her 4-month-old son in an El Segundo hotel room. Long Beach police Chief Robert Luna alleged last month that DMilian and McCall came up with a plan to kidnap Eliza and pass her off as her (DMilians) own child. DMilian lied to her boyfriend last year, telling him she was pregnant with twins, according to the police chief. She later told him she had given birth to their twins in December while out of the country, but detectives determined that she had not given birth to any children in 2014, according to Luna. Authorities allege DMillian masterminded the kidnapping plot to secure two babies to continue the deception. Elizas mother was walking home with her infant daughter from a bus stop at Del Amo and Long Beach boulevards when a woman -- believed to be DMilian - - pulled up next to them in a black Range Rover and asked about her baby, Luna said. The police chief said the woman had a brief exchange with the mother, then drove away. He said detectives later determined that DMilian and McCall had both been following the bus Eliza and her mother were on, in separate vehicles. About 90 minutes after they got off the bus, McCall allegedly showed up at the De La Cruz home in the 100 block of West 51st Street, shot the three adults -- who all survived -- and abducted the baby. The reason baby Eliza was killed remains unknown, Luna said. Authorities have not disclosed how the baby was killed. About a month later, there was another attempt to steal a baby from a woman who was severely beaten in a hotel room in the 2000 block of East Mariposa Avenue in El Segundo, according to police. Her 4-month-old son was found inside the room and was not injured. McCall allegedly fled the scene after employees knocked on the hotel room door after being alerted by patrons about a female yelling for help, police said. Long Beach police said detectives determined that DMilian had known the woman for several years and was aware that she had recently given birth. The woman was targeted because of the childs age and DMilians knowledge about where to find her, police allege. Detectives believe DMilian misrepresented that she had a charitable organization aimed at helping young mothers and infants, and contacted friends and acquaintances in an effort to find infants. The three defendants were arrested March 25. DMilian and McCall are charged with one felony count each of murder, kidnapping and attempted kidnapping and four counts of attempted murder. The criminal complaint alleges that McCall personally and intentionally discharged a handgun during the Jan. 3 attack and personally used a bat during the attack in El Segundo, and that McCall personally inflicted great bodily injury on the four attempted murder victims. Boudreaux is charged with one felony count each of attempted murder and attempted kidnapping. OTHER PATCH HEADLINES City News Service Photo: Newborn Eliza De La Cruz Get Patched in!

614,"Police in the 112 Precinct and beyond are still on the hunt for a mother who abducted her eight children from a Forest Hills foster care center on Monday. Shanel Nadal, 28, took all eight of her children from the Forestdale campus during a supervised visit. She has not been seen since. Thursday afternoon, the Administration for Childrens Services released a statement, update New Yorkers on the progress of the search. The Administration for Childrens Services is working diligently with the NYPD and law enforcement to locate the children and ensure their safety, said spokesman Michael Fagan. We have initiated an investigation to determine how this incident could have occurred during a supervised visit.  During supervised visits, an agency staff member should be present at all times while still affording the family personal time together. In addition to the statement, Fagan clarified the situation surrounding the abduction, saying that at any foster care agency — like Forestdale — there are often many family visits with both foster and birth parents, happening at any one time, and that the agency where the meeting is taking place is responsible for the safety and security of foster care children. On Wednesday night, police also released updated color photos of the eight Payne children, in the hopes that someone in a position to identify the children would be better able to make a determination. If anyone has any information on the whereabouts of the Payne children or Shanel Nadal, please call Crime Stoppers at at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).  The public can also submit tips at the Crime Stoppers website at WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM or by texting tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then entering TIP577.  All calls are confidential.",1
615,"A 43-year-old Riverview man who was arrested Friday night after threatening to kidnap pop singer Lana Del Rey made his first court appearance Sunday. Michael Shawn Hunt said he would represent himself, refusing an attorney. He faces charges of attempted kidnapping with a weapon and aggravated stalking with a credible threat. Hunt is being held with no bond. Orlando police received a tip from a caller who said Hunt had posted threatening messages on social media toward the singer, according to the police report. Hunt never made it into the Amway Center, where the singer was performing Friday night. He was taken into custody about 9 p.m. about a block from the arena and was carrying a 3-inch folding knife. He also had tickets to the concert, police said, but at no time did he make contact with the singer. Police said there was a concern for the singers safety because of statements posted by Hunt on social media. A Facebook page belonging to Hunt shared several posts professing his love for the singer. I want to see my queen on Friday and from that day forward our decisions will be as one, Hunt wrote on Jan. 30. In his court appearance, Hunt laughed at the prosecutor as she read Facebook posts in the courtroom. The prosecutor read this post: Our queen forever in both worlds, I love you so much, Lana. I cant wait to be back in your arms in a few days, baby. I hear you singing. I miss you, baby. I miss you so much, baby. Hunt told the judge he went to the concert because he wanted to show Del Rey pictures he drew of her. There is nothing in it that sounds derogatory or mean, Hunt said in court. Nothing that said I would harm anyone, he said. Do I care for her? Yes. Do I know her? No. I only know her through her songs. Del Rey issued a statement on Twitter, saying that her other performances will continue. Im doing fine thanks for the messages, she shared on Twitter. And tomorrow well be in Hotlanta cant wait to see everyone. Hunt has served prison terms on charges including burglary, grand theft of a motor vehicle, forgery and possession and sale of marijuana, according to Florida Department of Corrections records.

620,"Santa Clara County officials launched a campaign Tuesday calling on the public to be on the lookout for human trafficking victims. Human trafficking is a real scourge on our community, on our state and on our country. And its the kind of crime that tends to hide in plain sight, District Attorney Jeff Rosen said during a news conference Tuesday outside sheriffs headquarters. The campaign will feature ads on Santa Clara Valley Transportation Agency buses, bus shelters and light-rail vehicles with images provided through the National Human Trafficking Resource Center. The campaign will also feature a photo by Andrew AJ Wassell, a student at Valley Christian High School in San Jose, of a friend blindfolded by the American flag, Rosen said. Wassells piece, titled Blinded, won first place out of more than 50 entries submitted in the district attorneys office Justice For All artwork contest against human trafficking, Rosen said. Human trafficking is an issue that needs to be tackled in the U.S. first before it can be dealt with overseas, Wassell said. The campaign comes ahead of Super Bowl 50 at Levis Stadium in Santa Clara on Feb. 7 when large crowds are expected to attend the big game. These large events have a tragic consequence of attracting and increasing human trafficking, VTA general manager Nuria Fernandez said. There are 1,880 county employees trained in identifying and reporting human trafficking incidents, nearly 900 of which are VTA workers, according to the countys Human Trafficking Commission. Im really confident that with the county working together, were going to find more victims in our area, were going to help more people and were going to stop people from abusing others, Supervisor Cindy Chavez said. The training started in January with VTA bus operators and maintenance personnel who are the frontline throughout the county and interact with the public on a daily basis, Fernandez said. In June, a new operator was able to stop a man who was allegedly abducting a 3-year-old boy. The operator was driving a bus from the Milpitas Public Library two weeks after participating in a training session, Fernandez said. There are a variety of signs people should look for in spotting human trafficking victims, who tend to look nervous, controlled and have little interaction with the public, said Esther Peralez-Dieckmann, director of the countys Office of Womens Policy. Victims can be restaurant workers, fruit sellers at a neighborhood street corner or young women who appear uncomfortable with men, Rosen said. On Nov. 17, sheriffs deputies served search warrants at two Saratoga businesses, a restaurant and a salon, and arrested three people on suspicion of human trafficking, Sheriff Laurie Smith said. Investigators rescued three human trafficking victims and three wage theft victims, according to the sheriffs office. The countys human trafficking task force started its investigation into the case based on tips of human trafficking victims being brought from Spain, sheriffs officials said. Many victims are brought to the U.S. from other countries, but a majority of them are domestic, Peralez-Dieckmann said. People can watch an 11-minute video on the red flags of human trafficking from the Office of Womens Policy and the South Bay Coalition to End Human Trafficking at https://youtu.be/KE8tZafMGWw. Anyone who is or sees a human trafficking victim is asked to contact the countys human trafficking task force at (408) 918-4960 or humantrafficking@sheriff.sccgov.org.

622,"By Carly BaldwinStaff Writer FORT LEE, N.J. - A borough woman who falsely claimed she was kidnapped in Manalapan last summer was indicted this week by a Monmouth County grand jury. Marian Petro, 46, called 911 at 6:35 a.m. on Aug. 19. She said she was pulled over in her car and forced into the back seat of another car near the intersection of Route 33 and Sweetmans Lane in Manalapan. She claimed she was held at gunpoint and put into the backseat of a black Mercedes Benz by a black male with dreadlocks. Manalapan police officers responded but were unable to find the woman, the car or any witnesses to the incident. That led to a massive police search in and around Howell Township for the next several days, where police from several towns, as well as county, state and federal law enforcement agencies responded in an effort to find her. Finally, Petro was located Tuesday in a hotel in Willow Grove, Pa., where she was staying with extended family, a spokesman for the Monmouth County Prosecutors Office said at the time. She was unharmed. If convicted of creating a false public alarm, Petro faces a sentence of three to five years in prison. It still remains unclear why she called 911 with the made-up story.",0
623,"Photo courtesy of the FBI By Bay City News Service Christopher Jay Wootton, dubbed the Cotton Ball Bandit, was sentenced Thursday in Marin County Superior Court to more than 60 years in prison for 10 bank robberies and two assaults on law enforcement in the county over a one-year period. Wootton, 61, of Larkspur, was convicted on 16 felony counts that also included an attempted bank robbery, possession of a loaded firearm in a vehicle and recklessly evading police, Deputy Public Defender Michael Coffino said. The bank robberies occurred between Dec. 12, 2012, and Dec. 11, 2013, in San Rafael, San Anselmo, Greenbrae, Corte Madera, Tiburon and Novato. Wootton was arrested on Dec. 13, 2013, after the robbery of the Novato Bank of the West. A Marin County sheriffs deputy followed his silver Saturn from southbound U.S. Highway 101 into San Rafael where Wootton crashed into a light pole near the Northgate Mall. When Wootton got out of the car with a gun in his hand, he was shot by Deputy Donald Carpenter. He was hospitalized for six days. Coffino said Judge James Chou denied his request to dismiss a prior strike against Wootton for a 1978 kidnapping. Three character witnesses spoke on Woottons behalf at the sentencing, Coffino said. A jury convicted Wootton on April 29. He was named the Cotton Ball Bandit because of a knit hat with earflaps and a ball on top that he wore during some of the robberies.",1

625,"The final of five Wheaton College football players accused of brutally hazing a freshman has plead not guilty. James Cooksey, 22, of Jacksonville, Florida, entered his not guilty plea Monday. The other four players, Kyler Kregel, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, Noah Spielman, of Columbus Ohio, Samuel TeBos, from Allendale, Michigan, and Benjamin Pettway, of Lookout Mountain, Georgia, pleaded not guilty in late October. The five football players face charges of aggravated battery, mob action, and kidnapping for allegedly hazing an underclassman in 2016. The freshman was left on a nearby baseball field with two torn shoulders after he had been beaten and forced into a car. The victim also alleged that the players threatened him with sexual assault. Judge Brian Telander later placed a gag order on the case, but has now lifted it at the request of the mens lawyers to allow them to make public comment about the alleged sexual assault threats. The players and their attorneys have yet to make comment. On Monday, Telander also agreed to permit Pettway and Cooksey to possess firearms for the purpose of hunting animals, according to Daily Herald. Telander also previously permitted all five players to leave the state when they were out on bond. Daily Herald reports that accused player Benjamin Pettway is again requesting to leave the state, this time for missionary work. Telander is expected to consider that request on Jan. 11, when all five players appear in court.

626,"In the nearly six months since police unearthed Jini Barnums body from a shallow grave in the woods of Glastonbury, detectives in East Hampton appear to have methodically built a case against her boyfriend, who was arrested Monday on charges that he strangled Barnum to death, buried her remains and concocted a story that she disappeared following an argument one summer night. But the 13-page warrant in the case, released Monday following 38-year-old Anthony Garofalos arraignment in Middlesex Superior Court, details a mystery that police unraveled by pulling together pieces of evidence to tie Garofalo to the crime. One glaring ommission in the warrant, however, is a motive. According to the document, Garofalo called police at 1:06 a.m. on June 29 to report that He told police she had come home the night before after drinking and was driving their Kia while intoxicated. A verbal argument ensued — with no physical contact — ending with Barnum leaving the couples Main Street apartment around 11 p.m. on June. 28. Let Patch save you time.

The lengthy report includes numerous details gleaned from interviews with friends, acquaintances, family members and others which police tied to together to secure their arrest warrant. Garofalo — a registered sex offender who served an eight-year sentence for charges of sexual assault and kidnapping — has been in jail since August for allegedly violating his parole, a charge brought against him shortly after he was interviewed on Barnums disapperance. Barnums body was discovered on Sept. 3 off Windham Road in Glastonbury. An autopsy determined she was strangled. Garofalo faces charges of murder, tampering with evidence and strangulation.

627,"Update, 1:41 p.m.: The standoff in Huntingdon Valley ended early Wednesday afternoon after authorities arrested an armed man, who is believed to have mental illness, barricaded inside his home. Concerns that the man had hostages or even a bomb proved to be unfounded. Huntingdon Pike and other roads that had been shut down during the standoff were set to reopen shortly, officials told employees at nearby businesses at about 1:30 p.m. The local lockdown, which included ManorCare and a dentists office, has been lifted. Police, SWAT teams and first responders had swarmed to the area of Sorrel and Larch roads, just off of the 3000 block of Huntingdon Pike, at around 10 a.m. Its not yet clear why the man barricaded himself in his home or what sparked the standoff. Officers on the scene told ManorCare employees that they were working to determine if the suspect had hostages. Fire police and EMS special service were also called to the scene, according to Montgomery County Active Incidents. Employees at nearby businesses, including ManorCare, were told to stay inside and to stay away from windows. Crews established a base at the United Methodist Church, eyewitnesses said.

628,"A Tredyffrin Township woman who has been arrested for kidnapping a newborn Thursday at the King of Prussia Mall told authorities she recently had a baby who passed away and in an out of body experience, took the strangers child because I just wanted my baby. According to a criminal complaint provided by Upper Merion Police, 32-year-old Cherie Amoore told investigators she had a baby in February that lived just a few hours. When she held 7-week-old Ahsir Simmons, the feelings rushed back. Police have not confirmed the story provided by Amoore is accurate.   Amoore is facing felony kidnapping charges after taking the infant baby boy from the mall mall food court around 5:30 p.m. Thursday, police said. The search for the baby boy prompted an Amber Alert and a statewide search for hours on Thursday. The baby was found unharmed at her home at 10:18 p.m. He was sleeping in a car seat owned by Amoore. When investigators went to Amoores home on Thursday night, she answered the door and said I took the baby and I am sorry, according to the criminal complaint. She told investigators she did not go to the mall with the intent to steal a baby. According to information from the District Attorneys office, the alleged kidnapping happened after Amoore struck up a conversation with the babys mother at the mall and followed them to the food court. When the mother was helping her older son, Amoore walked away with the infant, leaving through a door near the Bonefish Grill restaurant, police said. Contrary to initial information, the babys mother never consented to allowing Amoore to hold her infant, the complaint said. Investigators said Amoore took the baby to her house, changed its clothing from the outfit he was wearing at the mall and put his original clothes in her car, where they were located by police. In an interview with 6ABC Thursday night after being reunited with her baby, the infants mother said I would like to thank God for allowing my baby to come back. And, I want to thank the Upper Merion Police Department, and everybody on social media that helped me get my baby back. I want to thank you so much.

Her bail was set at $500,000 and she is currently lodged in Montgomery County Prison. The charges follow a joint investigation by Upper Merion Police Department, Montgomery County detectives and the FBI. 6ABC confirmed that Amoore is the daughter of Republican Party of Pennsylvania Deputy Chairman Renee Amoore, who is also a panelist on the networks show, Inside Story.",1
629,"Four people have been arrested after a woman said they kidnapped her, tied her up in a San Antonio-area home, held her for three days, injected her with heroin and performed a blood ritual, all in the name of revenge, according to the Bexar County Sheriffs Office. Mercedes Salazar, 32, was arrested Sunday. She is believed to be the ringleader of the group and the last of the four to be arrested, police said. Authorities believe that Salazar targeted the victim, whose name has not been released, because the victim dated her brother who died in August, police said. The 25-year-old victim told police she was zip tied to a chair and injected with heroin, police said. She also described a blood ritual, which involved her hair being cut and blood being drawn. Three days into her captivity, Salazar and James Cerda, an accomplice, left the victim with Teanna San Nicholas so they could run an errand, police said. The victim convinced San Nicholas to cut her loose so she could move around, eat and go to the bathroom, police said. When San Nicholas fell asleep, the victim called her mom, who alerted the authorities. When police entered the house, the victim screamed to alert them to her presence. San Nicholas threatened with scissors and a knife, but police disarmed her and arrested her on the spot. Salazar was charged with aggravated kidnapping and was released from jail Tuesday after posting $75,000 bail.

632,"A man who slashed a Detroit emergency medical technicians face with a box cutter last year was sentenced to 40 to 80 years in prison Thursday in four cases, including three cold cases from 2005 to 2006 that involve the rape and murder of Detroit teenager Dantoya White, whose body was discovered on New Years Day 2006, according to media reports. Michael Montgomery, 31, pleaded guilty in all four cases Thursday in Wayne County Circuit Court in Detroit. His attorney, Wyatt Harris, said Montgomery agreed to the plea deals to spare the victims of his crimes the pain of a trial. He wont be eligible for parole until he is 71, and the maximum sentence means he could be behind bars until he is more than 100. Kelly Adams, whose face was slashed in the attack on two EMT workers on Oct. 20, 2015, and who remains on medical leave, said at the hearing that she will carry the scars and suffer emotional trauma throughout her life. Paramedic Alfredo Rojas was also attacked as they tried to give aid to a woman who was with Montgomery. He was slashed in the hand, and both were near death when they drove themselves to the Detroit Receiving Hospital for treatment, according to earlier reports. He got all Freddy Krueger with us … but he didnt win, Adams said, according to a report in the Detroit Free Press. She described Montgomery as a psychopath that tried to kill two medics that were just trying to do their jobs. Lorenzo White, the uncle of Dantoya White, whose body was discovered in an alley on Jan. 1, 2006, also spoke. You just didnt kill her, he said of his niece. You took her soul. See Also: Adams said a sentence that allows Montgomery to apply for parole in 40 years was too light. Its a slap in the face to all of us, she said, The Detroit News reported. She said she wanted Montgomery to see the extent of her injuries. I just wanted him to look at it, she told reporters. I mean, he filleted it open, figured he might as well look at it. Speaking with reporters after the proceeding, Whites mother, Morennica Jefferson, said Montgomery should never see daylight again, just like my daughter wont see daylight. Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the Wayne County Prosecutors Office, told the Free Press its improbable that Montgomery will be granted parole. What happened to the victims in this case is unspeakable and thats why a plea in this case of 40 to 80 years was an excellent resolution, Miller said. It is for all practical purposes a life sentence. Montgomery pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and first-degree criminal sexual conduct in Whites murder and rape. He also pleaded guilty to first-degree criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping in a 2005 rape of a 33-year-old woman, and to first-degree criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping and torture in a 2006 case. In the attack on the paramedics, Montgomery pleaded guilty to two counts of assault with intent to murder, two counts of assaulting/resisting/obstructing causing serious impairment, and assault with intent to maim.

634,"Five months after the arrest of a man who exposed himself in front of , Jenny Schneidereith is still waiting for the school to formally inform parents about the incident. The mom of quadruplet daughters said she is frustrated with the lack of notification by the school and wants assurances that parents will be told of future incidents. Baltimore County Public Schools system officials said that such notification is always left up to the judgment of individual principals, who are under no obligation to alert parents to criminal incidents outside school property. Schneidereith said she is not happy with the response, especially with the impending release of the man convicted of exposing himself outside Ridgely School. Shame on them for not being more proactive, she said. Schneidereith had just walked her daughters to school on Jan. 6 when she passed a van parked near the school on Lynncrest Road near Welford Court—a high traffic area for students walking to school. The van had its license plate taped over. Inside, a man was exposing himself. I walked by his car and he was doing his thing, Schneidereith said. The man eventually drove away. Another parent followed the van and was able to get a license plate number after the driver pulled over and removed the tape. The driver, Donald Warfield, 48, . Warfield, who lived in the 5200 block of Dewitt Road in Halethorpe, was convicted in March of indecent exposure and sentenced to three years in jail with all but three months suspended. He is expected to be released in late June. Warfield, a former Baltimore County police officer, was fired from the department for a similar incident in Glen Rock, PA. Schneidereith said she had hoped the school system would send a notice home to parents about the incident. Susan Evans, principal at Ridgely Middle School, did not return a call seeking comment. Capt. Martin Lurz, commander at the Cockeysville Precinct, sent an e-mail to area community associations in January explaining Warfields actions. Lurz said he also sent an e-mail with the facts of the situation to Evans to help quiet rumors that a child had been abducted in the incident. Lurz said he does not have access to the schools e-mail distribution lists but hoped that his e-mail would have been circulated. Our goal was to just get the facts out there, Lurz said. With kids being involved, parents are going to want to be concerned, and rightly so, about sending their children to school. Even though [Warfield] turned himself in, not everyone knew that. Schneidereith said the school should inform the community. The school decided not to send info home at all, she said. I felt that was a bad decision. Schneidereith continues to press her case with school system officials, asking that a notice be sent home telling parents that Warfield is about to be released. At this point, Im so mad with the school system, Schneidereith said. How can they not share this information with people? ... Hes going to be out of jail in June. Charles Herndon, a county schools system spokesman, said the incident highlights a gray area for school administrators. Out gut is to always release information, but there is also a question of how much a school system should be the town crier of the community, Herndon said. We understand the need for close communication, frequent communication, with the community, Herndon said. There are some communities that may want that information and some communities where it would cause alarm. Thats why we tell principals they have to make those calls. They know how their communities will react to the news that is shared with them. In this instance, Herndon said that Warfield didnt accost a child and didnt flash a child, and students were already inside the building. Herndon said he understands Schneidereiths concerns and said police were absolutely right about letting the community know about the incident. But should people look to the schools for that information? Herndon said. Thats debatable.",0

636,"A professor emeritus testified Wednesday in a hearing on a motion in Santa Clara County Superior Court that if granted, would move the location of an upcoming trial for a man facing charges associated with the 2012 disappearance of 15-year-old Sierra LaMar. Attorneys representing the defendant, 25-year-old Antolin Garcia-Torres, have filed a change of venue motion as theyre looking to move his trial outside Santa Clara County. Garcia-Torres has been charged with the kidnapping and murder of Sierra, who was last seen leaving her unincorporated Morgan Hill home on March 16, 2012 and never made it to her bus stop. California State University, Chico Professor Emeritus Edward Bronson took the witness stand where he was questioned by defense attorney Brian Matthews before Superior Court Judge Vanessa Zecher at the Hall of Justice in San Jose Wednesday. The professor has taught courses in constitutional law and criminal procedures. He has a doctorate in law from Denver University a doctorate in political science from the University of Colorado. Bronson, 86, has testified in 117 cases in which he favored a change of venue, including the case against Jared Loughner for shooting Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 18 others in Tucson, Arizona in 2011, but the defendant later pleaded guilty. Bronson also made the same recommendation more recently in the trial of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, but the hearing stayed in Suffolk County. In Garcia-Torres case, Bronson said he was in favor of moving the hearing outside the county based on his analysis of the alleged crime, news reports and a survey he conducted among 300 residents. The professor said he understood the prejudicial effect of the media before a trial. He analyzed coverage of the case through news articles, a majority from The Mercury News and some by the San Francisco Chronicle. Many stories portrayed Sierra in a positive light and demonized the defendant, Bronson said. He based his examination on the nature and extent of the publicity and the crime, the statuses of the victim and defendant and the characteristics of the community. The case against Garcia-Torres is widely known through massive, organized searches for Sierras body that brought in high-profile people such as KlaasKids Foundation founder Marc Klaas, whose own daughter was kidnapped in Petaluma and killed in 1993. Sierras body hasnt been found, which adds prejudice against Garcia-Torres, according to Bronson. There were 300 residents who participated in the professors survey that was designed to see if Garcia-Torres would receive a fair trial in Santa Clara County. About 85 percent of people still remember the case after more than four years and was a part of the collective memory of the county, Bronson said. The size of the county doesnt take away from the change of venue motion and no one element will decide whether the trial will stay or be moved elsewhere, according to Bronson. The hearing will continue Thursday afternoon at the Hall of Justice. Previous coverage: --Bay City News/File images via SAnta Clara Co. SO",1
637,"Jury selection is expected to begin Thursday for the trial of a convicted felon accused of murdering his girlfriend and dumping the 41- year-old educators body at an Indio golf course. Michael John Franco, 45, of Indio, faces life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted of killing Jill Grant, a Palm Desert High School math teacher whose body was found at the Golf Club at Terra Lago in the early morning hours of Dec. 23, 2013. In addition to murder, Franco faces one felony count each of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm and carrying a loaded firearm, sentence-enhancing allegations of using a deadly weapon in the commission of a felony and special circumstance allegations of inflicting torture and committing the murder in the commission of a kidnapping. In August 2015, prosecutors decided against pursuing capital punishment, leaving life without parole as the only potential sentence should Franco be convicted. Grants body was found by golf course employees, who told Indio police that a vehicle sped off, leaving tire marks along the course. Recently released court documents allege that Franco told a fellow inmate in 2014 that he and Grant had gotten into an argument, leading him to slit her throat with a box cutter. He then allegedly wrapped her throat with a towel and drove to the golf course to dump her body, but explained that the human body is resilient and then stated she got up and took off running, at which point he ran her over with the car, according to a prosecutors trial brief. Shortly after Grants body was found, a man who strongly resembled the defendant was seen on surveillance footage driving Grants Prius to an am/pm minimart and gas station in Indio, according to the brief. While there, the man used Grants credit card to withdraw $400, spent considerable time inspecting the cars front bumper and removed a large stick/brush from the bumper area, according to the prosecution. Detectives would later find shrubbery and grass in the cars front grill and under the wheel well, according to the brief. Prosecutors allege a longtime friend of Francos told police that he received a recorded message on his phone from Francos phone -- what he thought was an unintentional butt dial call made at 12:26 a.m. Dec. 23 -- in which he heard what sounded like a female begging for her life. In the recording, Grant appears to be telling Franco that they should call police and report that she was attacked by someone else, according to the court document. He allegedly responded that he would take her to the hospital and call 911, at which point Grant responds by saying, Wait until I can think of another idea. What if I drive the car someplace and call myself and say I was attacked? Would that work (inaudible). Grant was later reported missing by her brother, Michael Thompson, after he and others were unable to get hold of her. Grant and Franco were scheduled to host a Christmas party at their home on Dec. 23, which he abruptly canceled, telling a friend that Grant had left angry the previous night following an argument. Investigators said a search conducted the following day at the residence in the 84-400 block of Onda Drive in Indio revealed blood on several items throughout the house and shoe prints consistent with impressions found at the crime scene, according to court records. Franco was arrested on Dec. 24, 2013, in Palm Desert. Police said in court documents that Franco had to be Tased following a short scuffle in which he allegedly reached for a gun. According to a declaration in support of increased bail, Franco made statements that he wanted to go out in a blaze of glory and stated the police should have shot him in the head because he had emptied his bank account and was going to flee to Mexico. According to the criminal complaint, he was convicted of felony robbery in Alameda County in June 1990, but has no felony convictions in Riverside County. Franco is being held in lieu of $5 million bail. – By City News Service / Patch file photo by Guy McCarthy",0
638,"A 15-year-old girl who was repeatedly raped and abused during nearly a month of captivity in various rural Minnesota locations made a dramatic escape, swimming across a lake and flagging down a farmer for help before helping police arrest three men now charged with kidnapping and assaulting her. The teen hadnt been seen since she disappeared from her home in Alexandria, Minnesota, on Aug. 8. The three men — two of them ages 32 and 31 from Carlos, Minnesota, and a 20-year-old from Mankato, Minnesota — were arrested Tuesday after her swim to freedom. The teen played a key role in their arrests, Alexandria Police Chief Rick Wyffels said at a Wednesday news conference. One of the men, a family acquaintance, tricked the teen into getting into the car by saying he had a family situation and took her to his home in Carlos, where he tied her up with zip ties and then he, his roommate and friend over the next several weeks assaulted her with weapons, Wyffels said at the news conference, which was broadcast on Facebook. Patch does not name victims of sexual assault. (For more local news, click here to find your local Minnesota Patch. Also, if you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) At times during the ordeal, the teen was locked in a closet in the mobile home in Carlos, was given mainly fast-food meals and was moved from place to place, including a cornfield, until her captors moved her to a Grant County location, Wyffel said. When she made her dash to safety, she knocked on doors in the area but got no response, then decided to swim across the lake, he said, according to a report in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. The farmer she flagged down recognized her from various bulletins about a $7,000 reward for information about her whereabouts. He was able to name her before she was able to say any words because he knew what this story was all about, the police chief said. The farmer had left his job to get something he had forgotten at his house when he saw the soaking-wet teen walking out of grasslands behind his house. He initially thought a deer was stirring but recognized her as the missing Alexandria teen as she ran toward him, he told WCCO-TV. The television station didnt name the farmer, who asked for anonymity because he feared for his safety. He scooped her up and was driving her to authorities when she saw one of her accused abductors, the 20-year-old, in a vehicle on the highway, Wyffels said. The man was arrested, the chief said, and a statewide bulletin was broadcast for the other two suspects, who were arrested by a state trooper in Glenwood. The investigation is continuing, and police are asking farmers to report any damage to their cornfields from vehicles driving through them and for anglers and others in the Thompson Lake area to report any clothing they may see floating on or near the shoreline, the Valley News reported. During her swim to safety, the teen lost her shoes and pants, police said. The teen has been reunited with her mother. Photo via Shutterstock",1

640,"Sun Tzu, the 6th century Chinese military strategist had this to say about structuring an army: Management of many is the same as management of few… It is a matter of organization. So it goes for the N.J. Latin Kings. On Aug. 26, a state appellate court in Newark released a 26-page decision that upheld an earlier conviction of several alleged members of the N.J. Latin Kings for murder and kidnapping. As part of a plea bargain resulting from that case, alleged gang member David Martinez detailed the inner structure of the Latin Kings New Jersey chapter to the court. According to Martinez, heres how the gang is set up. THE STRUCTURE The N.J. Latin Kings are controlled by the chairman of the state Crown Council, the highest-ranking member in New Jersey. The state Crown Council – the most powerful decision-making body of the N.J. Latin Kings – consists of the chairs of the six regional Crown Councils. Each of these regional Crown Council chairs has four regional officers beneath him, who are each responsible for the oversight of multiple local chapters, such as Newark, Elizabeth and Perth Amboy. Each of the local chapters has a First Crown in charge. There is a Second Crown (who acts as vice president and assists the First Crown), a Third Crown (who acts as an enforcer), a Fourth Crown (who acts as secretary) and a Fifth Crown (who acts as treasurer). The group is structured more like a Fortune 500 company than a collection of thugs and drug dealers, Philly.com wrote, describing the Kings meticulous organization of their gang. The Latin Kings operate as a well-organized business, the New Jersey State Police stated in a release following an operation that resulted in 47 arrests in 2003. [They are a] well-structured, clearly defined criminal organization, with a defined chain of command and written operating procedures that include formal constitutions, by-laws, oaths and manifestos.

642,"Elk Grove police are scaling back their search for after a major push over the weekend that saw more than 100 volunteers knocking on doors in the Hood-Franklin area. After finding clothes belonging to the 15-year-old on a boat ramp along the Sacramento River, police say they are focusing their efforts on the river while remaining open to the possibility that Ahmadyar is alive and has taken shelter somewhere in the area. For the sake of her family, we would like to hold out hope that she went in, then came out, said spokesperson Christopher Trim. But we dont have any information that puts her outside the area of the river. You would think if a 15-year-old was walking up the road wet, somebody would have seen her. Ahmadyar, who police say suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, left her home on Chamberlin Circle Friday afternoon without identification or medication, setting off a large-scale search by the police department, other local agencies, the U.S. Coast Guard and the California Air National Guard. Searchers contacted nearby residents in person and using the Reverse 911 emergency phone alert system, Trim said. Our best hope of finding her would have been Sunday, he said. Trim said officers would continue searching the area around the boat dock near 10900 River Road Monday, and the department hoped to borrow a helicopter from another agency to patrol the river. If Ahmadyar did go into the river, he said, she could have traveled anywhere from 100 yards to half a mile, and natural factors outside the departments control could complicate the search. From the familys standpoint its going to be a very troubling period of not knowing, he said. Trim added that investigators had not received any indication of an abduction or other foul play, and that while police were scaling back the search, they were not giving up. As long as shes missing, its still going to be an active case, he said. We wont close it until weve found her. Shabnam Ahmadyar is Middle Eastern, about 55 and 125 pounds with black hair and brown eyes, according to police. Anyone with information about her whereabouts can call (916) 691-5246.",0

The child reportedly exited the plane and ran straight to her family in what is being called an emotional reunion. Meanwhile, the man accused of taking Rebecca from her familys home in Lakeland remains jailed in Tennessee. Polk authorities say extradition for West Wild Hogs, 31, has not yet been finalized. The search for Rebecca began on Saturday, Oct. 8 after her 16-year-old sister woke up and found her missing from her bed. Rebeccas family searched around their home in the Lazy Dazy Retreat RV/Mobile Home Park off U.S. 98 for about an hour before calling the sheriffs office. Authorities say Hogs, who had his name legally changed from Matthew Clark Pybus, is a longtime friend of Rebeccas family. He is from Seale, Alabama. Hogs showed up unannounced in Polk County on Oct. 7 and arrived at the familys home on Oct. 8, an email from the sheriffs office said. Hogs and Rebecca were spotted in several locations during the multi-day manhunt. The first sighting was at a Lakeland McDonalds shortly after the alleged abduction. By Saturday evening, the two were seen at a gas station off Interstate 75 in Forsythe, Georgia.

644,"- The Jefferson Co. Sheriffs Dept. identified a suspect who allegedly undertook a multi-hour crime spree that featured a carjacking, police chase, two robberies and gobbling down fistfuls of narcotics. Edward Roy Barron, 31, is being held in Jefferson Co. Jail on $1 million bond charged with first degree kidnapping, aggravated robbery, first degree burglary and menacing. Additional charges are pending, a statement from the sheriffs office said. Barron allegedly started the morning at 4 a.m. by holding a Lakewood driver at gunpoint and demanding his red Nissan near Morrison Road and South Kipling Parkway. The carjacking victim reportedly convinced the suspect to drop him at work -- and keep the car, Jefferson County Sheriffs Office spokesman Marc Techmeyer told Channel 7. Look, man, I just want to go to work. Drop me at work and you can keep my car, Techmeyer said, quoting the victim, who was dropped off at a gas station and called 911, Techmeyer said. Around 9 a.m., the suspect allegedly robbed at gunpoint a CVS pharmacy at 9936 W. Bowles Ave. in Littleton, demanding narcotics. Around 11 a.m. Barron allegedly robbed the Littleton branch Bank of the West at 8184 S. Kipling Parkway. He fled in the Nissan to a nearby neighborhood where he abandoned the car.  At 11:30, Barron allegedly committed a home invasion on the 8000 block of Trinchera Peak, which is in the area where he abandoned the car, Techmeyers email said. He attempted to steal a car from the residence, but was unsuccessful and left the house on foot. He was contacted by deputies about a block away. As deputies approached him, Barron began gobbling down the narcotics stolen at the pharmacy. He was transported to the hospital because he had ingested the pills. In all of the incidents, no shots were fired by Barron and no one was injured, Techmeyer said. Multiple agencies helped locate and take Barron into custody, including Lakewood Police Department, Colorado State Patrol, West Metro Fire and Rangers from Colorado Parks and Wildlife, Techmeyer said.

In late August, police shot and killed and Mark Eric Henderson, of St. Paul, during a hostage standoff at the Red Roof Inn. He was unarmed at the time, but apparently ran from the room a short time after a weapon was pointed at officers.

Howard Gregory, 50, was convicted in May of four counts of second degree sexual assault, first degree kidnapping, fourth degree aggravated assault, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, unlawful possession of a weapon and third degree terroristic threats. The sexual assault charges against Gregory, who legally changed his name to Seven Moon, related to multiple incidents of sexual abuse against a woman who was a teenager when the assaults began. He must complete 85 percent of his term before becoming eligible for parole. The mother of the victims, Janet A. Robinson, 59, of Lindenwold, pleaded guilty to second degree witness tampering and was sentenced in May of 2013 to 364 days in jail and five years of probation. Robinson also was ordered to have no contact with the victims. The women, who were related to Gregory, were kept with little exposure to the outside world and were routinely violated. On one occasion the older victim was restrained and assaulted, and Gregory threatened to kill her son. Law enforcement became aware of the assaults when the abuse became so frequent and severe the victims left the apartment and reported years of assaults to the police. Both victims were present for the sentencing and read victim impact statements in court. I have endured, by the hands of Mr. Gregory, things that no animal should have to experience, let alone any man, woman, or child, the older victim said. Judge McBride, its very hard to find the words to convey the hell my family and I lived in on a daily basis, not knowing when I would take my last breath.  I have lived in turmoil for years and have pain and scars that have yet to completely heal, the younger victim said.

654,"The Washington State Patrol arrested a Lakewood man Friday after he was discovered to be following a woman from Bonney Lake who had a restraining order against him. The woman first noticed the man following her in a black BMW when she entered Interstate 5 near Joint Base Lewis-McChord. When she changed lanes, the BMW would also. She continued onto State Route 512 all the way down to State Route 410 and the BMW followed. She called 9-11 on State Route 512 near the Puyallup Fair Grounds. The 26-year-old female told dispatchers that she was afraid to pull over. She stayed on the phone with the WSP Communications, giving her location and direction of travel while troopers moved into place. A trooper positioned himself on the right shoulder of State Route 410 near the Sumner-Buckley Highway and observed the black BMW with the male driving. As soon as the trooper pulled in behind the black BMW, the driver made an erratic left turn into a grocery store parking lot and, at that point, the trooper initiated a traffic stop. The driver of the BMW was identified as 28-year-old Aaron M. Johnson of Lakewood. Upon contact, Johnson told the trooper he was going to meet a friend at a restaurant. When the trooper asked the name of the friend he was meeting, the driver stated, I dont know, I got to call her. Troopers arrested Johnson on this separate charge and booked him into the Pierce County Jail for violating the protection order. The black 2003 BMW Johnson was driving was seized as evidence and a search warrant was obtained. Troopers searched the vehicle and located a womans wig, some oversized sunglasses, a pair of black gloves, and a roll of duct tape. Upon further investigation, it was revealed the 26 year-old female had a Protection Order against Johnson stemming from a domestic violence incident that occurred last month in Lacey, when Johnson was arrested on numerous felony charges including burglary first degree while armed with a deadly weapon, kidnapping first degree while armed with a deadly weapon, rape first degree while armed with a deadly weapon and felony harassment.

657,"A cousin of the sex offender charged in the murders of two Montgomery County sisters 40 years ago may have had a role in their disappearance or saw their bodies being disposed of, investigators charge. In a recently unsealed search warrant, investigators contend that Connie Akers of Salem, VA, was a participant or witness in the disappearance and disposal the bodies of sisters Sheila Lyon, 12, and Katherine Lyon, 10, of Wheaton. The girls were last seen walking home from a mall in March 1975. Akers has not been charged, and has not commented on the police allegations. On July 10, indictments were handed down by a Bedford County, VA, grand jury that charged Akers cousin, Lloyd Lee Michael Welch Jr., 58, with first-degree felony murder in both sisters deaths. Welch is a convicted sex offender incarcerated in a Delaware prison. Investigators searched Akers home looking for writings, cell phones, computers and hard drives that would show any communications Akers had with Welch, reports WUSA. Akers reportedly told police that after the girls disappeared, Welch came to her house with a duffle bag full of bloody clothing. She insists she would not wash the bag; Welch told her the blood was from spoiled ground beef. SEE ALSO: Bags Burned Smelled Like Death Says Lyon Sisters Witness    Smell of Death According to affidavits unsealed in the case, another cousin, Henry Parker, told detectives he helped Lloyd Welch burn two 60- to 70-pound duffle bags stained red and smelling of decay, reports The Washington Post citing a search warrant. The bags smelled like death, Parker said in court documents. Parker told the Post in a phone interview that he didnt know what was in the bags that were burned. He told the newspaper he didnt see the Lyon sisters. Residents of Taylor Mountain, VA, told investigators that the fire burned for days and smelled like a cremation. Other family members warned Parker to stay away from Lloyd Welch, saying: Hes trouble. Hes trouble all the way around. In May, investigators served a search warrant at the home of his uncle, Richard Allen Welch Sr., in the 4700 block of Baltimore Avenue in Hyattsville. He was previously named a person of interest in the case of the two girls and has denied any wrongdoing. Pursuing All Leads Prosecutors said that the charge filed against Lloyd Welch includes the allegation that during his abduction of the sisters with the intent to defile them, he killed the girls. John McCarthy, the states attorney from Montgomery County, has pledged to continue to pursue anyone who harmed the girls, and those who have lied and misled investigators. Authorities said the investigation continues in Maryland and Virginia, and other charges are possible. While investigators have not found the girls bodies, that search continues. Life was never the same for any parent who tried to raise a child after the disappearance of these little girls. Weve never forgotten the Lyon family or the Lyon girls, McCarthy said. Capt. Darren Franke, head of the Major Crimes Unit of the Montgomery County Police, said last week that Parker, Richard Welch, his daughter, Patricia Welch, and others will be investigated further. I believe theres someone out there that knows a lot more than theyve shared so far, Franke said. I believe theyre waiting for the right reason to come forward. Authorities noted that many residents testified in grand jury proceedings in Bedford County, which resulted in Welchs indictment. But their work isnt done. We will be relentless in finding the facts of this case, Franke said. Look at your conscience, remember back then, remember now as this conspiracy goes on. Call us, were listening. If people have a lead, they can call (434) 534-9521 or email cybertip@ncmec.org. In February, investigators said they believed the girls were taken by the convicted sex offender and later sexually assaulted by his uncle, according to court documents. The information was contained in search warrants executed as Montgomery County Police, the FBI and sheriffs deputies searched for traces of the sisters on Taylors Mountain in Bedford County, VA. The area is the one-time home for both Welch men, authorities said, and two searches of the region have been done. Timeline of Girls Disappearance The girls walked to Wheaton Plaza (now Westfield Wheaton Mall) on March 25, 1975, but never returned home, Patch previously reported. The Washington Post cited documents that say Lloyd Welch told detectives he took the girls when he left the mall the day they disappeared, and that he later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the sisters. Police named Lloyd Welch a person of interest in connection with the kidnapping of the Lyon sisters in February 2014. Welch, who was charged with sex offenses against girls in several states, has been in a Delaware prison since 1997, according to police. Montgomery County Police said that Welch was noticed paying attention to the sisters the afternoon they disappeared. His uncle was named a second person of interest in the abductions in October 2014. The elder Welch was a security guard in the Wheaton area during the time of the sisters disappearance, Patch previously reported. Investigators believe Richard Welch owned property at Taylors Mountain in the Thaxton area of Bedford County, WJLA TV reports. Montgomery County Assistant Police Chief Russ Hamill Hamill said previously he thinks theres a good chance the girls are on the mountain. In an earlier letter to the Post, Lloyd Welch denied any involvement in the disappearance of the sisters. Richard Welchs daughter told the newspaper the allegations are a lie.

660,"A 29-year-old Elgin man has been convicted of murder and kidnapping for forcing his way into his girlfriends home where his infant child was staying in November 2016 and shooting the homeowner, Norbert Gutierrez, 59, of Elgin, to death. He then used his handgun to force the girlfriend and infant to leave with him. A Kane County jury on Thursday night found Alberto Sepeda guilty of first-degree murder, two counts of aggravated kidnapping, and home invasion, all class X felonies, according to a news release from the Kane County States Attorneys Office. Now, Sepeda, of the 300 block of South Belmont Avenue in Elgin, faces a sentence of 45 years to life in prison for the November 2016 murder, prosecutors said. Sepeda, who was intoxicated, drove to a home in the 800 block of Morgan Street where his girlfriend and her infant were staying. At about 4:15 a.m., he pushed his way into the home, and when he refused to leave, Gutierrez, the homeowner, physically threw Sepeda out of the house, according to a news release. As Sepeda fell down the homes front steps, he grabbed Gutierrezs shirt, pulling him to the ground with him. After a brief struggle, Sepeda shot Gutierrez in the chest with a 40-caliber semi-automatic handgun, and then pressed the barrel of the gun against the top of Gutierrezs head and fired another round, killing him. Meanwhile, the other family members in the house bolted the front door. Sepeda forced his way back into the home and ordered his girlfriend out of the house at gunpoint. He forced them into his car and then led Elgin police on a 2.5-mile chase that at one point reached 90 mph before his car broke down in the 1100 block of Oakley Avenue, according to a news release. Elgin police then took Sepeda into custody where he has remained on a $5 million bail. I hope this verdict brings a sense of justice to Norbert Gurierrezs family. He was senselessly murdered because he was trying to protect someone from Mr. Sepedas violent behavior, Kane County States Attorney Joe McMahon said. This murder has roots in domestic violence, a common factor in far too many violent crimes.

You feel like, even though its not your children, a weight has been lifted, said Gosch, whose son Johnny was kidnapped 30 years ago from a West Des Moines street corner as he prepared to deliver the Des Moines Sunday Register. Some other parent had some good news for a change, she said. I didnt know the families, but we all belong to the same club we were all forced into because of what happened to our children. Johnny Goschs kidnapping has never been officially solved, though his mother says her investigation revealed that he was kidnapped into the ugly world of human trafficking. On the 30th anniversary of Johnnys disappearance in September, Patch revisited the case in Iowas Missing Kids: Innocence Abducted. Read these and other stories on Patch:  Innocence Abducted: Noreen Gosch Blinded by Ugly World of Child Sex Trade (Part 2 of a Series) Johnny Goschs Mom a Pioneer in Protecting Children (Part 3 of a Series)  What I Learned About Us from Noreen Gosch: Editors Notebook Want more? Go to Patchs Iowas Missing Kids topics page. It wasnt until Gosch returned home and began learning more about the release of the women – Amanda Berry, 27; Georgina Gina DeJesus, 23; and Michelle Knight, 32 – that the same questions that have nagged her for 30 years began piercing her heart again. Why couldnt we have had some startling news like this for Johnny, or for Eugene Martin and Marc Allen? Gosh questioned. I knew why. Gosch believes there was a cover-up regarding the disappearance of her son and the other two boys. Eugene Martin, another Des Moines Register paperboy, disappeared under eerily similar circumstances as Goschs son almost two years later. On Easter Eve 1986, Marc James Warren Allen never came home after visiting a friend. Gosch: Recent Cases Offer Validation Gosch has been openly critical of police handling of her sons disappearance, saying authorities never properly pursued leads and treated his disappearance as a runaway – a response that still unleashes a sharp tongue that underlies her her acrimonious relationship with law enforcement over the past three decades. I didnt know finding my son would be a do-it-yourself project, she told Patch last year. Gosch said that each time a kidnapping victim is freed after being held in captivity – as was Jaycee Dugard, held for 18 months, and Elizabeth Smart, held for nine months  – theres a message for law enforcement. They need to be a lot more thorough, she said. They need to listen with an open mind. For other families with missing children, the womens escape may provide hope in what many parents are told is a hopeless situation after years pass without a break in the case, Gosch said. Elizabeth Smart was freed because someone recognized her, Gosch said. Jaycee Dugard gained her freedom after 18 years. They are not all dead. They are very much alive somewhere, many times being held by some depraved maniac. Veil Lifted Again on Human Trafficking Gosch believes that Johnny is alive and visited her in her West Des Moines home March 1987, but said that it would be unsafe for him to return home because it would place Gosch and her other children at risk because his captors were still alive and active in a ring of pedophiles who kidnap children for sexual gratification. Cases like her sons and others lift the veil on the ugly world of child sex trafficking, Gosch said. This is amazing, she said. How many more kids have been taken off the streets in the U.S.A. in the same condition that we didnt know about? They are probably in every state, and it all goes back to pedophile activity. People dont want to hear it because it is so ugly, she said. We know there are human traffickers, but we dont always know who they are or what they wear. Are they the people who stand next to you in the grocery store? People shut down and they dont want to know. LINK UP WITH WEST DES MOINES PATCH: Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

662,"An ex-con accused of conspiring with three others to abduct and rob a Menifee woman pleaded not guilty Wednesday to felony charges. Jacqueline Michelle Smith, 33, of Fallbrook was arrested in August and is charged with kidnapping, burglary and a sentence-enhancing allegation of committing a crime while on probation. Smith was arraigned by Superior Court Judge Mark Mandio, who scheduled an Oct. 24 felony settlement conference at the Southwest Justice Center in Murrieta and kept her bail at $1 million. In early August, Smith, 32-year-old Jesse Martin Aaron, 31-year-old Nathan Ernest Lopez and 31-year-old Jedediah Donald Shaw -- all of Fallbrook -- allegedly plotted to abduct the victim and force her to repay a debt apparently owed to Aaron, according to sheriffs Sgt. Sam Morovich. The amount was no disclosed. Aaron and Lopez went to the womans residence in the 27000 block of Holland Road on the afternoon of Aug. 8 and allegedly compelled her at gunpoint to come with them in Aarons vehicle, Morovich said. He did not disclose where the pair allegedly took the woman, whose name was withheld. The following day, Aaron was driving through Murrieta, apparently transporting the victim to another location, when a Murrieta patrol officer stopped him for a traffic offense in the area of Antelope and Keller roads, Morovich said. During the stop, the victim pleaded for help and was rescued, he said. Sheriffs investigators interviewed the victim and Aaron, leading them to confirm the identities of the other alleged co-conspirators, two of whom were taken into custody that week when Riverside and San Diego County sheriffs deputies served a search warrant at Shaws house in the 1200 block of Juliette Place, the sergeant said. Only Lopez could not be located. He remains at large. According to court records, Smith has prior convictions in Riverside County for grand theft, possession of drugs for sale and shoplifting. – By City News Service / Image: Riverside County Sheriffs Department.",0

667,"A woman whose 911 call claiming she was being abducted led to a massive law enforcement response in Howell Township has been charged with creating a false public alarm, acting Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher J. Gramiccioni announced Thursday afternoon. Marian Petro, 46, of Fort Lee, was found Tuesday in a hotel in Willow Grove, Pa., where she was staying with extended family, said Charles Webster, spokesman for the Monmouth County Prosecutors Office. The incident began with a 911 call received by Monroe Township police about 6:35 a.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 19, Webster said. In the call, the woman -- now identified as Petro -- said she was pulled over in a vehicle and forced into the back seat of another car at gunpoint near the intersection of Route 33 and Sweetmans Lane in Manalapan, Webster said. Manalapan police officers responded but were unable to find the woman, the car or any witnesses to the incident, he said. The investigation led to a possible location in the area of Hulses Corner Road and Fort Plains Road in Howell, Webster said, where police from several towns, as well as county, state and federal law enforcement agencies responded in an effort to find the victim. That investigation did not yield the reported victim, vehicle or any additional evidence of an abduction, Webster said. After the area was cleared, the efforts to locate the caller and substantiate the report intensified, Webster said. On Tuesday, she was found, unharmed, at a hotel in Willow, Grove, Pa., where she was staying with her extended family. Further investigation revealed she had purposely made several false statements in her 911 call when she claimed she was held at gunpoint and put into the backseat of a black Mercedes Benz by a black male with dreadlocks, Webster said. Petro is charged with third-degree creating a false public alarm. She is being held in the Montgomery Township Correctional Facility, Lower Providence, Pa., pending extradition to New Jersey, he said. If convicted of creating a false public alarm, Petro faces a sentence of three to five years in prison. The case is assigned to Monmouth County Assistant Prosecutor Christopher Decker, director of the Offices Major Crimes Bureau, Webster said.

669,"Uber and a former driver for the ride-hailing company are being sued by a passenger who alleges the driver took her unconscious to a North Hollywood motel in 2017 and raped her. The plaintiff is identified only as Jane Doe in the Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit filed against Uber Technologies Inc. and Alaric Spence, alleging sexual battery, false imprisonment, battery, civil rights violations and intentional infliction of emotional. Plaintiff joins ... hundreds of other female victims who had been sexually assaulted by Uber drivers -- possibly thousands -- around the world, the suit alleges. The suit was filed Friday and seeks unspecified damages and various reforms within Uber, including the implementation of a policy requiring cameras inside Uber vehicles and the placement of apanic button on an Uber app alerting the company and police of any unlawful conduct by its drivers. Uber spokesman Andrew Hasbun released a statement regarding the complaint that reads, in part: What the rider reported to police is horrifying and has no place anywhere in our society. Our hearts are with the victim. Spence, 47, has pleaded not guilty in Los Angeles Superior Court to one felony count each of kidnapping to commit rape, rape of an unconscious person and rape by use of drugs, according to the District Attorneys Office. He is awaiting a preliminary hearing and his next court hearing is June 8. Prosecutors allege that Spence picked up the woman in downtown Los Angeles June 23, drove her to the motel and carried her from his car into the room, where he raped her. The woman was intoxicated and unconscious at the time of the alleged attack, according to Deputy District Attorney Reinhold Mueller. Los Angeles police said the woman passed out in the back of Spences car while en route to Hollywood about 3 a.m. She woke up alone, not knowing where she was or how she got there, and called police. According to the lawsuit, Doe attended a work function in downtown Los Angeles the previous day and summoned an Uber driver to take her to her boyfriends West Hollywood home because she had consumed several alcoholic drinks. The plaintiff alleges that Spence drove her toward her destination and administered a date-rape drug or something similar to render her unconscious. Once they reached the womans destination, the driver then continued to the Ritz Motel in North Hollywood, where he carried the still- unconscious woman into a room and raped her, according to the lawsuit. Spence left the woman and she awoke later dazed and confused in a strange room wearing only a shirt, the suit states. Plaintiff realized that she had been sexually assaulted when she found two used condoms in the motel room, the complaint alleges. Doe found out that Spence was her alleged assailant by checking the room registration, the suit says. Spence was arrested shortly after the attack. He has prior drug- related convictions and had been an Uber driver for six months, according to police. --City News Service/Shutterstock image",1

Steven Kitchell, 33, was arraigned Thursday afternoon before District Judge Nancy Matos-Gonzalez on charges including kidnapping, rape and sexual assault. He was committed to Northampton County Prison in lieu of $2.5 million bail. Kitchell was arrested in Newark, N.J., on June 26, but it took until Thursday for him to be extradited.

683,"The Washington State Patrol arrested a Lakewood man Friday after he was discovered to be following a woman from Bonney Lake who had a restraining order against him. The woman first noticed the man following her in a black BMW when she entered Interstate 5 near Joint Base Lewis-McChord. When she changed lanes, the BMW would also. She continued onto State Route 512 all the way down to State Route 410 and the BMW followed. She called 9-11 on State Route 512 near the Puyallup Fair Grounds. The 26-year-old female told dispatchers that she was afraid to pull over. She stayed on the phone with the WSP Communications, giving her location and direction of travel while troopers moved into place. A trooper positioned himself on the right shoulder of State Route 410 near the Sumner-Buckley Highway and observed the black BMW with the male driving. As soon as the trooper pulled in behind the black BMW, the driver made an erratic left turn into a grocery store parking lot and, at that point, the trooper initiated a traffic stop. The driver of the BMW was identified as 28-year-old Aaron M. Johnson of Lakewood. Upon contact, Johnson told the trooper he was going to meet a friend at a restaurant. When the trooper asked the name of the friend he was meeting, the driver stated, I dont know, I got to call her. Troopers arrested Johnson on this separate charge and booked him into the Pierce County Jail for violating the protection order. The black 2003 BMW Johnson was driving was seized as evidence and a search warrant was obtained. Troopers searched the vehicle and located a womans wig, some oversized sunglasses, a pair of black gloves, and a roll of duct tape. Upon further investigation, it was revealed the 26 year-old female had a Protection Order against Johnson stemming from a domestic violence incident that occurred last month in Lacey, when Johnson was arrested on numerous felony charges including burglary first degree while armed with a deadly weapon, kidnapping first degree while armed with a deadly weapon, rape first degree while armed with a deadly weapon and felony harassment. Johnson was able to post bail and was released from the Thurston County Jail on May 29. This is an ongoing investigation and only Johnson knows what his plans were, but one thing is for sure this young lady is safe and sound with him behind bars. -- Editors Note: The above information was supplied by the Washington State Patrol.",1
684,"Written by LANNING TALIAFERRO (Patch Staff) A $100,000 reward is offered for information leading to the arrest of escaped Clinton Correctional Facility inmates Richard Matt and David Sweat. Both men are considered to be a danger to the public and anyone with possible information or with knowledge of unusual activity should immediately contact the State Police at 518-563-3761. As of Sunday afternoon, more than 250 law enforcement and corrections officials were actively searching for them. They are convicted murderers and our first order of business is to ensure they dont inflict any more pain on the community, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said. We are urging anybody who sees them or knows anything that may assist our investigation to contact the State Police as soon as possible. With the publics help, we will return these men to where they belong – behind bars. According to WNBC-TV, law enforcement officials are looking at closely at the probability that the two received inside help - perhaps from civilians or contractors - to facilitate their escape. They couldnt have escaped on their own, Cuomo said during a press conference Monday. Though the search remains mostly in the areas around the prison, Cuomo added that the two could be anywhere, including Canada, another state or even Mexico where Matt knows people. Matt and Sweat were first unaccounted for during a 5:30 a.m. bed check on Saturday, and executed an elaborate escape plan to penetrate the prison walls and security that included cutting through metal pipes and walls using power tools. It was the first time in Clinton Correctional Facility history that anyone has escaped from the maximum security portion of this facility. Nicknamed Dannemora after the village its located in, it was built starting in 1844. It is the largest maximum security prison and the third oldest prison in New York. Sing Sing opened in 1826. It was named after the village its in, but the village leaders changed the communitys name to Ossining just to separate themselves a little. The oldest prison in New York state, Auburn, opened in 1818, in Auburn, NY. Richard Matt, 48 years old, a white male, 6 tall, 210 pounds, with black hair and hazel eyes. He has tattoos on back Mexico Forever, a heart on his chest and left shoulder, and a marine corps insignia on his right shoulder. David Sweat, 34 years old, white male, 511 tall, 165 pounds, brown hair and green eyes. He has tattoos on his left bicep and his right fingers. Sweat is serving a sentence of life without parole following his conviction in Broome County for one count of Murder 1st Degree after he caused the death of a Broome County Sheriffs Deputy on July 4, 2002. Sweat was transferred to Clinton Correctional on October 30, 2003. Matt is serving a sentence of 25 years to life following his conviction in Niagara County for three counts of murder, three counts of kidnapping, and two counts of robbery after he kidnapped a male victim and caused his death by beating him on December 3, 1997. Matt was transferred to Clinton Correctional on July 10, 2008. According to state officials: State Police, in conjunction with Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS), the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), Forest Rangers, U.S. Marshals, and the FBI are conducting grid searches to ensure a thorough search of the ground is completed. More than 150 leads have been developed since the escape was reported. State Police, DOCCS, and federal investigative personnel as well as surrounding agencies are following up on each lead. Several aircraft from state and federal agencies are also being used. The State Police currently have about 100 personnel including uniform, investigative and specialty units on the ground actively searching and following leads. State Police continue to coordinate with several other local, state and federal agencies. At this time, more than 250 corrections and law enforcement officers are involved in the region and additional investigative services are being applied statewide and nationally. All available assets are involved in this effort. Patch Editor Alfred Branch contributed to this report. Photo: Richard Matt, left, and David Sweat. Photo credit: NYS Police",1
685,"The Alexandria Police Departments Special Operations Team spent Friday morning cleaning up Charles W. Hill Park in Del Ray to honor its namesake. Charles W. Hill was killed in a hostage situation in Old Town 24 years ago Friday. The APDs Special Operations Team adopted the small park, which is located at 300 E. Oxford Avenue, that was named after Hill after his death. On March 22, 1989, Hill was partnered with Officer Andrew Chelchowski when Alexandrias Special Operations Team was called to the 300 block of Hopkins Court. Jamie Wise, an escapee from a halfway house in the District, had taken hostages inside a home to collect a debt on a drug deal. Shortly after 6:30 p.m., Wise emerged from the home holding a sawed-off shotgun to the head of a hostage. A police marksman fired and hit Wise in the heart. High on drugs, Wise fired twice before other officers opened fire. Wise died, but his two shots struck Hill in the head and Chelchowski in the legs. Hill was taken to Washington Hospital Center where he was pronounced dead at 8:15 p.m. Chelchowski committed suicide in 1993 after battling the stress from the incident. Hill, 40, had served with the Alexandria Police Department for 13 years and had previously served with the New York City Police Department. He was survived by his wife, Virginia, their sons Charles and Robert, and his mother.

687,"When Facebook started including AMBER Alerts on peoples news feeds this week, the social media company cited the case of a Baltimore County girl who went missing last year as its inspiration. An 11-year-old Dundalk girl and her father, who was suspected of murder, were reported missing from Baltimore County the morning of March 6; the following night, both were taken into custody thanks to innkeeper Carol Gause in South Carolina. Gause shared her account of what happened on Facebook: One evening in early March started out just like so many others. When I had a moment to myself and opened up Facebook, I was surprised by something my friend Linda had posted. It was an AMBER Alert. I had seen them before, but this one was different because I recognized the two faces in the post! Gause verified the man pictured in the alert had booked the room. It was Timothy Virts, charged with first-degree murder, and his daughter. She called the police, and with the assistance of the SWAT team, Virts was taken into custody and his 11-year-old daughter returned to Maryland. Related: Its amazing word-of-mouth efforts like this that inspired us to develop a more systematic way to help find missing children on Facebook, Emily Vacher, safety and trust manager at Facebook, wrote in Tuesdays announcement of the social media sites AMBER Alert program. Heres how it works: If law enforcement issues an AMBER Alert, Facebook users in geographically targeted areas will see a post with the most current information about the case. ...some people may see a few each year and many people will likely get no alerts at all, according to Facebook, which reports law enforcement will determine the geographic target. ...I never want these alerts to become routine, Vacher, who is a former FBI agent, told Dallas Morning News. Rather, she said she wants people to think: Oh my God, Im in a position where I may be able to help. The alerts will appear in the news feed but will not trigger any notifications to a persons phone, according to Facebook. Many people already get AMBER Alerts on their mobile devices because cellular companies began issuing AMBER Alerts to those with wireless emergency alert-automated phones as of January 2013, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. What makes Facebook special, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children told NPR, is the sharing factor, since the Facebook platform allows for spreading the word quickly by pushing share. To get an AMBER Alert issued in the first place, however, it takes more than the push of a button. Law enforcement must ensure the case meets these guidelines, created by the Department of Justice: there has been an abduction; the child is at risk of serious injury/death; there is enough information to help identify the child, captor or captors vehicle; and the child is 16 years old or younger. Approximately 200 AMBER Alerts are issued each year, the Wall Street Journal reports. Facebooks Jan. 13 announcement coincided with anniversary of the day that Amber Hagerman, for whom AMBER alerts were named, was kidnapped from a shopping center in Texas in 1996. She was found days later in a ditch, according to Dallas Morning News. Screenshot from Facebook. Related:",1

689,"An investigation headed up by the Montgomery County District Attorneys office into the police-involved shooting of a suspected robber Sunday has begun. The investigation is standard practice in the wake of any officer-involved shootings. The officers with the Upper Merion Police Department who were involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation, the DAs office said. I can assure the public that this investigation will be fair and it will be thorough, DA Kevin Steele said in a statement Monday afternoon. We will determine the circumstances that led up to the shooting and whether the decision to use deadly force is lawful in that situation. Authorities declined to issue any additional information about the incident, and also would not name the suspect or the officers involved in the shooting. The suspect, meanwhile, remains in serious condition at Paoli Hospital. The incident occurred at 4 p.m. Sunday in a parking lot outside of Lord and Taylors at the Court at King of Prussia. The suspect, described as a serial robber by authorities, had held up a female victim in the Green Parking Garage at gunpoint on Saturday, police said. He allegedly jumped into the womans back seat as she entered her car, holding a gun to her head and demanding her purse. Upper Merion police said they worked with the United States Marshals to identify the suspect, who was wanted for three similar crimes, and a kidnapping, in the Wilmington, Del. area. In at least one of those incidents, he fired a shot at the victim as the victim tried to run away, according to police. Police tracked the suspect back to the Green Parking Garage at 3:45 p.m. Sunday, as they became aware he was driving the same stolen vehicle - which he stole in New Castle, Del. earlier on Saturday - he had used in the Saturday night robbery. When they tried to take the suspect into custody, he fled through the garage, striking police cars and attempting to run down officers who were on foot, according to authorities. Police opened fire and ultimately hit him twice. A 9 mm handgun was found in the front seat of the stolen car. He was immediately given first aid, police said, and then rushed to Paoli Hospital by Lafayette Ambulance. Nearby roads were closed as the scene, near the intersection of Gulph Road and Kirk Avenue, was investigated. Image via Simon Malls",0

693,"Peng Tang has managed to add two more charges to face while still being incarcerated. The crimes, felony third-degree burglary and second-degree theft, were filed Jan. 8 in the Johnson County Courthouse, but they actually are alleged to have taken place in March 2012. According to Iowa City Police Criminal complaints, on March 12, 2012 Tang broke into a home at the 700 BLOCK of Michael St. and stole a MacBook Pro worth $2,000 along with multiple pairs of underwair and bras. A later search of Tangs residence recovered these items. Tang had been a tenant of this house prior to the victims moving in, according to the complaint. On one occasion a tenant came inside to find Tang in the living room holding their mail, but Tang assured him or her that it was alright for him to be there, as he used to be a tenant. Tang was then asked to leave and not return. Later that month, on March 30, at 923 College St. Apt. #8, police officers say they executed a search warrant on Tangs address for the sexual assault charge, and discovered womens underwear, bras, and laptop. When confronted about these, Tang said they belonged to his girlfriend, according to the complaint. Officers, however, noted that the serial numbers had been scratched off, so they sought confirmation from a burglary complaint matching those items. The female victim from Michael St. said that they belonged to her. Tang, now 22, is awaiting trial for the alleged first-degree sexual assault of a female student, a fellow Chinese national. The charge for that incident is first-degree kidnapping, a charge that carries a potential life sentence; he also is awaiting another trial on attempting to convince that victim via a letter into changing her story.

701,"A disbarred lawyer who is also an ex-Marine was indicted by a federal grand jury in Sacramento today on a charge of kidnaping a Vallejo woman in March, according to U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner. Matthew Muller, 38, of Orangevale in Sacramento, will be arraigned on the indictment before a federal magistrate in Sacramento on Monday. He is accused of breaking into a Mare Island home shared by physical therapists Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn on March 23, abducting Huskins and holding her captive for two days before dropping her off near her mothers house in Huntington Beach. The single count of kidnapping is the same charge that was previously lodged in a criminal complaint filed by prosecutors on June 29, but the grand jury action clears the way for a future trial and makes it unnecessary for a magistrate to conduct a preliminary hearing for Muller. The charge carries a possible maximum sentence of life in prison if Muller is convicted. A cell phone Muller allegedly left behind during an attempted home invasion robbery in Dublin on June 5 led authorities to evidence allegedly linking him to the kidnapping. Last month, Muller pleaded no contest and was convicted in Alameda County Superior Court on charges of attempted robbery, burglary and assault with a deadly weapon in the Dublin case. Vallejo police initially said in March that they believed Huskins and Quinns account of the kidnapping was a hoax and that the couple had led police on a wild goose chase. After Muller was charged in the federal criminal complaint, Police Chief Andrew Bidou sent the couple a letter of apology in July. Wagner said in a statement today, The bizarre circumstances of the events in Vallejo in March complicated the investigation of this matter. But the Vallejo Police Department, the FBI, and our law enforcement allies in Alameda County have done excellent work in recent months to bring this investigation to a conclusion, the U.S. attorney said. Muller graduated from Harvard Law School and worked for a time as an immigration attorney. He was disbarred as a California lawyer earlier this year. -Bay City News; Photo courtesy Dublin Police",1

On July 10, indictments were handed down by a Bedford County, VA, grand jury that charged Lloyd Welch 58, with the first-degree felony murder of sisters Sheila Lyon, 12, and Katherine Lyon, 10, of Wheaton. The girls were last seen walking home from a mall in March 1975. There bodies have never been found. In May, investigators served a search warrant at the home of Richard Allen Welch Sr., in the 4700 block of Baltimore Avenue in Hyattsville. He was previously named a person of interest in the case of the two girls and has denied any wrongdoing.  READ ALSO:      According to affidavits just unsealed in the case, a relative of Lloyd Welch told police that in the spring of 1975 he came by unexpectedly with a duffle bag of bloody clothes that he wanted the relative to launder, reports WUSA. A cousin, Henry Parker, also told detectives he helped Lloyd Welch burn two 60- to 70-pound duffle bags stained red and smelling of decay, reports The Washington Post citing a search warrant. The bags smelled like death, Parker said in court documents. Parker told the Post in a phone interview that he didnt know what was in the bags that were burned. He told the newspaper he didnt see the Lyon sisters. In February, investigators said they believed the girls were taken by the convicted sex offender and later sexually assaulted by his uncle, according to court documents. The information was contained in search warrants executed as Montgomery County Police, the FBI and sheriffs deputies searched for traces of the sisters on Taylors Mountain in Bedford County, VA. The area is the one-time home for both Welch men, authorities said, and two searches of the region have been done. Pursuing All Leads Prosecutors said at a Wednesday press conference that the charge filed against Lloyd Welch includes the allegation that during his abduction of the sisters with the intent to defile them, he killed the girls. John McCarthy, the states attorney from Montgomery County, has pledged to continue to pursue anyone who harmed the girls, and those who have lied and misled investigators. Authorities said the investigation continues in Maryland and Virginia, and other charges are possible. Life was never the same for any parent who tried to raise a child after the disappearance of these little girls. Weve never forgotten the Lyon family or the Lyon girls, McCarthy said. Capt. Darren Franke, head of the Major Crimes Unit of the Montgomery County Police, said previously that Parker, Richard Welch, his daughter, Patricia Welch, and others will be investigated further. I believe theres someone out there that knows a lot more than theyve shared so far, Franke said. I believe theyre waiting for the right reason to come forward. If people have a lead, they can call (434) 534-9521 or email cybertip@ncmec.org. Timeline of Girls Disappearance The girls walked to Wheaton Plaza (now Westfield Wheaton Mall) on March 25, 1975, but never returned home, Patch previously reported. The Washington Post cited documents that say Lloyd Welch told detectives he took the girls when he left the mall the day they disappeared, and that he later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the sisters. Our department and our partners in Virginia remain committed to determining what happened to Katherine and Sheila Lyon, saidMontgomery Police Chief J. Thomas Manger in February 2015. We believe that there are people, including family members of Dick and Lloyd Welch, who have information that would further this investigation. Police named Lloyd Welch a person of interest in connection with the kidnapping of the Lyon sisters in February 2014. Welch, who was charged with sex offenses against girls in several states, has been in a Delaware prison since 1997, according to police. Montgomery County Police said that Welch was noticed paying attention to the sisters the afternoon they disappeared. His uncle was named a second person of interest in the abductions in October 2014. The elder Welch was a security guard in the Wheaton area during the time of the sisters disappearance, Patch previously reported. In an earlier letter to the Post, Lloyd Welch denied any involvement in the disappearance of the sisters. Richard Welchs daughter told the newspaper the allegations are a lie. Anyone with information about the case is asked to call Montgomery County Police at 240-773-5070.  »Photo of Lyon sisters from Montgomery County Police Earlier Patch Coverage:",1

704,"A man has been charged with taking thousands of Oxycodone pills during the armed robbery of a Teaneck pharmacy, police announced. A man dressed in all black clothing with his face covered entered J&J Pharmacy, brandished a knife or a pair of scissors, demanded all of the Oxy pills just after noon on June 16, said Hackensack Police Officer in Charge Patrick Coffey. Pharmacy personnel handed over possibly more than 4,000 Oxycodone pills in a plastic bag and the man left the store in a white SUV-style vehicle, Coffey said.

Police found $7,000 cash hidden and a pair of gloves believed to be worn in the robbery while executing a search warrant on the vehicle and Aquinos home, Coffey said. Police could not find the pills and believe Aquino sold them for money, he said. Aquino was charged with armed robbery, kidnapping and related weapons offenses, Coffey said. Aquino was taken to the Bergen County Jail. The Teaneck Police Department assisted with the investigation.

707,"A Santa Ana man molested four girls aged 8 to 12 that he met through his Jehovahs Witness congregation, a prosecutor alleged Thursday, but the defendants attorney told jurors that her client was a victim of false accusations. Jose Luis Aguilera, 42, is charged with nine counts of lewd or lascivious acts with a minor younger than 14 and one count of kidnapping for child molesting, all felonies. Some of the allegations date back to January 2012, continuing through July 2015 when he was initially confronted by police. Aguilera was first confronted about allegedly molesting the girls after he took one of the victims to his apartment in Santa Ana on July 22, 2015, Senior Deputy District Attorney Heather Brown said. The defendant told the girls mother that he planned to take her daughter and his 6-year-old daughter to a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant, Brown said. When he arrived to pick up the alleged victim, his daughter was not with him, Brown said. Aguilera told the girl he needed to stop by his apartment to change his shirt and then he would pick up his daughter at school so they could all go to the restaurant, Brown said. When they got there, Aguilera changed his shirt and then pulled down the pants of the girl, who was so distraught that she ran out of the room crying and washed her face in the bathroom, Brown said. Aguilera took the girl with him to pick up his daughter and sign her out of school, and then they went to another restaurant, Brown said. The alleged victim was so upset that she didnt eat, so the defendant got his money back and took the girls to Chuck E. Cheese, where the alleged victim threw up, Brown said. Aguilera told his daughter that the girl had an upset stomach because she ate a bag of peanuts, the prosecutor said. When the girl got home, she was inconsolable and wouldnt talk to her older sister, but told her parents what happened when they got home, Brown said. The girls parents called police the next day and they set up a covert call between the defendant and the alleged victim, Brown said. The prosecutor told jurors to listen carefully to the defendants responses in the call as Aguileras wife comes and goes from the room during the conversation. Other parents started talking after hearing the rumors about the congregations elders and a police investigation, Brown said. One of the moms remembered a year earlier babysitting the defendants daughter, who said she saw her father kissing another girl, Brown said. A discussion about that alleged incident led the parents to two other girls who claimed to have been molested, Brown said. Under questioning from police, Aguilera initially denied touching any of the girls, but later gave confusing and inconsistent replies that included claims that he couldnt remember whether he molested the girls or not. Aguileras attorney, Sara Ross of the Orange County Public Defenders Office, said, This is a case of false stories, false memories and false accusations. Ross noted that two of the alleged victims are cousins and three of the four were in the same congregation. Two of the girls go to the same school, she said. The defense attorney said the congregation conducted its own investigation of the allegations and kicked her client out. All of the talking among the congregants prompted the girls to make false allegations, and social workers also asked the girls questions in a way that put details into their stories that werent there before, Ross alleged. Ross said she plans to have experts testify on the Jehovahs Witness religion and the psychiatry of false memories and suggestive questioning. One girl changed her story four times over multiple interviews, she said. One girl initially denied she was molested, Ross said, adding the girl told police, Hes nice to me. He gave me a teddy bear. Brown alleged the defendant plied the girls with money and gifts and took them to eat at Burger King to keep them from saying anything about the molestation. Santa Ana Police Department Photo",0
708,"- A man is in Jefferson Co. Jail held on $1million dollar bail after he allegedly undertook a multi-hour Metro Denver crime spree that featured a carjacking, police chase, two robberies and gobbling down fistfuls of narcotics. The Jefferson Co. Sheriffs Dept. identified Edward Roy Barron, 31, who has been charged with first degree kidnapping, aggravated robbery, first degree burglary and menacing. Additional charges are pending, a statement from the sheriffs office said. The sheriffs spokesman, Marc Techmeyer provided a timeline for Barrons alleged one-man crime wave Tuesday. Barron allegedly started the morning at 4 a.m. by holding a Lakewood driver at gunpoint and demanding his red Nissan near Morrison Road and South Kipling Parkway. The carjacking victim reportedly convinced the suspect to drop him at work -- and keep the car, Jefferson County Sheriffs Office spokesman Marc Techmeyer told Channel 7. Look, man, I just want to go to work. Drop me at work and you can keep my car, Techmeyer said, quoting the victim, who was dropped off at a gas station and called 911, Techmeyer said.

Around 11 a.m. Barron allegedly robbed the Littleton branch Bank of the West at 8184 S. Kipling Parkway. He fled in the Nissan to a nearby neighborhood where he abandoned the car. At 11:30, Barron allegedly committed a home invasion on the 8000 block of Trinchera Peak, which is in the area where he abandoned the car, Techmeyers email said. He attempted to steal a car from the residence, but was unsuccessful and left the house on foot. He was contacted by deputies about a block away. As deputies approached him, Barron began gobbling down the narcotics stolen at the pharmacy. He was transported to the hospital because he had ingested the pills. In all of the incidents, no shots were fired by Barron and no one was injured, Techmeyer said.Multiple agencies helped locate and take Barron into custody, including Lakewood Police Department, Colorado State Patrol, West Metro Fire and Rangers from Colorado Parks and Wildlife, Techmeyer said.

712,"- The murder trial for the man accused of holding two men hostage at knifepoint inside a West Hollywood apartment has been postponed. The trial for Alexander Tor McDonald, 30, was postponed until July 25, according to court documents. On April 7, 2014, John Winkler and Liam Mulligan were watching basketball with Mulligans roommate, McDonald, in their West Hollywood apartment when McDonald allegedly pulled a knife and threatened to kill the other two. Mulligan as shot by sheriffs deputies as he rushed out of the apartment clutching his neck, where he had been stabbed. Winkler rushed out after McDonald and a sheriffs deputy opened fire mistakenly assumed that Winkler was using Mulligan as a human shield. The Winkler familys lawsuit alleged that before the shooting, a woman in the apartment complex showed deputies photos of McDonald and Winkler, identifying McDonald as the alleged assailant. One deputy showed the photo of McDonald to other deputies, saying Alex is our guy, according to the suit. The county has since paid $7.5 million to settle claims brought by both the Winkler and Mulligan families. After the mistaken identity shootings, deputies at the West Hollywood Sheriffs Station have gone through several training exercises to prevent the tragedy from happening in the future. The Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department, which provides police services for West Hollywood, has refused to disclose the specific corrective measures taken by the department, citing Californias Peace Officers Bill of Rights. -- Photo via Shutterstock",1

Tewksbury Police responded to a reported robbery about 5:30 p.m. Saturday, at the Holiday Inn on Highwood Drive. They learned that two victims had made arrangements to meet with the defendant. The defendant allegedly robbed the victims at knifepoint before fleeing. Authorities also believe that the defendant is connected to a June 30 incident at a Motel 6 in Tewksbury where a female victim communicated with the alleged defendant through Backpage.com, and was subsequently sexually assaulted and robbed at knifepoint. The defendant allegedly used online services to target victims, D.A. Ryan said in a statement. Anyone who answers online ads should take the same precautions they would for meeting any stranger. The proliferation of websites like Backpage.com has enabled predators to pinpoint potential victims. One of our concerns at this point, is whether others may have suffered similar abuses.

Harringtons remains were found months later.

Graham is a 2013 graduate of West Potomac High School in Fairfax County, south of Old Town Alexandria. In Charlottesville, a longtime cab driver told CBS-6 that Harrington was last seen getting into a cab after she left a concert in Charlottesville. Authorities have reportedly confiscated the cab, from a nearby farm, Charlottesville media outlets reported. There are no charges against Matthew in the Harrington case.

719,"Two kidnapping victims sued the Vallejo Police Department today for publicly accusing them of faking their kidnapping last year. Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn are accusing the city of Vallejo, including police Detective Matthew Mustard and public information officer Lt. Kenny Park, of first accusing Quinn of murdering Huskins while she was still in the kidnappers custody and later publicly accusing them both of concocting the kidnapping story. Despite the accusations by Vallejo police, the FBI solved the kidnapping based on a similar crime reported in Dublin and former U.S. Marine Matthew Muller was indicted in the case. He pleaded not guilty to the federal charges in October. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Sacramento and seeks unspecified damages for defamation, unreasonable search and seizure, false arrest and false imprisonment. Through an outrageous and wholly unfounded campaign of disparagement, Vallejo police created a destructive nationwide media frenzy and rubbed salt in the victims fresh wounds, attorneys for Huskins and Quinn wrote in the complaint. Denise and Aaron deserve justice for Defendants inexcusable conduct, the suit states. Huskins and Quinn were assaulted inside their Mare Island home as they slept on March 23, 2015, by an assailant who bound them both with zip ties, blindfolded them, drugged them and interrogated them in separate rooms. The kidnapper took Huskins, still bound and blindfolded, in the trunk of his car and raped her twice before releasing her two days later, according to the suit. When Quinn reported the crime to police, they interrogated him for 18 hours and accused him of murdering Huskins. During that time Quinn was given a lie detector test and denied access to an attorney, according to the suit. They took his clothing and dressed him in jail clothes, took samples of his blood, put him in a locked interrogation room, and said he would be branded a cold, calculating monster. Meanwhile, Vallejo police failed to monitor Quinns phone as the kidnapper tried to communicate with him via text message and email. Detectives overlooked evidence of forced entry at the home, including slit screens and holes drilled into the windows, according to the suit. When Quinns family, who had been waiting at the station, finally secured him legal representation, he was released because the department had no evidence to charge him with a crime. Huskins was taken in the trunk of a car to an unknown location, still bound and blindfolded with taped swim goggles. The kidnapper raped her twice and told her he was videotaping it, according to the suit. During that time the kidnapper contacted the news media and sent a recording of Huskins. In response to that, Mustard implied to her mother that she was fabricating the kidnapping. She was released March 25 at 10 a.m. near her parents home in Huntington Beach. She found a neighbor, who called police. Rather than immediately return to Vallejo, Huskins stayed with family, wanting to be somewhere safe after her ordeal and avoid the intense media interest in the case, according to the suit. Mustard called Huskins cousin and accused Huskins of concocting the kidnapping, offering her an immunity deal for telling the truth. He told Huskins family back in Vallejo he would be investigating her for criminal activity, according to the suit. Because of that, Huskins hired a defense attorney before returning to the Bay Area. While she was en route that night, Park issued a news release and called a news conference publicly accusing Quinn and Huskins of orchestrating the kidnapping, calling the investigation a wild goose chase that plundered valuable resources from the community, and demanding that they offer the community an apology. When Vallejo police interviewed Huskins they refused to give her a sexual assault examination. At one point, Mustard inquired if she had been sexually assaulted before and suggested she was trying to re-live the excitement of that experience, according to the suit. Dublin police responded to a home invasion robbery less than three months later on June 5 that was eventually linked to Muller. A masked man broke into a couples home as they slept and tried to bind them, but they attacked him and chased him from the home. During the course of their investigation, Dublin police learned of two other similar incidents in Mountain View and Palo Alto. In both incidents a masked man wearing all black bound, blindfolded and drugged sleeping victims and tried to rob them and rape them, according to the suit. Palo Alto police had even questioned Muller. After Dublin police tracked Muller through a cellphone he left behind at the robbery scene, the FBI connected him to the Vallejo kidnapping through evidence found at Mullers mothers home in South Lake Tahoe. He was arrested June 8. Vallejo police sent an apology letter to the victims in July, according to the suit. Asked for comment today, Park, the police spokesman, said he had only first heard of the lawsuit this afternoon but referred questions to the city managers office, as it is common practice not to comment on any pending litigation. The city attorneys office did not immediately respond to request for comment. To date, VPD has not provided any basis for any of its public statements, nor has it provided any evidence to justify its disastrous conclusions, Quinn and Huskins attorneys wrote. This campaign of character assassination was neither required nor part of any professional police activity. --Bay City News; Image via Vallejo Police Department",1

722,"- Tad Cummins, the former Culleoka Unit School teacher charged with transporting a minor across state lines for sex and obstructing justice, pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday, as his victim and her family looked on. Cummins filed notice last week he intended to change his plea with his attorney saying he came to the decision after personal reflection. Prosecutors said Cummins cultivated a relationship with the student over a period of months and had been intimate with her in a closet at the school prior to him taking her from Columbia and disappearing for more than six weeks. Cummins was arrested in a remote area of northern California April 20, 2017. According to an affidavit filed by Maury County Sheriffs Department Detective Jonathan R. Hardison, on March 13, 2017, Cummins told his wife was going to a job interview at the Williamson County Medical Center.The hospital said no interview had been scheduled. That night, Cummins wife found a note from her husband that said he was going to the Washington, D.C. area or Virginia Beach to clear his head and urged her not to call police. She did not contact law enforcement. That morning, a friend dropped the girl off at a Shoneys in Columbia and Cummins Nissan Rogue was spotted on surveillance footage at a nearby gas station around the same time, according to the detective. After the girls father filed a missing-child report and told investigators he feared his daughter was with Cummins, detectives subpoenaed Cummins financial records and learned that Cummins had taken out a $4,500 loan against his car. According to his wife, that money was missing, along with clothes, toiletries and two handguns. Cummins wife also said that her husband had been prescribed erectile-dysfunction medication Cialis and had obtained a seven-pill refill a few days prior to the disappearance. The detective said that employees of Super 8 Motels and its corporate parent determined that Cummins had checked into two Oklahoma Super 8 locations, using his real name both times and both times renting a room with a single queen-sized bed. Cummins and the girl also spent time on at least two communes. Cummins was apprehended in remote Siskiyou County, Calif. after the caretaker of the property where he and the girl were staying - coincidentally, a Brentwood native - recognized them and contacted the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement. Cummins faces up to 10 years in federal prison. His sentencing has yet to be scheduled. He also faces state kidnapping and sex crimes charges. Photo via TBI",0

747,"Wallingford Police have arrested Marilyn Nadeau, 54, in connection to the robbery of an elderly woman at the Fairfield Inn on Christmas Day in 2012. Nadeau was served with an arrest warrant at Meriden Superior Court on Tuesday. She is currently in custody of the Department of Corrections on unrelated charges, according to Lt. Michael Colavolpe. Nadeau was arrested by West Haven Police in December in connection to a 2013 robbery and carjacking in that city. Wallingford Police have charged Nadeau with conspiracy to commit first-degree robbery and conspiracy to commit sixth-degree larceny. Colavolpe said the charges stem from an incident that took place on December 25, 2012 at 100 Miles Drive, the Fairfield Inn. The victim, an elderly female resident of Massachusetts, was staying at the hotel. While she was exiting her vehicle in the hotel parking lot, Colavolpe said an acquaintance of Nadeau approached her. The suspect brandished a firearm and stole the victims purse which contained credit cards and identification. During the investigation, information was obtained that the credit cards were used in New York, according to Colavolpe. On January 17, 2013, Nadeau and her acquaintance were arrested by the Parsippany, New Jersey Police Department for a robbery/kidnapping of an elderly female. During their investigation, the Parsippany Police Department located credit cards and identification belonging to the Massachusetts resident who was robbed in Wallingford. Wallingford Detectives interviewed Nadeau while she was incarcerated in New Jersey. Colavolpe said Nadeau admitted to driving the suspect who committed the robbery at the Fairfield Inn to New York, where she used the stolen credit cards. Upon being released from New Jersey, Nadeau was extradited to Connecticut where she has several pending cases in addition to the Wallingford arrest. The Wallingford Police Department has an active arrest warrant for Nadeaus acquaintance. He is currently incarcerated in New Jersey and upon release will be extradited to Connecticut to face charges here, Colavolpe said.

750,"A 25-year-old womans valiant attempt to save her own life early Thursday morning failed, but her 911 call ultimately led Orange County deputies to her body and put them on the trail of her suspected killer. Jasmine Samuel placed a 911 call at 12:34 a.m., telling authorities she was in the area of 1852 Central Florida Parkway and had been forced into the trunk of her car, the sheriffs office wrote in a media release. That 911 call kicked off an extensive search for the victim and her Nissan Maxima. The search ended at 2:06 a.m. when Samuels vehicle was located. The mother of twos body was found inside. Deputies have identified David Payne, 62, as the primary suspect in the womans death. Payne is Samuels ex-boyfriend, the sheriffs office said. He remained at-large Friday morning and is being described as armed and dangerous by the sheriffs office. Samuel managed to keep a connection open with an Orange County 911 operator for about 15 minutes, the Orlando Sentinel reported. See Also:  Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said operators could hear sirens in the background, but couldnt immediately locate the vehicle. Once the connection to Samuels cellphone broke, operators couldnt get her back. He (Payne) knew that the police were nearby, the Sentinel quoted Demings as saying. It was just very difficult to locate the precise location of the vehicle. Clearly he was moving at different times, sometimes at a high rate of speed. The vehicle and the womans body were found about 4 miles from the abduction site. Anyone who spots Payne is asked to avoid contact and call 911. He is originally from the Apopka area, but it is unclear where he may have fled. Payne faces first degree murder and kidnapping charges, the sheriffs office said.

753,"- A male suspect was shot and seriously wounded by Charlotte police officers responding to a breaking-and-entering call in west Charlotte Monday night after they found him holding a pregnant woman hostage at gunpoint. The incident unfolded after Metro Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police officers responded to a 911 call in 1900 block of Holly Street around 10 p.m. Sept. 25. When they arrived, they found suspect Jonathan Autry, 28, holding a gun on the woman. A child was also in the home.

754,"Originally posted at 3:33 p.m. Oct. 24, 2014. Edited with new details. By PAUL ANDERSON City News Service An Orange County jury determined today that a twice-convicted child molester, who had himself castrated in his bid for freedom from a state mental hospital, is no longer a sexually violent predator and should be released. Kevin Reilly, 53, plans to enroll in an outpatient program for sex offenders in Utah as soon as he is released from the custody of the Orange County sheriff, which was expected to happen this afternoon, according to his attorney, Deputy Public Defender Holly Galloway. Reilly audibly sighed in relief when the finding was announced, wiped away tears from his eyes and asked a deputy for a tissue as he later sobbed. Some of the jurors also cried. The seven men and five men on the jury reached their finding in what is essentially a civil proceeding after they began deliberating Wednesday. Juror Mike Wilson said the panel was initially evenly split on whether Reilly should stay committed in a mental institution. For Wilson, the case came down to the three experts who testified Reilly was no longer a sexually violent predator, a change from their earlier opinions when they evaluated him. If (the prosecution) had just one doctor saying there was a high probability to re-offend it would be different, Wilson said. At the end of the day the subject matter is disgusting, Wilson said. But I continued to focus on what I had to do... Is there proof he would re- offend? Wilson said he was also convinced Reilly was safe for release because he has participated in courses while in custody, agreed to be castrated and because three doctors who have evaluated him over the years changed their opinion on whether he is fit for freedom. Some jurors did not find Reillys testimony convincing, but Wilson said it didnt matter because of the expert testimony. In his testimony during the civil proceeding in which prosecutors attempted to keep him confined to a state mental hospital, Kevin Reilly struggled to explain his sexual attraction to children. He blamed his behavior on financial woes caused by living above his means. Asked why he molested his first victim, a 4-year-old girl who attended a San Diego daycare business he operated with his then-wife in March 1982, Reilly replied, I dont know if I can answer that question. At that point in time I was literally out of control. Deputy District Attorney Michael Carroll argued that Reilly remains a sexually violent predator and should be confined indefinitely to a state mental institution. Reilly was arrested and spent a day in jail for the molestation of the 4- year-old girl, but her parents declined to press charges. He and his wife later moved to a Tustin condominium to save money, Reilly testified. Reilly lured his next victim into his apartment with the promise of a soda. Its really hard to put into words, Reilly said when asked why he found the young girl sexually attractive. The fact that it was easy, she wasnt going to tell and I only cared about my own gratification. Reilly and the girl engaged in horse play before he tried to convince her to take off her bathing suit, he testified. We started to wrestle and thats when I made the comment, You have a hole in your bathing suit. I can fix it,  Reilly testified. She said, No, I dont. You have a wife. Reilly molested another 4-year-old girl he met by the condo complexs pool. I cant explain the sexual component, Reilly said. Its illogical. As I sit here today and think about it its almost repugnant. It is repugnant. Reilly said he had a job with a collection agency, but was living beyond my means, and was stressed out about it. He said he lied to his neighbors, telling them he was a police officer in hopes of gaining their trust and easier access to their children. About a week after molesting the second girl in Tustin, Reilly was arrested, but he posted bail in December 1982, he testified. The following March, Reilly kidnapped his 2-year-old daughter and took her to Mesa, Ariz., where he again told neighbors he was a police officer. While living in Arizona under a phony name, Reilly molested his own daughter, saying he felt he could easily get away with it. Over Easter weekend in 1983, Reilly molested another 4-year-old girl in Arizona as well as her older 8-year-old brother, he testified. He said he was not typically attracted to boys. I think it could have been anybody at this point, Reilly said. It just shows how out of control I was at the time. Reilly pleaded guilty in August 1983 to molesting the two Tustin girls and kidnapping his daughter and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was sentenced to eight years in prison in Arizona for molesting the 4-year-old girl and her 8-year-old brother. After Reillys release from prison, he was living with a new wife and their 4-year-old daughter, who he also molested, Carroll said. He was convicted in 1999 and sentenced to another three years in prison, but before he could be paroled, Orange County prosecutors filed a sexually violent predator petition against him. In 2003, Reilly underwent a voluntary castration and has been treated for his pedophilia, Carroll said. Although at least two experts who have evaluated Reilly do not think he would sexually assault anymore children, Carroll said, He still has sexual thoughts of pre-pubescent girls. ... He is not honest, he is not transparent and he continues to manipulate. The evidence is going to show he is still a sexually violent predator.

756,"By Justin Heinze and Kara Seymour: A teen allegedly killed by her adoptive mother and mothers boyfriend in Bucks County over the summer endured a lifetime of abuse, according to new reports released this week. Abingtons Grace Packer was abused multiple times in her life before she was killed last July by her adoptive mother and her mothers boyfriend, according to an interview with a lawyer representing Graces birth parents and published in the Associated Press. When she was 3, Graces birth parents reportedly lost custody because other adults were sexually abusing Grace, according to the AP report. When she was 9, her adoptive father, David Packer, was sent to prison for sexually abusing Grace. He has since been classified as a sexually violent predator, the Megans Law Database states. The final and fatal assault took place last July, when authorities say Sara Packer, 41, and her boyfriend Jacob Sullivan, 44, engaged in a torturous rape-murder fantasy in Bucks County. RELATED: Heartbroken Community Plans Services For Teen Allegedly Killed By Mother In Bucks County The pair, who were charged over the weekend, allegedly kidnapped, raped, poisoned, and eventually strangled Grace before dismembering her body and stashing it in the woods, officials said. Hunters found Graces body on Oct. 31 in the woods in Luzerne County. The lawyer for Graces birth parents told the Associated Press that her birth parents were good people who simply did not have resources to care for Grace and her siblings. Authorities said that Sara Packer first came under suspicion when she moved from Abington to Richland without telling police. She also failed to give police a picture of Grace, which they had requested. A preliminary hearing for Sara Packer and Jacob Sullivan is set for Jan 20.

759,"Story by City News Service An urgent, widespread search continued today for a man suspected of killing a longtime friend, kidnapping at least one of her two children and setting fire to his own East County home, where the womans body was found last weekend along with that of an unidentified child. James Lee DiMaggio, 40, allegedly killed 41-year-old Christina Anderson, whose remains were discovered in the charred rubble of his house in the 2000 block of Ross Avenue in Boulevard shortly after 8 p.m. Sunday. Investigators soon determined that she had been slain, sheriffs homicide Lt. Glenn Giannantonio said. Since the fire, the whereabouts of the victims children, Ethan, 8, and 16-year-old Hannah, have been unknown. The urgency to find them led officials to launch the Wireless Emergency Alerts, a system that set off cell phone alarms throughout the region, including Claremont and La Verne. On Tuesday evening, the youngsters father issued pleas through the news media to the fugitive suspect -- formerly a close friend -- and to his absent daughter. Jim, I cant fathom what you were thinking, Brett Anderson said, standing in front of a crowd of reporters and cameras in front of sheriffs headquarters in Kearny Mesa. The damage is done. Im begging you to let my daughter go. Youve taken everything else. He then addressed the missing girl. Hannah, we all love you very much, he said. If you have a chance, you take it. You run. Youll be found. The deceased young child found in the embers of DiMaggios gutted rural home remained unidentified, Giannantonio told news crews following the fathers comments. It is a possibility that its Ethan, he said. Its a possibility that its another child (whom) we havent identified yet or dont realize is missing yet. In addition to killing the Lakeside woman and child, DiMaggio is believed to have torched his house and detached garage, Giannantonio said. The charred body of a dog also was found in the ashes. The apparent homicide victims causes of death were under investigation. A statewide child-abduction alert in the case was issued Monday evening. Authorities believe DiMaggio may be driving a blue 2013 Nissan Versa sedan, California license plate 6WCU986, and possibly fleeing to either Texas or Canada. Realistically, we dont know where theyre going, Giannantonio said. Were keeping a wide net, and hopefully well find them. Were looking everywhere. ...

Weve been following up on every one of those tips, he said. Theres still a backlog that were trying to catch up on. Right now, we dont have any confirmed sightings of them, but there are several tips that were following up on and (that) do look promising. In addition to having been good friends with Brett and Christina Anderson for years, DiMaggio was close to their children, according to Giannantonio.

760,"One of the original four defendants who allegedly tormented a mentally challenged Crystal Lake man and streamed video footage of it online is back behind bars after her phone was used to log on to Facebook. Brittany Covington, 19, had been on probation after pleading guilty to a hate crime stemming from the infamous 2017 incident. But part of her probation included staying off the social media platform. Covington was arrested in January 2017 with Jordan Hill, Tesfaye Cooper and Tanishia Covington, her sister. They are accused of tying up the then-18-year-old victim with duct tape before beating and taunting him at Covingtons West Side apartment. While captive, the victim — who is white and has schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder — had his clothes and hair cut and was forced to drink water from a toilet bowl. The defendants, who are black, can be heard shouting, F--- Donald Trump! and F--- white people! in the video that captured the brutal incident, which was streamed live on Facebook All four defendants pleaded not guilty to various charges, including aggravated kidnapping and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. In December 2017, Brittany Covington made a deal with prosecutors, receiving four years probation in exchange for pleading guilty to a hate crime, aggravated battery and intimidation. The terms of her probation, however, were contingent on her staying off social media during that time. In March, software on Covingtons phone showed the devices Facebook app had been accessed at least three times, and she was taken into custody because of that last week, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. April Preyar, Covingtons lawyer, told a Cook County Judge William Hooks that someone else had borrowed Covingtons phone and used the pre-loaded social media app on it, the report stated. Hook rejected that theory and told Preyar that the individual who borrowed the phone needed to appear at Covingtons hearing in June, the report added.

She had been in jail since her arrest following the January 2017 incident. Last month, Brittany Covingtons sister, Tanishia, 25, made a similar deal with prosecutors, pleading guilty to a hate crime, intimidation and aggravated battery. But Tanishia Covington was given a three-year prison term instead of probation. Cooper and Hill are expected to stand trial later this year. In March, Hill rejected a plea deal that would have sentenced him to eight years in prison if he pleaded guilty to aggravated kidnapping and a hate crime.

762,"Heavily armed and hallucinating about dragons and lizard people, state and Pierce County deputies encountered a man suspected to be heavily under the influence of stimulants along Pacific Avenue Sunday night. The 54-year-old man apparently told police he had snorted methamphetamine and was taking morphine. The incident happened around 8 p.m. Saturday along Pacific Avenue just north of SR 512. Someone saw the mans Jeep Cherokee parked in the middle of the road and called 911 to report it as suspicious. By the time state patrol and Pierce County deputies arrived, the man was out of the vehicle waving around a pistol and the AK-47. Police surrounded him at gunpoint and ordered him to get on the ground, which he did. But when police went to handcuff him, he began struggling and screaming. Police shocked him with a Taser. Once in custody, the man began describing how President Donald Trump had called him at home to warn that lizard people were on the way. Also, something called the alpha dragon had taken his family hostage. Paramedics took the man to a local hospital for evaluation where he will remain for the next two weeks. Inside the Jeep, police found plenty of weaponry: the AK47, a Ruger .357, AK47 ammo, and a wooden bat. The man also had close to 200 rounds in the car. Police took custody of the weapons.

763,"- A man who held SWAT officers at bay for nearly four hours surrendered to police on Friday afternoon. The incident began about 8:30 a.m. when a Bellaire Police officer pulled over the driver of a small SUV at Fournace Road and Loop 610. Bellaire Police Chief Byron Holloway said the SUV driver, whose identity has not yet been released, ran a stop sign at Fournace and was pulled over. Holloway said the driver got out of the SUV and fired two shots at Bellaire Police, hitting the windshield. The officer, who was not injured, fired back at the driver who took off on foot. Holloway said police chased the man to Anderson Street and were closing in on him when he fired one more shot at police before running to a home in the 4800 block of Tamarisk Street.   Holloway said the man sat down and put the gun to his head and officers immediately tried to start a conversation with him. We tried to talk to him and tried to get him to put the gun down, but he refused to cooperate, Holloway said. Bellaire Police called Houston Police SWAT and hostage negotiators to the area and were able to talk the man into surrendering. He was taken into custody and will undergo a mental evaluation, HPD Assistant Chief Larry Satterwhite said. No one got seriously injured today, including our suspect, Satterwhite said. It was a very volatile situation. Police said they still do not know why the man got out of his vehicle and began shooting. (For more news and information like this, subscribe to Patch for free.

766,"It was one of the most horrific murder scenes veteran Peabody police officers had ever seen. On Feb. 17, police found the bodies of Mark Greenlaw, 37, and his girlfriend Jennifer OConnor, 39, wrapped in plastic and rolled into rugs laying in the garbage-filled basement of a now condemned crack house at 19 Farm Ave. Greenlaw was killed instantly by a shotgun blast to the face, while OConnor was raped and her throat was slit. There was blood everywhere. The two suspects – Wes Doughty, 39, and Michael Hebb, 45 – fled the scene, prosecutor Kate MacDougall explained in Salem Superior Court on Monday. But before they left, they tried to burn down the house and burn evidence of the murder using a blow torch and cans of kerosene, according to MacDougall. During his 90-minute confession to the police, Hebb explained the motive for murder. MacDougall said Hebb got Doughty all revved with unsubstantiated allegations that Greenlaw was abuse, drugging or poisoning Doughtys physically disabled uncle, who lived in the house. Hebb told Doughty that Greenlaw was abusing...Doughtys uncle, MacDougall said. Hebb played on Doughtys deep loyalty toward his uncle, MacDougall said. Greenlaw was also viewed as an intruder into to Hebb and Doughtys drug dealing, MacDougall said. In court, Doughty was ordered held without bail after pleading not guilty to charges of: first-degree murder (two counts), rape, attempted arson carjacking kidnapping and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Hebb is currently held without bail on two counts of assessor after murder and attempted arson. But the judge will reconsider Hebbs no-bail status if his family can post $60,000 cash bail and ensure he will remain on 24-hour house arrest in a home approved by the judge Both men are scheduled to return to court on July 11. As Doughty and Hebb were fleeing the scene, police began a murder investigation and a multi- state manhunt. After splitting up, Doughty allegedly carjacked 64-year-old Kenneth Metz at knifepoint in Middleton on Feb. 22, forcing him to drive around for hours, before finally abandoning the man and his car in Boston. Afterward, Metz told the media that Doughty said the murders were due to the couple giving heroin to his godfather. Doughty allegedly confessed to the murders, Metz said. Doughty drove Metzs car 1,000 miles to South Carolina, where he was arrested in Spartanburg County for panhandling. His name was checked and the Massachusetts murder warrants showed up. The Salem News reports that court documents show Doughty had a troubled childhood with drinking and smoking marijuana by junior high school. He tried an outpatient stint at rehab after a 1996 robbery arrest, but drugs remained his demon. Before this incident, Hebb didnt have much of a criminal record. As for the victims, 37-year-old worked Greenlaw worked in construction. His body was covered in tattoos, most notably the phrase White Powerwas inked across his chest, below a Celtic knot, according to court documents. The parents of Jennifer OConnor have told the media that their daughter had a good heart and struggled with drug addiction. The 40-year-old reportedly suffered health problems throughout her life, including leukemia at age 5, a stroke at 15, and a decade ago she was in a coma for a week due to a flesh-eating bacteria, CBS Boston reports. Her problems with drugs and alcohol began after she was prescribed narcotics following medical treatment.

Gwinnett County Police have charged Equeill Williams, 22, of Buford, with rape for an attack Wednesday outside a restaurant on Buford Drive, and say he is believed to be the suspect in three other attacks. Shortly before 9 p.m. Wednesday, police responded to the Golden Buddha restaurant at 4300 Buford Dr. There, a 28-year-old woman told officers she had just ordered take-out from the restaurant and was loading food into her car when she was approached from behind by a man.

768,"- The family of a Spring High School student who vanished after getting off the school bus in 2010 still hold out hope that she will one day walk through the front door. In fact, Jo Ann Lowitzer has never lost hope that her daughter, Ali Lowitzer would return home 7 years after her mysterious disappearance. Ali Lowitzer, who would be 23-years old today, was just 16-years old when she vanished on April 26, 2010. Shed sent a text to her mother, letting her know she was walking to Burger Barn to pick up her paycheck, and hopefully work a couple of hours. Cameras at Spring High School, and cameras on her school buss recorded Ali from the time she left campus at about 2:20 p.m., until she got off the bus 25 minutes later, just a few house from her home. Her last text at 2:57 p.m. was to a friend, asking them to come over later that evening. Acording to her family, Ali was an active texter, so they find it odd that there isnt any activity after her last text. She was active in softball, girl scouts and was a talented artist. By all accounts, she was happy. Witnesses reported seeing her walking toward Burger Barn on 22760 Cypresswood Dr., but she never made it to work, and never picked up her paycheck. Several hours had passed, so when Jo Ann Lowitzer hadnt heard from her daughter, she drove to the Burger Barn, and found the lights off, the chairs stacked on tables and on one in sight. Panic set in, and Jo Ann Lowitzers life changed forever.  Since that day, her efforts have gone from the normal, to a flurry of activities to concentrated effort to find her child. People and police searched for Ali, but she wasnt found, and with the lack of real leads, the case grew cold. The Lowitzer family, however has remained committed to finding Ali, and has worked with law enforcement officials, Texas EquuSearch, private investigators and psychics to try and find her. The whereabouts of Ali Lowitzer are seemingly endless. The private investigator the family hired believes she was kidnapped and is a victim of sex trafficking -- a not so unbelievable theory since Houston is considered a major sex and human tracking hub. Over the years, the family has raised $25,000 that is offered as a reward for information leading to Alis location and return home. (For news updates on this story and other Houston news, just click here to get Patchs daily newsletter and free, real-time news alerts).

771,"- The mother of an Abington girl found dismembered in the woods in Luzerne County has been released on bail, according to court documents. Sara Packer, of Quakertown, has been charged with felony child endangerment after she allegedly misled authorities during the investigation of her daughters disappearance, according to the Bucks County District Attorneys Office. Abingtons Grace Packer, 14, first went missing from her home on July 11. She was found on October 31 in a wooded section of Bear Creek Township, in Luzerne County, police said. She had been dismembered and the only way authorities were able to identify her was through her dental records. Authorities announced the discovery last week. The precise connection of Sara Packer, 41, to her daughters disappearance remains unclear. Authorities said that she is a person of interest in the case, but she does not face charges of murder or kidnapping. According to WFMZ 69, officials believe that Sara Packer may have typed a bogus letter from Grace, describing how she thought she was a burden to her family. Sara Packer adopted Grace along her with ex-husband, David Packer, when Grace was a small child, the report states. David Packer, who lives in Northampton, is a convicted sex offender, according to the Megans Law Database. He has been classified as a sexually violent predator. You may leave here with more questions than answers, Bucks County District Attorney Matthew Weintraub said in a press conference last week . But two things are certain: Grace Packer was murdered, and we will use all of our joint investigative resources to bring Graces killer to justice. Police said that they are looking to speak with anyone who may have seen or spoken with Sara or Grace Packer at any time since June. Authorities from Bucks, Montgomery, and Luzerne counties are working with the FBI on the case. Sara Packer has a preliminary hearing set for January 18.

774,"Two women and three men accused in the gang-related slaying of a 21-year-old Beaumont woman must stand trial on felony charges, a judge ruled Friday. Samuel Jesus Acosta, 33, Francisca Perla Acosta, 35, Erika Cristell Garcia, 26, Ernest Ralph Granados, 27 -- all of Banning -- along with Matthew Zeus Munoz, 25, of Beaumont were arrested in March 2017 during a series of law enforcement raids connected to the death of Jasmine Zuniga. At the end of a preliminary hearing Friday at the Banning Justice Center, Riverside County Superior Court Judge Chad Firetag found there was sufficient evidence to warrant a trial for each defendant. Samuel Acosta is charged with murder and kidnapping; Francisca Acosta is charged with being an accessory after the fact; Garcia is charged with attempted murder and kidnapping; Granados is charged with murder and street gang activity; and Munoz is charged with murder and kidnapping. Firetag scheduled a post-preliminary hearing arraignment for Oct. 19. All except Francisca Acosta are being held without bail or in lieu of bail amounts ranging from $1 million to $2 million at the Smith Correctional Facility in Banning. Acosta is free on a $500,000 bond. They were taken into custody during a sweep conducted by the Beaumont Police Department, with the assistance from the Corona, Hemet and Murrieta police departments, as well as the Riverside and San Bernardino County Sheriffs Departments. According to Beaumont police Detective Robert Galletta, Zuniga was found fatally shot in her vehicle on Michigan Avenue, near Eighth Street, about 10:40 p.m. on March 4, 2017, after patrol officers were called to the area to investigate reports of shots fired. Galletta did not disclose details about the shooting, or a possible motive behind it. The three men have prior convictions.

775,"A New Jersey police officer has helped spark renewed interest in the fatal stabbing of a 7-year-old girl 50 years ago this week - an unsolved case that, he believes, someone is still alive to speak about. Hes done it by using the modern methods of social media, and putting a spotlight back on the stabbing death of Wendy Wolin. Elizabeth Police Capt. Todd Mooney, who reopened the case several years back, has put together a Facebook group that has attracted interest - and can attract some possible tips - regarding Wolins death. Mooney doesnt mince words on the page regarding potential eyewitnesses to the case, saying this: On March 8th, 1966 Wendy Wolin was murdered in front of Pierce Manor and no one has ever been charged/arrested. It has been [50] years but someone knows WHO KILLED WENDY WOLIN. This group is for anyone who chooses to share memories of that day, rumors you may have heard and/or what you heard your family members say about this crime. He also wrote on this on Facebook: March, 8, 1966. Wendy Sue Wolin was murdered in front of her home on Irvington Avenue. Someone out there knows who did it. Some shared their experiences from the time, saying they were either impacted by the case emotionally, or perhaps found themselves victimized by an experience that could have been connected. A few years later, my mom got an anonymous kidnap threat by phone telling her I was tied up in his trunk. He asked her if she wanted to hear me scream. Fortunately, I was at school that day, but my mom was not sure because in those days, we walked to school and he claimed to have snatched me on the way. He also made a reference to Wendy. Wendys sister, Jodi, showed her appreciation in one response: To my dear sweet sister Wendy, I cant believe we have been apart for 50 years!! Never been a day that you were not in my heart! I can believe that sooo many people have been affected by your loss and how you left this earth! So happy we will have a memorial and make sure that you are recognized!! I love you more than words can say and hope you with mommy and daddy One day when I leave this earth I want you to be there to get me please. I miss you sooo much. Be happy and soar with the angels my little beauty. Your loving sister, Jodi. Wolin was stabbed to death while waiting for her mother outside their apartment building in Elizabeth 50 years ago. A composite sketch of the male suspect in one of largest manhunts ever in the state was released, but the case still went cold, according to police and news reports. What people still find puzzling is that the murder was apparently one of several crimes allegedly committed by suspect on the same day. Despite his public behavior, he still couldnt be found. In a composite sketch released at the time (see photos), Elizabeth police said the suspect allegedly stabbed a 11 year old girl in the buttoocks, then put his arms around a 16-year old girl at Morris Avenue and Prince street. A sort time later, he accosted an 18-year-old girl when asking for directions. Immediately after, he stabbed the 7-year-old girl in the stomach with a small hunting knife, police said. The case has picked up momentum recently as the 50th anniversary came this week, and WNBC-TV and The Daily Beast wrote about it. One woman, Beth Moroney, told WNBC-TV that she is certain she saw Wendys killer on her block the same day that her friend, 11-year-old Mae Rubenstein, was stabbed more than a dozen times inside the family home on South 3rd Avenue in February 1965. I saw the face and I knew right away it was the same man, Moroney told the station. All I could do was scream. I just kept screaming, Its him, its him. Photo: NBCNew York.",1

779,"The California Supreme Court refused today to review the case against a woman convicted of fatally shooting a man on an Altadena street during a confrontation over his 4-year-old nephew. Mesha Arshaz Dean was found guilty in March 2012 of second-degree murder for the March 18, 2007, killing of Monroe Monty Miles. Dean was the girlfriend of the boys mother, Vanessa Marie Ochoa, and had accompanied her to a home where the tot was living with his father and his grandparents. During Deans trial in Los Angeles Superior Court, Deputy District Attorney Tamu Usher told jurors that she drove from Nevada to California with Ochoa by her side, a loaded firearm and one intent in mind -- to take (the child) from his father without his permission and without his knowledge. The boys father -- who was out of town -- had left his brother a note authorizing him to take care of his son, and Miles followed Ochoa to try to stop her from putting the child in Deans car. Right after he said the words, Youre not taking my nephew, he was shot and killed by the defendant, the prosecutor told jurors. The boy was found two days later with the two women, who were arrested. Along with murder, Dean was convicted of kidnapping and child endangerment. In a ruling Feb. 4, a three-justice panel from Californias 2nd District Court of Appeal rejected the defenses claims that there were errors in Deans trial and her ensuing sentence of 49 years and four months to life in state prison. Ochoa pleaded guilty in August 2010 to voluntary manslaughter, kidnapping and child abuse, and was sentenced in April 2012 to 15 years in state prison. —City News Service",1

781,"On the 45th anniversary of the abduction and murder of 11-year-old Linda OKeefe, the Newport Beach police department did their best to breathe life into her story, rekindling the search for her killer this week. Police recreated the nightmare of a family that learns their child went missing in a personal way: from the 11-year-old girls point of view over Twitter. Linda was last seen alive on Friday, July 6, 1973 when she was abducted near her school, Newport Beach Police Department officer Jennifer Manzella said. Her body was discovered the next morning in the Back Bay area. She had been strangled. The suspects DNA was left behind at the scene, but, thus far, her killer has never been found. Manzella has thoroughly reviewed her files, boxed up with notes, interviews and reports taken 45 years ago to build Lindas story in a first-person point of view narrative along with pictures of Linda and evidence from the crime scene. My mom made my dress, and also the book bag Im carrying. Its red, white, and blue, with stars – and it feels very patriotic after the 4th of July, Linda says. My mom made matching bags for all three of us (my sisters and me). The sweet description of the dress and the satchel made of red white and blue fabric, were eerily at odds with the empty evidence photos on grainy police film. Knowing the grim end to the tale makes reading the girls tweeted comments about her day and life even more gut wrenching, but, like an unputdownable crime novel, the reader cannot look away. Readers were riveted to the story as the facts were dribbled out over the course of many hours, starting when Lindas day did at 7:45 a.m. Linda caught a ride to school instead of biking as usual. She was an 11-year-old girl starting to spread her wings, looking forward to going to the beach on her own and making runs to the candy store between classes. All that changed after school when she fails to get a ride home with her mother. She lamented the fact she had to walk home. But Linda never made it. I sit on the curb in front of the school, with my feet sticking out in the street. Ill leave soon, Linda says. Then, a van pulls up near the corner of Marguerite and Inlat, and Linda is seen talking with whomever is inside. A friend of Lindas, Janine, witnessed the conversation Linda had with the driver of a turquoise-colored van, Manzella writes on Twitter. The friend will remember and re-account the details to police later along with many who wish they could have done more to catch Lindas killer. The anniversary is here, and that is always the time to get an emotional look into a cold case, Manzella said. Hopefully by Saturday morning, with timed Tweets to coincide with when Lindas body was found, the community will be inclined to look back and remember. We will release a sketch on Saturday in hopes of making a connection, Manzella told Patch. The sketch will be based on a Parabon DNA compiled image of a man who left his DNA behind at the scene. That technique of using DNA to determine a suspects facial composite, gender, ancestry, freckles and skin, eye and hair color has been used successfully in the past to identify suspects in the past. Manzella hopes that thousands of eyes will train on the image, and that they will at last be able to name Lindas killer. Thats a game changer for us, Manzella added. We hope someone will recognize him. Manzella wanted to use storytelling for this cold case after she saw a similar story told from a cold case in Canada. Those Tweets stuck with me, she told Patch. I wanted the same emotional attachment for Linda. There has been an outpouring of support from people who knew Linda, those who lived in town at the time, or people touched by her story, Manzella said. Lindas sister, a new Twitter user, has declared that NBPDs Tweets are Linda to a T. Manzella hopes that renewed interest in the case will finally lead to justice for Linda. It is so easy to lose a connection to the person over time in a Cold Case, she said. By giving Linda a voice, we personalize her story that otherwise might be just another press release that passes you by. Read Lindas Story On Twitter: twitter.com/NewportBeacPD #LindasStory",1
782,"By TERRI VERMEULEN KEITH A girl testified today that she was taken in the dark from her Northridge home nearly 2 1/2 years ago by a man who repeatedly sexually assaulted her at various locations. The girl -- who was 10 at the time and is now 13 -- told the Los Angeles Superior Court jury hearing the case against Tobias Dustin Summers that she woke up in her bed on March 27, 2013, after hearing a voice telling her to get up and feeling herself being shaken. Summers, now 34, is charged with 16 counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child, 14 counts of oral copulation/sexual penetration with a child 10 or younger, two counts of sex/sodomy with a child 10 or younger and one count each of kidnapping, kidnapping to commit another crime, first-degree burglary, forcible lewd acts upon a child, using a minor for sex acts and possession of matter depicting a minor engaging in sexual conduct. The girl told jurors that the voice sounded like a mans and that she thought she could see a knife in his hand. She said that her assailant grabbed her wrist, led her out of her room and out of a sliding glass door. (The) defendant still has his hand on your wrist, correct? Deputy District Attorney Laura Knight asked the girl. Yes, she responded. Was it still dark out? the prosecutor asked. Yes, the girl said. The girl said she was led to an alley, where she was told to get into a car driven by another man who asked why she was along. The driver eventually got out of the vehicle after her assailant said he was going to drop her off at a fire station, she said. She said Summers switched to the drivers seat, drove away, directed her to move to the front of the car and sit underneath the glove compartment, then sexually assaulted her and spanked her at one point, telling jurors that he ignored her plea to stop. Were you crying? Knight asked the girl. I dont remember, she said. Were you scared? the prosecutor asked. Yes, the girl responded. She said she wanted to go home at the time. Did you want to be with him? Knight asked. No, the girl said. The girl said she was driven to an area where there appeared to be moving trucks and led into one of the trucks, where she was ordered to take off her clothes. She said she was bound around the mouth with a belt because I was making noise. I was trying to get him to stop, she said. She testified that she was repeatedly sexually assaulted inside the dark truck and that pictures were taken of her naked with a cigarette in her mouth. The girl -- who is set to continue her testimony Friday morning -- was allegedly taken to other locations and sexually assaulted before being left near a hospital, the prosecutor told jurors in her opening statement. Jurors will hear that Summers allegedly thought that snipers were coming to look for him after the two started hearing helicopters while inside a vacant home and told the girl to get in a bathtub and wash the DNA off, the prosecutor said. He allegedly told the girl that he would kill her and her family and publish photos he had taken of her if she told anyone what had happened before he dropped her off near a hospital, Knight told jurors. Subsequent testing didnt find any sperm, but DNA testing determined that DNA found on the girls face and shorts was consistent with Summers DNA profile, the prosecutor said. DNA testing also showed that hair found on one of the seats in Summers car proved to be the girls, and a forensic search of a laptop computer found in the room Summers rented showed searches for airline flights and 10- year-old Northridge girl found a day after the girls kidnapping, Knight said. Defense attorney Jeff Yanuck told the seven-man, five-woman jury that there was no physical evidence of DNA showing a sexual assault. He said jurors would hear that the girls account of what occurred had changed. Her story is inconsistent with the facts, Summers attorney said. He urged jurors not to be persuaded by emotions. ... The evidence will not show that there was a sexual assault, Yanuck told jurors. The girls mother, who was called as the prosecutions first witness, testified that she woke up, heard noises in her daughters room and saw their dog trying to get at the girls pet hamster, then realized that her daughter was not in bed. She said that she started screaming the girls name and called 911 after not being able to find her daughter. Jurors heard a recording of the womans emotional 911 call reporting her daughters disappearance. The woman said she saw her daughter later that afternoon at a hospital with scratches and bruises, and said her daughter has subsequently needed counseling. She said she was relieved that her daughter was alive, and that the girl told her a few days later about details of the alleged sexual assaults. Summers was arrested almost a month later at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center south of Tijuana, Mexico. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said a $25,000 reward that was highly publicized south of the border led to the telephone tip about Summers whereabouts. Summers has remained jailed since then. Daniel Martinez, 31, who was charged along with Summers, was convicted last October of burglary but acquitted of the girls kidnapping. He was sentenced last November to six years behind bars. The prosecutor told jurors during Martinezs trial that Martinez drove away from the scene of the burglary before leaving Summers alone with the girl. City News Service",1
783,"Sign up for the Sandy Springs Patch newsletter! ---- Sandy Springs police investigators are looking for two women who allegedly kidnapped a victim and robbing her at gunpoint. Officers were dispatched just after 1 p.m. April 8 to an apartment complex in the 6900 block of Roswell Road and met with a woman, who recounted the incident to police. According to an incident report released by the police department, the victim said she was walking out of her apartment unit when a four-door silver or gray Honda sedan pulled up to her. The woman behind the wheel of the car told the victim she needed help because her mother, who was seated in the back seat, was about to faint, the report states. An older woman in the back seat of the car opened the door and asked for help, but the victim refused. Thats when things began to get dangerous, the report notes. The older woman suddenly told the pedestrian to get into a vehicle. When she refused, the victim said the woman allegedly pulled out a black semi-automatic pistol, pointed the firearm at her and once again repeated her demands, according to the report. The victim complied and once she got into the car, the vehicle left the apartment complex and turned south on Roswell Road. During the trip, the woman told police she was robbed of $200 in cash, an Android smartphone, a pair of gold earrings, gold necklace, gold elephant charm, gold bracelets and gold rings. Those items were believed to be collectively worth around $6,950, the report notes. After they stripped the victim of her valuables, the suspects forced the woman out of the car. The driver is described as a light-skinned Hispanic female who appeared to be around 35 years old. She was sporting a short hairstyle, and was wearing a white jacket and blue hat with a red and blue flower emblem. The older woman was also described as a Hispanic woman with darker skin and possibly around 50 years old. She had medium length hair and was wearing black pants and a gray jacket. The victim said she believed the women sounded like they were from Central or South America, according to the report.

784,"There was no attempted abduction in Barrington last week. That does not mean children should ever accept offers of a ride with a stranger. A Barrington police investigation into the complaint lodged on Oct. 4 by the mother of a boy who said a strange man asked him and two other boys if they wanted a ride home turned out to be an attempt at doing a good deed. The boys, all pupils at Hampden Meadows School, had just been dropped off at a school bus stop at Mathewson Road and County Road. Barrington Police Chief John LaCross said the use of the term abduction was probably too strong a word for the incident because the man did not attempt to force or lure the boys into his car. Typically, the police chief said, someone who attempts an abduction will use candy or ask a child for help in finding a lost puppy. But the kid did the right thing, LaCross said. He reported it as he should have. As it turned out, the police chief said, the so-called stranger in the vehicle was known to at least one of the other boys. He was simply offering them a ride home on a rainy day, the chief said. We found the person in the vehicle, LaCross said. He was just a neighbor who knew the boys from his neighborhood. No one knew that, however, when the suspicious condition was reported to police, and the mother asked for a watch on that same day to see if anyone returned.",0
785,"The man dubbed the East Coast Rapist – already facing life sentences for rapes in two Virginia counties -- pleaded guilty Monday to three first-degree rape charges in Prince Georges County. Aaron Thomas, 43, of Connecticut is a suspect in rapes from Rhode Island to Virginia over a 20-year span, authorities say. He was indicted in March 2013 on a total of 54 charges in Prince Georges County, including first-degree sex offense, theft, kidnapping and false imprisonment. He is accused of raping and kidnapping six women in the county between February 1997 and August 2001, NBC Washington reports. Authorities believe he is connected to 17 rapes; 12 of which Thomas has been tied to based on DNA evidence.  Thomas was sentenced in March 2013 to three life terms in prison for raping two Prince William County, VA, teenagers and abducting another, as they were trick-or-treating on Halloween night 2009.  Defense attorney for Thomas argued in the Virginia cases that he suffered from a number of mental disorders and had been abused as a child, so that should pose a mitigating factor. An expert witness for the defense, who evaluated Thomas, testified that though Thomas clearly had a range of issues, he was legally competent. The three Virginia girls were attacked as they were walking home from trick-or-treating. They were cutting across a shopping center parking lot when Thomas pulled out a lighter that looked like a gun and asked if they had money, according to court documents.  When the girls said they did not, Thomas ordered them to a wooded area behind the store, and told them to drop their bags full of candy. He then took them to a clearing down a hill, where he told them to lie face down on the ground. He sexually assaulted the two 17-year-old victims, but the 16-year-old was able to text her mother from the scene. »Patch file photo of Aaron Thomas",1

787,"- Officers arrested a woman Monday in Santa Rosa for brandishing a firearm and making threats, then learned Wednesday that she was prohibited from possessing firearms, according to Santa Rosa police. On Monday at around 1 p.m., police officers were dispatched to the 2400 block of Grace Drive on a report of a woman pointing a firearm at workers cutting down a tree. The woman was later identified as 62-year-old April Hamilton of Santa Rosa. According to police, Hamiltons neighbor on Grahn Drive obtained a permit to remove a diseased tree that bordered the backyard fence line separating the two properties, but Hamilton did not want the tree removed. While a tree removal company was on site and workers were in the tree, Hamilton allegedly stood in her backyard, pointed a firearm at them and threatened to shoot, police said. The workers climbed down from the tree and retreated to a safe location, and Hamilton returned to her home. Patrol officers, a K-9 officer and a hostage negotiations team responded to the scene, surrounded Hamiltons home, and called into her residence, but did not get a response. Hamilton was then located in her backyard and taken into custody without incident. An unloaded Winchester rifle was recovered from the scene, police said. Hamilton was booked into the Sonoma County Main Adult Detention Facility on suspicion of making terrorist threats and brandishing a firearm. On Wednesday, Santa Rosa police learned that a civil court order prohibited Hamilton from possessing any firearms, and that a handgun was registered in her name. A search warrant was then written and served at her home on Grace Drive. During the search officers found an unsecured, unloaded revolver. By Bay City News/Images via Santa Rosa police",0

Aramazd Andressian Sr. had been jailed in lieu of $10 million since Saturday, when he was found unconscious in a park in South Pasadena, sparking a search for his missing son, Aramazd Andressian Jr. The man was released from custody Tuesday, with sheriffs officials saying investigators saying they have made the decision not to present the case to the Los Angeles County District Attorneys office for filing consideration at this time.

The victim tried to escape but was captured by Barham, who then took the child to a nearby warehouse in Irvington. It was there that he sexually assaulted the boy and threatened his life. The boy was only 4 feet, 11 inches and 100 pounds at the time of the attack, Assistant Prosecutor Amber Loughran, the lawyer who tried the case, stated. The child escaped naked and ran for help. Prior to this crime, Barham had been arrested 18 times. He was convicted of criminal sexual contact and endangering the welfare of children in 2002 and was sentenced to five years in state prison. He was also charged with sexual assault twice in Essex and Monmouth counties, but was found not guilty both times. This defendant is a predator who poses a grave threat to society. We will be seeking the maximum penalty when he is sentenced, Assistant Prosecutor Amber Loughran said. While he was not convicted of the kidnapping charge, we are satisfied with the jurys verdict. The 2011 assault occurred just four months after the 49-year-old sex offender had been released from prison, where he had served 13 months for violating provisions of Megans Law. Barham was wearing a court-ordered GPS Ankle Monitor when he attacked the 13-year-old victim in Newark.  According the Essex County Prosecutors office, the jury deliberated for more than three days following a two-week trial before the Honorable Robert H. Gardner, Judge of the Superior Court. Following the verdict, Judge Gardner immediately revoked bail. Sentencing has been scheduled for Jan. 9.",1

The grandfather was treated for his injuries in the alleged attack and did not need to visit a hospital, according to Kent. While inside the home the boy allegedly killed a kitten, the spokesman said. The deputies set up a perimeter and established communication with the boy from outside the residence, according to Kent. Firefighters and an ambulance were staged nearby and hostage negotiators were called to the scene, he said. About 45 minutes later, the boy emerged from the home carrying a shotgun and a rifle, which he pointed at one of the deputies, according to Kent. The deputies then shot at the boy, who was struck three times in the torso and once in the hand, Kent said.

He was pronounced dead shortly before 4:30 a.m. today, Kent said. The deputies, whose names have not been released, were not injured in the shooting and have been placed on paid administrative leave, the spokesman said. The involved deputies were a six-year veteran and a two-year veteran, according to Kent. Investigators are looking into the circumstances leading up to the incident, Kent said. The Santa Cruz County District Attorneys Office is also conducting a separate investigation into the shooting, Kent said.

800,"The family of a man killed by Wichita police in a swatting hoax last month filed a federal lawsuit against the city Monday that said its police officers are more likely to be involved in shootings than their counterparts nationwide and should be held accountable along with the man accused of making the bogus call. Andrew Finch, 28, was unarmed when he was shot and killed by a police officer the evening of Dec. 28 after a team of officers dressed in full tactical gear responded to the fake 911 call that seemed to report a kidnapping in progress at his Wichita home. Instead, investigators have said, the call originated from California and was made as part of the Call of Duty online game in which players try to get police SWAT teams to respond to someones home. Tyler Raj Barriss, 25, of Los Angeles, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter, giving false alarm and interference with a law enforcement officer. He could face up to 11 years in prison if convicted. Barriss was not named as a defendant in the familys civil rights lawsuit. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Kansas, names the city of Wichita and 10 police officers as defendants and seeks damages in excess of $75,000. Andrew Stroth, the familys civil rights attorney, was not immediately available for comment. Patch will update this story if we hear back. Wichita police thought they were dealing with a hostage situation after receiving a call that gave Finchs address and in which the caller claimed he had shot his father in the head, was holding other family members hostage and planned to set the house on fire. When Finch went outside to see what was going on, police told him to keep his hands in the air. Finch was shot by an officer who believed he was reaching for a gun, Wichita police said in a news conference a day after the fatal shooting. The irresponsible actions of a prankster put peoples lives at risk, Wichita Deputy Police Chief Troy Livingston said at the time. The incident is a nightmare for everyone involved. Stroth told ABC News that Finchs family wants Barriss held criminally responsible, but said the swatter didnt shoot the bullet that killed Andy Finch. Responsibility for that case resides in that officer that used his high-powered rifle to shoot and kill Andy. He said city and police officials in Wichita are trying to place the blame entirely on Barriss, but should also be held accountable. The family wants justice and reform so other families wont have to experience the same tragedy, Stroh told The Associated Press. His law firm, the Action Injury Law Group in Chicago, specializes in police shootings nationwide. The lawsuit alleges that Wichita police officers are quicker to draw their weapons than other officers nationwide. Wichita Police Department officers were involved in 29 shootings, resulting in 15 deaths, from 2010-2015. The lawsuit also cites FBI crime statistics that show Wichita has a ratio of one shooting death for every 120 officers, a number that is 11 times greater than the national ratio and 12 times greater than the ratio in Chicago. The FBI doesnt collect statistics about swatting, but warned of the consequences of the prank as early as 2008. The agency told The Verge in 2013 that an estimated 400 swatting attacks occur annually. How can Wichita police department officers not be trained to deal with this type of situation? Stroth told The AP. Swatting is not new, prank calls are not new. Lisa Finch, Andrew Finchs mother, told ABC that police didnt announce themselves the night of the fatal swatting call, stormed their home and placed the family in handcuffs. The police never announced themselves nor did they knock on the door, they never once let us know who was here, not one time, Lisa Finch said. Barris, who has waived extradition to Kansas, is known as a serial swatter who has made at least 20 similar calls. After Finch was killed, he told KABC-TV in a jail interview that he didnt intend for anyone to get shot and killed. I just wish I could have rewound somehow and just never done it, he said. The Wichita Police Department and Kansas Bureau of Investigation conducted an investigation, and the case is under review by the Sedgwick County District Attorney. The police department is also conducting an internal review. None of the officers involved in the response has been named. Finch has two children, a boy, 7, and a girl, who is almost 2. Andy Finch was an innocent victim, a 28-year-old man with two children, who lost his life because of an overzealous police officer and his high-powered rifle felt a threat that did not exist, Stroth told ABC. Andy Fitch should be alive today. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Photo via Shutterstock",0

806,"Royal Oak police said a Saturday morning report that a man had barricaded himself inside a house and taken two hostages at a house in the 1100 block of royal was actually an instance of swatting, a hoax that has been sweeping the country. Royal Oak police and the Southeast Oakland County SWAT team responded to the residence about 11:04 a.m. after receiving a 911 call in which an unknown suspect claimed he had stabbed two females at the residence and was armed with a shotgun, according to a police statement. Police established a perimeter and advised neighbors to remain in their homes. The annual Mind Over Matter 5K run/walk was diverted to ensure the safety of the race participants. After about an hour officers began to realize this may be a swatting call, which is a term commonly used to describe a false report causing a significant police response, Royal Oak police said in a news release. Related: During the incident, police made contact with a man inside the house, who was working at his computer in the basement and was unaware of the heavy police presence outside his residence. After interviewing him, police realized they had been punked. False reports of this nature create a very dangerous situation for responding emergency services and the community, police said in the statement. The person who called in this fake report committed a felony, which carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. In a similar hoax last year, police in West Bloomfield dispatched a special operations team after receiving a call from a man who claimed he had shot his wife with an AK-47, planted explosives throughout the condo, and taken a neighbor hostage and killed him. Also last year, Oakland County sheriffs deputies responded to a residence in Independence Township after getting a call that a man with a machine gun had taken hostages. The FBI says swatting has resulted in some close calls, including the injury of a police officer en route to a hoax. Also, the FBI said, some victims have suffered mild heart attacks when SWAT teams show up at their doors. The hoaxes are usually the work of a computer hacker whos able to make it seem a call came from a specific address.",1

816,"Fenton parents are urging others to keep an extra close eye on their children after another possible attempted abduction was reported in Linden on Thursday. People need to keep out an eye on kids who are out and about without parents, said Kathleen Davis, Fenton mother of a 4-year-old. It is surprising that its happening in this area. There seems to be rash of it. The Fenton Press reported Thursday that Linden Police are searching for a man who allegedly attempted to abduct an 8-year-old boy out of his front yard Thursday morning. The article stated the boy was playing in the front yard of his house on Murphy Street, near North Bridge Street, at about 9:45 a.m. when he heard a door slam and the boy was grabbed from behind by a man. The boy started screaming for help, according to the Fenton Press, and kicked the suspect, who then dropped the boy and left. The Fenton Press stated the suspect is described as 19 to 30 years old and 6 feet tall. He has dark hair and was wearing black shorts and a blue T-shirt and was driving a tan/brownish Suburban/Yukon-type vehicle and left in an unknown direction. This is possibly the second alleged abduction attempt in the area in the last two weeks. On May 31, that police said two men approached two young girls near . Fenton Police Chief Rick Aro said two young girls were playing with a scooter in front of the school around 7 p.m. May 28 when the girls reported the vehicle then pulled up on the grass near them and two males in black T-shirts got out of the vehicle and began chasing them. The girls reported they ran home and went inside to tell their parents about the situation. The father told police that he came out of the residence and observed two males running toward the vehicle. They initially picked up the scooter and tried to load it into the vehicle, he reported, but then left it and fled the scene. Initially, Aro said police thought the suspects were pursuing the girls, but after watching the video footage, it is unclear whether they targeted the girls or the scooter. Its very concerning. Its very scary, said Fenton parent Angela Frazee. I have seven children at home and to have them play outside makes me very uncomfortable. Its too bad you cant play in your own yard and feel safe. Frazee thinks there should be extra police patrols and days when many children are outside. I think our tax dollars could pay for that, she said. It can happen anywhere.",0
817,"DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN — A man who shoved his girlfriend into the trunk of his car, drove her from Long Island to Brooklyn, then kept her tied up in his home for hours has been charged with kidnapping, police said. Arturo Gurley, 20, lured his 19-year-old girlfriend out of her car in Elmont, New York on Wednesday around 12:30 a.m., Nassau police said. Gurley pushed the terrified woman into the trunk of his own car, but not before grabbing her cellphone and keys, according to police. Gurleys girlfriend spent the next 45 minutes curled up in the trunk as he sped toward downtown Brooklyn, police said Gurley stopped the car near Navy and Fleet walks, pulled his girlfriend out of the trunk and dragged her into the Ingersoll Houses, said police. Once inside his apartment, Gurley shoved a sock in his girlfriends mouth and sealed her lips shut with duct tape, said police. She sat there for about five hours before Gurley let her go, said police. The woman rushed home and called the police, who arrested Gurley in his home around 1:50 a.m. Friday, police said.

819,"One of the four defendants who allegedly tied up and tormented a mentally challenged Crystal Lake man and streamed video footage of the torture on Facebook in 2017 rejected a plea deal from prosecutors during a brief hearing Tuesday. Jordan Hill, 19, turned down the agreement that would have sentenced him to eight years in prison if he pleaded guilty to aggravated kidnapping and a hate crime, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Hill was arrested and charged along with Tesfaye Cooper, 19, Brittany Covington, 19, and Tanishia Covington, 25, in connection with the Jan. 3, 2017, incident. The four defendants are accused of binding the then-18-year-old victim with duct tape before beating and taunting him for hours at the West Side apartment of the Covingtons, who are sisters. While captive, the victim, who is white, had his clothes and hair cut and was forced to drink water from a toilet bowl. The defendants, who are black, can be heard shouting, F--- Donald Trump! and F--- white people! in the video that captured the brutal incident, which was streamed live on Facebook. The four defendants face various charges stemming from the alleged attack, including aggravated kidnapping, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and a hate crime. More Patch Coverage: Hill also has been accused of setting in motion the disturbing events of January by picking up the victim in a stolen van New Years Eve of 2016. The two teens had been classmates at a school in Aurora, and the judge in the case has accused Hill of using that past relationship to gain — and then betray — the victims trust. Initially, all four defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges in February. But in December of last year, Brittany Covington struck a deal with prosecutors, and she pleaded guilty to the hate crime, aggravated battery and intimidation charges. In exchange for changing her plea, Covington was put on probation for four years, and she could be required to testify against the other defendants. The kidnapping count against her also was dropped, but she is prohibited from using social media for four years and must complete 200 hours of community service. During his time in jail, Hill and two other inmates are accused of attacking and injuring another inmate in a Dec. 8 jail brawl. He was charged with misdemeanor battery in the skirmish.

820,"An Arkansas man has been sentenced to life in prison without parole after pleading guilty to killing a sheriffs deputy and two other people last month. Little Rock television station KATV reports James Arthur Bowden was sentenced Friday after taking a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. Bowden was accused in the killings of Yell County Sheriffs Deputy Lt. Kevin Mainhart, 61-year-old Rita Miller and 17-year-old Ciera Miller. Family members have said the Millers were relatives of Bowdens girlfriend. (For more local news, click here to sign up for real-time news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports Bowden addressed the families of the three people killed in court Friday. Im really sorry about what happened, Bowden said. I cant be forgiven, so I wont ask. According to an affidavit, authorities accused Bowden of shooting Mainhart during a traffic stop, then killing Rita Miller and Ciera Miller at a nearby home about 65 miles (105 kilometers) west of Little Rock. Bowden surrendered to police after an hours-long standoff at a house near Dardanelle, in which he was accused of holding his girlfriend hostage. The woman was eventually let go. Bowdens sister, Julie Inmon, previously told The Associated Press after the shootings that her brother was mentally ill and that she spoke to her brother by phone during the standoff. She said her brother has taken anti-psychotic medication and anti-depressants for his mental illness in the past. Authorities have not confirmed that. Mainhart was an officer in Yell County for five years and had previously worked for the West Memphis Police Department for more than 20 years. He is the first of two Arkansas police officers to be killed in the line of duty this year. Newport Police Lt. Patrick Weatherford was fatally shot earlier this month while investigating a break-in in Newport, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northeast of Little Rock.

821,"Jurors in Jacksonville needed just 8 minutes on Wednesday to convict 61-year-old Donald Smith of abducting, raping and murdering 8-year-old Cherish Perrywinkle. The courtroom had just gone into recess after the judge read instructions to the jurors when everyone quickly returned. The white-haired Smith, wearing shirt and plaid tie, watched without expression as the jury foreman quickly read through the verdicts. Cherish was abducted from a Walmart in 2013. Smith convinced her mother that he would buy the poor family some clothes with a gift card. Smith had introduced himself as a good Samaritan to the mother, Rayne Perrywinkle, at a discount store earlier in the day, saying his wife would meet them at the Walmart and bring the card. The wife never showed, and Smith instead lured Cherish away from her mother and two sisters as they shopped. It got late, and the mother said she hadnt fed the girls so Smith offered to go to a McDonalds located in the front of the store and get them some cheeseburgers. Cherish followed Smith through the store. The McDonalds was closed, and surveillance footage showed the girl following Smith out of the store and getting into his white van. To the untrained eye he looks like Uncle Joe who is shopping with Rayne and the kids, prosecutor Mark Caliel said during his closing argument Wednesday morning. He made her feel safe through his lies and deception, Caliel said. And then he preyed upon her. He drove her out of that parking lot of the Walmart to where no eyes could see and no ears could hear. After about 20 minutes Rayne testified that she realized something was wrong. She didnt have a working cellphone, so she borrowed one from a Walmart worker and called 911. By then it was too late. Cherishs battered body was found in a Jacksonville creek, still adorned in the orange dress with a fruit print. When police arrested Smith his pants were wet. Later, technicians found his DNA all over her body. The jury was shown gruesome photographs of Cherishs body. While testifying about the girls injuries the citys chief medical examiner had to interrupt her testimony because she became too emotional while talking about it. Caliel told the jurors they would never forget the images they were forced to see. They will forever be a part of your memory. Burned into your memory, he said. The jury was ordered to return to court Tuesday to begin the penalty phase of the trial. Smith faces a possible death sentence. He was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping and sexual battery on a child less than 12 years of age.

822,"A Dedham man charged with kidnapping and raping a woman has been found guilty on all counts. A Suffolk County Superior Court jury found Dwayne McNair, 36, eight counts of aggravated rape and two counts of armed robbery, according to the Suffolk County District Attorneys office. We left no stone unturned in the 13-year history of this case, Conley said. When we heard of cutting-edge DNA testing that could distinguish between identical twins, we utilized it. Although a judge ruled the results were not admissible, they only strengthened our commitment to bring the case to trial. We were deeply gratified that the jury recognized the defendants guilt even without that powerful evidence, and I hope they recognize that their verdicts took a dangerous sexual predator off of Bostons streets. The conviction is the second in the case. Anwar Thomas, 35, pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2012. McNairs case was complicated by the fact that he has an identical twin brother. Thomas testified that he could tell the difference between the two. Prosecutors alleged that on Sept. 21, 2004, McNair and Thomas abducted a woman who was walking alone in the area of Forest Hills at gunpoint, and subsequently pistol-whipped her before driving her to a remote location where they allegedly sexually assaulted and robbed her. On Sept. 29, the two allegedly abducted another woman walking alone at night in the area of Parker and Hillside streets in Roxbury, where they allegedly forced her into a vehicle, struck her several times in the face with a gun and sexually assaulted her, while also stealing her cell phone, wallet and ID, according to the DAs office. The victim of the second attack took a condom one of the men had used and discarded, from which Boston police were able to retrieve DNA, which later implicated McNair. At the time of the investigation, available DNA testing could not differentiate between McNair and his twin brother, and police and prosecutors subsequently secured additional evidence and testimony showing that McNair was the one who allegedly took part in the attacks, the DAs office said. Jurors did not hear testimony on a DNA test that, according to experts, showed that McNair was two billions times more likely to be the source of the crime scene DNA than his brother. We left no stone unturned in the 13-year history of this case, District Attorney Dan Conley said in a release. When we heard of cutting-edge DNA testing that could distinguish between identical twins, we utilized it. Although a judge ruled the results were not admissible, they only strengthened our commitment to bring the case to trial.

823,"A 19-year-old township student feared for his life while he was kidnapped by a man police said forced him to get money and drive around Paterson so he could get drugs and solicit prostitutes. A student from Passaic County Technical Institute was at the drive-thru window at McDonalds at Hamburg Turnpike and Hinchman Avenue at 9 p.m. Thursday when Travis Mann asked to use his cell phone to contact his family, said Detective Capt. Laurence Martin. The man got into the students truck and threatened to harm him if he did not drive him to Paterson to purchase drugs; Mann was allegedly smoking synthetic marijuana and acted very irrationally, Martin said. Mann forced the student to withdraw $190 from his checking account at ATMs, drive him to Paterson where he purchased and smoked crack cocaine and solicited prostitutes, the captain said. The victim said he feared for his life, Martin said. Mann, 35, allegedly told the student to drive him to his hometown of Wanaque where, at about 3 a.m. Friday, the victim escaped from Mann, contacted the manager at a 7-Eleven, who called 9-1-1, Martin said. A Wanaque Police officer immediately responded to the scene and struggled with Mann, who tried to run, before taking him into custody, Martin said. Mann was wearing an ankle bracelet, which he showed to the student, stemming from him allegedly robbing an Elmwood Park Walgreens Feb. 25, police said. Mann acted disorderly and threatened officers while being processed at Wanaque Police headquarters, Martin said. He was then taken to Wayne Police headquarters where he continued to act irrationally; he was placed in a holding cell before being taken to the Passaic County Jail, he said. Mann was charged out of Wayne with carjacking and kidnapping. Wanaque Police charged him with making terroristic threats, hindering apprehension, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, failure to surrender narcotics to law enforcement, possession of crack cocaine, tampering of evidence, obstruction and possession of drug paraphernalia.

835,"By PAUL ANDERSON An Orange County judge Thursday rejected a bid by prosecutors to call former kidnapping victim Elizabeth Smart-Gilmour as an expert witness in the trial of a man accused of kidnapping his former live-in girlfriends teenage daughter in Santa Ana and sexually assaulting her over 10 years. Prosecutors said they wanted to put Smart on the stand in the trial of Isidro Medrano Garcia, saying there were similarities between her abduction and that of the alleged victim in Garcias case. They claimed that like Smart, the victim in Garcias case didnt take advantage of multiple opportunities to escape because she was being manipulated by her captor. But Judge Michael Leversen, after hearing testimony from Smart outside the jurys presence, said he did not find enough evidence for Smart to be called as an expert in this particular case. Leversen noted Smart survived a horrific experience, and found her to be an honest, credible witness. However, she has not provided sufficient foundation to qualify as an expert in this case, Leversen said. Senior Deputy District Attorney Whitney Bokosky argued that the crux of this case is whether (the victim) was kidnapped, and whether the jury believes she was forced to live with her alleged captor. The defense will be attacking (the victims) credibility, Bokosky said. Bokosky likened it to a police officer testifying from his personal experience with drug dealers in a drug-related criminal trial. Garcias attorney, Seth Bank, argued Smarts fear of escape was far more understandable than the victim in his clients case. Smart testified that her captors consistently threatened to kill her and her family if she tried to get away. Her behavior was completely reasonable, Bank said of her reluctance to seek help. Bank said it would be more appropriate for a psychiatric expert to testify in the case and that most of Smarts knowledge of other kidnap victims experiences is just anecdotal stuff. Smart was kidnapped from her familys home in Salt Lake City on June 5, 2002, at age 14. Her disappearance made national headlines, and police ultimately rescued her nine months later. Smart said she was sexually assaulted on a daily basis while being held captive and threatened if she tried to escape. Her story became the subject of a made-for-TV movie and she co-wrote a book about her experiences that she said enriched her by about $300,000. Smart said her experience was much like the victims in Garcias case. She was being manipulated and held hostage by verbal chains as opposed to physical chains, Smart testified. The threat of deportation and then later the fear of losing custody of her child were the prime discouragement from seeking escape, Smart testified. Garcia, 42, of Bell Gardens, is charged with forcible rape, kidnapping to commit a sex offense and three counts of lewd acts on a minor. Garcias alleged victim, then 15, was reported missing in August 2004 by her mother, who suspected Garcia, her one-time live-in boyfriend, of abducting her daughter, police said. The mother also suspected at that time that Garcia had been sexually abusing the teen for about two months, according to investigators. Garcia met the girl in February 2004 and would buy her gifts and take her side when the teen quarreled with her mother, according to prosecutors. Garcia is accused of molesting and kissing the girl between June and August of 2004, according to prosecutors. He sexually assaulted the girl three different times and raped her once, prosecutors allege. Garcia is accused of forcing his captive into marriage in 2007 and had a child with her in 2012. His attorney has contended that the alleged victim had multiple chances to leave the defendant over the course of 10 years and go to authorities, but failed to do so.

843,"A Georgia man convicted of killing his sister-in-law with a shotgun then kidnapping and sexually assaulting his estranged wife has been scheduled for execution on Tuesday. Keith Leroy Tharpe, 59, would become the second person executed by lethal injection in Georgia this year and the 71st person put to death in the state since the death penalty was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976. That is a slower pace than 2016, when Georgia executed nine condemned inmates. According to court documents, Tharpe, on Sept. 24, 1990, met up with his estranged wife and sister-in-law in middle Georgias Jones County, using his vehicle to block them then getting out brandishing a shotgun. Apparently under the influence of drugs, Tharpe, who had repeatedly threatened his wife and her family with violence, shot his sister-in-law — 29-year-old Jacquelin Freeman — with the shotgun, rolled her into a ditch, reloaded and shot her again. He then kidnapped his wife. After unsuccessfully trying to rent a motel room, he parked by the side of a road and raped her, court documents say. Afterward, he drove her to Macon, where she was supposed to get money from her credit union. Instead, she called police. On January 18, 1991, Tharpe was sentenced to death after a Jones County jury found him guilty of malice murder and two counts of kidnapping with bodily injury. (SIGN UP:Get Patchs Daily Newsletter and Real Time News Alerts. Or, if you have an iPhone, download the free Patch app.) Tharpe is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 7 p.m. at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson. Lawyers for Tharpe have petitioned the state Board of Pardons and Paroles for clemency in the case. The petition says Tharpe was addicted to crack cocaine and alcohol when he committed the crimes — addictions he has overcome while in prison. Without in any way discounting or minimizing Mrs. Freemans death and the pain caused by Mr. Tharpes crime, we ask the Board to consider who Mr. Tharpe is today: a man full of remorse, living every day guided by his faith, respect, and good will, who strives to put as much good into the world as he can, which he will continue to do if allowed to live out the remainder of his natural life in prison, the petition reads. The document notes that at least some of Freemans family members support clemency in the case and that his conviction and sentence possibly were tainted by racism, citing a jury member who was quoted using a racial slur when referring to Tharpe. According to the state Department of Corrections, Tharpe has requested a last meal of three spicy chicken breasts, a roast beef sandwich with sauce, a fish sandwich, tater logs, onion rings, an apple pie and a vanilla milkshake. Tharpe would become the 48th inmate put to death since Georgia switched to lethal injection. There are presently 56 men under death sentence in Georgia. Death row inmate J.W.

Ricardo Colindres, 26, is a transient with family ties to Brisbane on the Peninsula, Lodi in San Joaquin County and Burson in Calaveras County. He also frequents Las Vegas, Deputy U.S. Marshal Joseph Palmer said. Listed among Northern Californias Most Wanted, he is sought by the Pacifica Police Department, along with the U.S. Marshals, for suspicion of attempted murder and attempted kidnapping. On April 27, at the Casa Pacifica Apartments in Pacifica, Colindres allegedly tried to abduct his ex-girlfriend, who was eight months pregnant, before he shot her in the head. Witnesses heard Colindres arguing with the victim that morning just before a gunshot and screaming, Pacifica police said. Colindres fled the apartment on Terra Nova Boulevard just after 8 a.m. and has not been reported seen since, Palmer said. He was quickly identified as a suspect, and his name and description were released to the media. Police asked the public to be on the lookout for Colindres and his 2003 silver Toyota Camry, license plate number 6CGN644. U.S. Marshals initially offered a reward of $2,500 for information leading to the location, arrest and conviction of Colindres. We are continuing to investigate this case to the fullest extent possible, said U.S. Marshal Don OKeefe. We feel that Colindres still being at large is unacceptable, and we encourage the public to assist us in locating and safely apprehending him. The victim in the case deserves justice and closure, which she is being denied every day he remains on the streets, OKeefe said. For her sake, and the sake of public safety, we implore those with any knowledge of him or his possible whereabouts to contact law enforcement immediately.

847,"A Maryland man who created a false alarm in 2015 has been sentenced to two years in prison, the U.S. Attorneys Office said. The sentence stems from a case of swatting, or faking an emergency that would merit a SWAT team response. Prosecutors said the incident cost the Howard County Police Department approximately $10,000 and resulted in injuries to the victim that required multiple reconstructive surgeries. Zachary Lee, 26, of Catonsville, pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to provide false information as well as false information and hoax relating to a scheme to cause an emergency services response. Lee admitted that between Feb. 17 and Feb. 18, 2015, he and another man plotted to create a fake hostile scenario, officials said. The other man, 19-year-old Robert Walker-McDaid of Coventry, England, has an extradition hearing scheduled for March 27 in the United Kingdom, prosecutors reported. Lee admitted that he contacted McDaid over an internet messaging service and said: I have someone I need sw@tted, according to the plea agreement. Authorities said that McDaid called the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Centers Terrorism hotline demanding $15,000 in cash be delivered to an address in Ellicott City where he pretended he had three hostages, a bag of explosives and a loaded gun on Feb. 18, 2015. The caller stated that he would start executing the hostages in 15 minutes if his demands were not met, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney. Shortly after police arrived at the address, Lee allegedly posted on his Facebook account, Love my team. More than 40 officers responded to an unsuspecting victims home, where they stayed for more than two and a half hours and found upon investigation the victim did not make the call, had no hostages and was not in possession of firearms or explosives, officials said. A Howard County Police Department tactical team, unaware that the emergency was fabricated, shot the victim with rubber bullets in the chest and face, according to the U.S. Attorney. The victim suffered significant injuries to his face and chest, including bruised lungs, a fractured rib and numerous broken bones to the left side of his face, the district attorney said. He was transported to the hospital, where he underwent approximately three facial reconstructive surgeries. The prank that Lee admitted to orchestrating is known as swatting because it involves getting police to send SWAT teams to someones home. While the number of incidents has risen in recent years — the FBI estimates there are 400 swatting incidents each year — one that occurred in late December 2017 in Wichita, Kansas, is believed to be the first to result in a fatal shooting. For the incident in Maryland, United States District Judge Marvin J. Garbis sentenced Lee to serve two years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. Image via Shutterstock.",0

Aurora police have answered several calls in the past week and so far have not learned of anyone giving into the demands and losing any money.  Although there have been variations reported to Aurora police, the attempted scams generally begin when a phone call is received and the caller does not identify themselves. They go on to tell whoever answers the phone that one of their family members, whom they call by name, has been involved in an accident and he or she is being held hostage. They then demand money or the family member will be killed. The telephone numbers from which the calls are supposedly being placed are mostly local area codes. Some of the calls have come from scammers fluent in Spanish.  Police say the targets of these calls become upset mostly because family members are mentioned by name and that the calls seem to be placed locally. However, police would like to remind citizens that the detailed information is easily accessible via the Internet or social media and specialized devices can spoof caller IDs to indicate local calls.  Police say anyone receiving similar calls can verify the well-being of their family member by calling or texting their cell phone.

855,"SAN JOSE - A man who allegedly kidnapped cats in San Joses Cambrian Park neighborhood last year is now facing 21 charges, a majority that pertain to animal cruelty. Robert Roy Farmer was charged with 11 new felonies related to animal cruelty that were submitted Wednesday when he appeared at the Hall of Justice in San Jose, Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Alexandra Ellis said. Each new charge represents a feline victim identified through testing of blood and DNA found on Farmers clothing and vehicle, Ellis said. The court granted the prosecutions request to raise Farmers bail to $225,000, Ellis said. Farmer faces a sentence of up to 16 years in county jail in light of the added charges, according to Ellis.

857,"A grand jury indicted a Newark man on several charges Tuesday after he allegedly grabbed a 13-year-old girl around the neck and threatened to kill her in front of her father during a recent carjacking in Short Hills. According to the New Jersey Attorney Generals Office, Ahmed Anthony, 30, of Newark, and two unidentified co-conspirators allegedly ambushed a Short Hills family around 1:48 a.m. on Nov. 27, 2017 as they returned to their home from vacation on Thanksgiving weekend. After the mother and an older child went into the house, the 13-year-old girl and her father were bringing luggage toward the home from their Range Rover, when Anthony allegedly grabbed the teen from behind in a choke hold and pulled her back towards the car, prosecutors said. At that point, the father allegedly heard another man yell out: Give me your keys or I will kill your daughter. The father then turned to see two men, one of whom was holding his daughter. The second assailant approached him with what appeared to be a handgun, then demanded that he hand over his money and the keys to the familys Range Rover. When the father handed over the keys, the second man took off in the vehicle, prosecutors said. According to prosecutors: At that point, the father and daughter went back into the house. The father then grabbed a handgun and went outside to confront Anthony, who was unable to make his getaway because he was having trouble starting the vehicle, prosecutors said. The father pointed the gun at Anthony and ordered him to get on the ground. He later told police that Anthony got out of the car, but then fled into the street on foot, where a third conspirator picked him up in a minivan, prosecutors said. Following a police investigation, Anthony was arrested on Jan. 11 by the New Jersey State Police Fugitive Unit, the Millburn Police Department, the U.S. Marshals Service NY/NJ Regional Task Force Newark Division and the New Jersey State Police Auto Theft Task Force. He was ordered detained pending trial following his arrest, prosecutors said. Millburn Police Chief Brian Gilfedder said Tuesday that a police investigation continues for the other two suspects involved. On Tuesday, an 11-count state grand jury indictment charged Anthony with: This indictment reflects our commitment to meet this type of violent crime with aggressive prosecutions, said Director Elie Honig of the Division of Criminal Justice. The first-degree carjacking charges Anthony faces carry a sentence of up to 30 years in prison, including mandatory parole ineligibility equal to 85 percent of the sentence imposed. Prosecutors said that the other first-degree charges carry a sentence of 10 to 20 years in state prison and a fine of up to $200,000. The charges of carjacking and robbery carry a mandatory minimum period of parole ineligibility equal to 85 percent of the sentence imposed. Second-degree crimes carry a sentence of five to 10 years in state prison and a fine of up to $150,000.

Bob Long of the LAPDs Robbery-Homicide Division. A second Jordanian man arrived in a getaway vehicle during what appeared to be a pre-planned abduction, and both men drove off with the girl, Long said.

861,"The FBI said new evidence in the Ashanti Billie case includes DNA from her alleged killer that was collected from multiple locations in Billies car, according to reports. NBC Washington reports the FBI took DNA samples from Billies steering wheel, gear shift, headlight switch, and turn signal. In a court testimony Tuesday, officials said the samples match Eric Brian Brown, the 45-year-old retired Navy veteran who was arrested Nov. 8 for Billies kidnapping. Brown allegedly abducted Billie on Sept. 18 as she arrived for work at the Blimpies restaurant on Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek in Norfolk, Virginia, federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia said. Billie, who is originally a Prince Georges County native, was a student at The Art Institute of Virginia Beach at the time. She never showed up for work Sept. 18 and was then reported missing. Her body was found 11 days later and more than 300 miles away in Charlotte, North Carolina. Prosectors said Browns DNA was also found on Billies body. His DNA was taken from a swab of the pocket openings of Billies hooded sweatshirt and a swab of the outside, back center torso area of her shirt. Brown allegedly flirted with Billie at Blimpies on several occasions. A witness also recalled hearing a conversation where Brown made a crude sexual comment to Billie, who was a 2016 graduate from Henry Wise High School in Upper Marlboro. Her remains were located in a wooded area behind a church on Greirs Grove Road Sept. 29, about 300 yards from Browns childhood home, prosecutors said. See Related: Brown, who served in the military for 21 years, worked as a day laborer and participated in the construction of the Blimpies this past summer. He is believed to be homeless and lives at random facilities and buildings on and off the naval bases, prosecutors said. According to court documents, a review of Browns phones web history shows that Brown made numerous searches on Sept. 19, including police looking for man, Norfolk police looking for man in connection with homicide, amber alert sept 2017, missing woman and baby, and missing woman and man. Billies phone was recovered in a dumpster near the corner of Tallyho Terrace and Azalea Garden Road in Norfolk, about three miles from where she was last seen, Sept. 18. Her car was located in the 9500 block of Lakeside Dr. in the Ocean View area of Norfolk Sept. 23. NBC Washington also reports that Brown told a law enforcement informant after Billies body was found that he hates black women. According to court documents, Brown said they are gold diggers who only want guys with all the money. Brown has been charged with kidnapping and faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted. Photo: Billie via FBI, Brown via Virginia Beach Sheriffs Office",1
862,"A massive search is underway for Kathlynn Shepard, 15, in Webster County after authorities said she and another girl were abducted Monday. Authorities said a suspect, Michael J.

Airplanes equipped with FLIR technology and law enforcement K-9s are also working. The abduction comes less than a year after Evansdale cousins and murdered while riding their bikes on a sunny July day. The search for their kidnapper is ongoing. Patch is reprinting safety tips from Evansdale Police Chief Kent Smock in light of Mondays abduction. Safety Tips from Evansdale Police Chief Kent Smock: As the weather begins to change and move toward warmer temperatures, children will be spending more time outdoors and away from the immediate supervision of their parents. We would like to take this opportunity to remind parents to talk with their children about their safety, before they venture out. A few simple rules are: 1) Remind your children to NEVER talk to or accept any gifts from strangers. 2) Play in groups of friends and avoid isolated areas where others cannot easily see them. 3) If someone approaches and asks or tries to force them to accompany them, they should refuse and resist, making as much noise as possible to draw attention to them. 4) They should keep a schedule to check in with parents or guardians on a regular basis. 5) If they feel uncomfortable about their surroundings, listen to those feelings and go to a place of safety, whether an open business, friends house, or police or fire station. Call their parent or guardian from there as well as police, if needed. As parents and adults, we need you to be aware of children playing around your home or place of business. Look out windows and doors frequently and watch over children in the area. If you see anything suspicious, immediately call law enforcement and give them a good description of what you see, including the license plate number of any vehicle that may be involved. Keep watching and if necessary, before police arrive, step in and ask questions. We would like to encourage all our neighbors to take an active part in continuing to make our neighborhoods a safe place for our children to be.  Keeping our children safe is everyones responsibility and we ask that everyone play a role to ensure everyone has a pleasant and safe spring and summer.

863,"Three of the four suspects connected with the Oct. 25 shooting of 26-year-old Donald Thomas appeared in Pierce County Superior Court today to face charges of kidnapping, attempted robbery and felony harassment. While all four will face jury trials for their roles in Thomas death, none have been charged with homicide. Thomas was allegedly at a Bonney Lake residence to rob its residents and the lethal shots appeared to be in self-defense, said Phil Sorensen, Chief Deputy Prosecutor for Pierce County. If additional information comes through that looks like we should change our minds, we can certainly can do so, but at this point its not anticipated that any homicide charges will be filed, said Sorensen.  Theres still an investigation going on, so other charges—specifically drug charges—could be coming. Three of the defendants—Colton E. Geeson, 20; Michael A. Edwards, 35; and Job M. Edwards of Bonney Lake, 33—appeared in court today for their arraignment. The fourth suspect, Krystal Frietas, 32, did not appear due to illness so her court date is pending. THE CRIME According to the charging documents in this case, Geeson called 911 to report a shooting at a duplex on the 19200 block of 75th Ave. E. in Bonney Lake around 4 p.m. on Oct. 25. He met officers at the scene and told them he and Thomas were friends, and they were there to rob homeowners of their drugs. During the course of the robbery, Thomas was shot in the head. Geeson said the homeowners held him at gunpoint, and they told him that he was going to die too. After Thomas was shot, Geeson was ordered to move his car into the garage so Thomas body could be placed in it. He did so but managed to escape on foot from the garage before the door closed and called police. According to documents, after speaking to Geeson, investigators surveyed the residence. About the same time, Michael Edwards observed one of the detectives at the residence and called 911 to report a burglary. Still, police took him and Job Edwards, who was sitting on the stairs outside the home, into custody. Frietas was taken into custody after she was forced to exit the home. She is Michaels girlfriend and lives at the residence with him and Job, according to investigators. Initially, Michael Edwards told police that Thomas and Geeson broke into his house, and Thomas had a handgun. Eventually, he admitted that the two men were there to buy prescription painkillers from Frietas, according to documents. Frietas told police that the two men were at her home to purchase drugs when Thomas produced a gun and started to struggle with Michael Edwards. She said Thomas fired his gun several times but denied seeing Michael Edwards with his own gun. Michael Edwards allegedly disarmed Thomas, who fled down the stairs. Thomas ran into Job Edwards, who was coming up the stairs after he heard the commotion, armed with his own handgun. Job Edwards said he fired six or seven shots at Thomas. Michael Edwards admitted to shooting Thomas as well. Investigators said Thomas was shot at close range in his head, the back of his neck, hips and back. After Thomas fell, Michael Edwards admitted to dragging his body into the garage so that he could be placed in Geesons car. Investigators found Thomas on the floor of the garage. Several spent shell castings plus a 12-gauge shotgun, a .40 caliber handgun and .45 caliber handgun were recovered from the scene. After the shooting, Frietas admitted to police that she loaded a car with evidence from the scene and drove it to a nearby apartment complex and left it there. That car has since been recovered and is currently being processed. CHARGES FILED At Mondays arraignment, Geeson was charged with first-degree attempted robbery. His bail is set at $150,000. Frietas and the two Edwards men have all been charged with first-degree kidnapping and felony harassment for knowingly threatening and detaining Greeson during the robbery. A $250,000 bail has been set on all three individuals. The Edwards men are both convicted felons and could also face potential charges for unlawful possession of a firearm, if they were found to be illegal, said Sorensen. Authorities must investigate their past convictions before adding the firearm charges. If convicted, Frietas and the two Edwards men could face 10 to 12 years in prison for their charges. Geeson faces 6 years in prison for first-degree robbery. Geeson does not have a felony record—he was charged with misdemeanor crimes as a minor but his records are sealed. A jury trial for the four individuals is scheduled for Dec. 17, 2012 in Pierce County Superior Court.",1
864,"Three friends of Sierra LaMar were called to the witness stand Thursday afternoon in the trial of Antolin Garcia-Torres, the man accused of her murder and of the attempted kidnappings of three women in 2009. Sierra, who lived just north of Morgan Hill, has not been seen or heard from since the morning of March 16, 2012, when she was 15. Prosecutors have argued that Garcia-Torres DNA is on Sierras clothing, which was found in a field after her disappearance along with other personal items including her lunch money, makeup and inhaler. Defense attorney Al Lopez has responded that DNA cross-contamination during the evidence collection process has jeopardized that evidence as well as evidence found in Garcia-Torres Volkswagen Jetta, where prosecutor David Boyd has said Sierras DNA was found. Karissa Pugh, Claire Normoyle and Brittany Stonehouse, all classmates and friends of Sierra who saw and talked to her regularly before she disappeared, each testified that Sierra had not shown any sign or had any obvious reason to want to leave her friends and family as a runaway. Each woman told Boyd that to her knowledge, Sierra had no passport, drivers license, bank account, credit card, source of money other than her parents or anywhere to stay other than with her family. In his cross-examination, Lopez asked Pugh whether a state ID or credit card was needed to set up an email or social media account, seeming to suggest that Sierra could have had a secret life away from her friends, a question that Superior Court Judge Vanessa Zecher said was going a little far afield. Lopez also attempted to lay the groundwork for the case that the DNA found on Sierras clothing could have belonged to someone other than Garcia-Torres. Lopez asked Stonehouse whether she would have washed her custom San Jose Sharks sweatshirt, which Sierra wore the day she disappeared and was found later with the rest of her clothes, in the same load of her familys laundry, to which she said yes. Lopez also asked Pugh whether she, Sierra and their other friends would have shared jeans in addition to T-shirts, sweatshirts and sweaters, to which she answered no. Sierras jeans were among the items found in her backpack. When Lopez asked Pugh whether Sierra ever talked about going to house parties, she struggled to remember until shown a police report logging an interview with a detective. However, the defense attorney was forced to withdraw a question about whether Sierra had planned to take drugs at a party. The subject of drug use is one of the topics considered off-limits in the trial. The trial is set to resume on Monday morning. By Bay City News Photo via Shutterstock",0

868,"This story originally appeared on Patch in April of 2016. A Tredyffrin Township woman who has been arrested for kidnapping a newborn Thursday at the King of Prussia Mall told authorities she recently had a baby who passed away and in an out of body experience, took the strangers child because I just wanted my baby. According to a criminal complaint provided by Upper Merion Police, 32-year-old Cherie Amoore told investigators she had a baby in February that lived just a few hours. When she held 7-week-old Ahsir Simmons, the feelings rushed back. Police have not confirmed the story provided by Amoore is accurate. Amoore is facing felony kidnapping charges after taking the infant baby boy from the mall mall food court around 5:30 p.m. Thursday, police said. The search for the baby boy prompted an Amber Alert and a statewide search for hours on Thursday. The baby was found unharmed at her home at 10:18 p.m. He was sleeping in a car seat owned by Amoore.When investigators went to Amoores home on Thursday night, she answered the door and said I took the baby and I am sorry, according to the criminal complaint. She told investigators she did not go to the mall with the intent to steal a baby. According to information from the District Attorneys office, the alleged kidnapping happened after Amoore struck up a conversation with the babys mother at the mall and followed them to the food court. When the mother was helping her older son, Amoore walked away with the infant, leaving through a door near the Bonefish Grill restaurant, police said. Contrary to initial information, the babys mother never consented to allowing Amoore to hold her infant, the complaint said. Investigators said Amoore took the baby to her house, changed its clothing from the outfit he was wearing at the mall and put his original clothes in her car, where they were located by police. In an interview with 6ABC Thursday night after being reunited with her baby, the infants mother said I would like to thank God for allowing my baby to come back. And, I want to thank the Upper Merion Police Department, and everybody on social media that helped me get my baby back. I want to thank you so much. Amoore is facing the following charges: kidnapping a minor; unlawful restraint; false imprisonment; interference with the custody of a child; concealment in the whereabouts of a child and other related charges, the DA said. Her bail was set at $500,000 and she is currently lodged in Montgomery County Prison. The charges follow a joint investigation by Upper Merion Police Department, Montgomery County detectives and the FBI. 6ABC confirmed that Amoore is the daughter of Republican Party of Pennsylvania Deputy Chairman Renee Amoore, who is also a panelist on the networks show, Inside Story.

869,"Sheriffs officials today appealed for public help in their search for three very dangerous detainees who escaped from the Central Mens Jail in Santa Ana roughly 16 hours before they discovered missing. The men cut through a steel grate, half-inch steel bars and plumbing tunnels early Friday before making their way to an unsecured part of the jails roof and using makeshift ropes to rappel several floors to the ground. A reward of $20,000 has been offered by the FBI, and $30,000 has been offered by the U.S. Marshals Service for information leading to the capture of the suspects, Orange County sheriffs Lt. Jeff Hallock said at a mid-morning news conference. The three inmates were charged today with felony escape. One or two of the suspects are believed to be involved with Vietnamese gangs, and they may be embedded with the Vietnamese community in the area, sheriffs investigators said. We think that theres obviously ties, based on the fact that one of the individuals is a documented Vietnamese gang member, Hallock said. We think its a strong possibility that he may have connected with those fellow gang members in the Vietnamese community. Authorities restated their warning that the suspects should be considered armed and dangerous -- and potentially desperate. Were over 48 hours that we know this escape occurred, Hallock said. Yeah, they could be very desperate. We dont have any information to indicate that they are together. But time would tell you they get to a point where they become desperate, whether they need money or somebody to help facilitate their well-being on a day-to-day basis. But obviously the concern is that they are desperate. They are facing some very serious charges. Thats why were pleading for the publics help because we know somebody out there knows something. Authorities were tight-lipped on the details of their search, but said around 30 warrants had been served since the escape was discovered. The jail was operating normally today, while an investigation continued into how the inmates managed to pull off such an elaborate escape -- cutting their way through four or five metal barriers to access plumbing tunnels and make their way onto the roof of the jail. On Sunday, Sheriff Sandra Hutchens told reporters on that the suspects had some tools. Where they got those tools and how they got them, we do not know that, Hutchens said. Hallock said the men, who were awaiting trial on charges ranging from murder to attempted murder to torture, are believed to have escaped shortly after a 5 a.m. physical body count, one of two that take place each day at the facility. They werent found to be missing until about 9 p.m. Friday, during the second daily headcount, which was to have started at 8 p.m. but was delayed by an altercation possibly staged to help delay discovery of the escape, Hallock said. Jail guards do five counts throughout the day in Mod F, but only two of them are physical body counts, Hallock said. The other three are a comparison of computer records with a mod card, which is essentially a jail ID card that lists a detainees charges and other information, Hallock said. When an inmate is sent to court or elsewhere outside the jail the card stays in possession of a guard, Hallock said. Hossein Nayeri, 37, of Newport Beach, was in custody on kidnapping and torture charges for the abduction of a marijuana clinic owner who Nayeri allegedly drove to the desert and burned with a blowtorch. The victim was also sexually mutilated, prosecutors said. Nayeri fled the United States to Iran. Authorities do not have extradition agreements with Iran, where Nayeri has family, so investigators used a ruse to get him to the Czech Republic, which is more cooperative with the U.S. for extraditing fugitives, according to Senior Deputy District Attorney Matt Murphy. Nayeri was arrested in Prague while changing flights from Iran to Spain to visit family, Murphy said. Jonathan Tieu, 20, of Fountain Valley, faces murder and attempted murder charges in connection with a gang hit, prosecutors said, and Bac Duong, 43, of Santa Ana, faces an attempted murder charge and was being held without bail on an immigration hold pending a possible federal deportation hearing. Tieus mother and sister went on ABC7 to beg him to surrender to authorities. Please just turn yourself in, said sister Tiffany Tieu. Dont let this drag on. The relatives said he did not kill anyone and that they believed he did not take part in planning the escape. I feel he was manipulated or tricked into during this, Tieu said. A mistrial was declared in March of last year when jurors deadlocked on charges against Tieu, according to court records. At least two of the escapees had spent enough time at the jail to engineer a sophisticated escape, Hallock said, describing the breakout as well thought out and possibly the result of weeks or even months of planning. Authorities were continuing to investigate whether other inmates had a hand in the escape, most notably through the altercation that occurred in the jail and delayed the usual 8 p.m. body count. There was a disturbance among the inmates ... where a deputy was assaulted, Hallock said. At this point we preliminarily believe it may have been planned as to divert attention of staff toward that disturbance so it would delay that 8 p.m. body count, which it did for a short time. Steps have been taken since the escape to harden the facility against any more breakouts, Hallock said. The sheriffs department released photos and a video that show, among other things, a cut quarter-inch steel grate inside the dormitory-style tank of about 60 inmates from which the inmates escaped, one of several makeshift ropes -- this one found inside the tank after the escape -- and whats believed to be at least one of the suspects on the jail roof in the pre- dawn darkness. After reaching the ground, the suspects fled on foot, investigators believe. The jail complex -- which dates to 1968 and lacks some in-house services that are features of more secure modern jails and prisons -- consists of three facilities housing about 900 inmates. The body count today is about 960 in the Central Mens Jail, with a maximum capacity of about 1,200, Hallock said. That tank in Mod F is a maximum security jail that has inmates with similar, very serious charges, Hallock said. Attorney Michael Molfetta, who represents Nayeris co-defendant, Ryan Kevorkian, blasted sheriffs officials, saying they should have had a more watchful eye on Nayeri. If anyone is to be red-flagged, a lets-keep-an-eye-out-for-this-guy, its Nayeri, Molfetta said. I dont understand how the Nayeris go relatively unsupervised in jail, never mind foster such a plan, but to get such a big jump -- it doesnt make sense to me. Hallock said it wasnt immediately clear why Nayeri was housed in the manner he was because officials have not had time for an internal review of the escape, since they are more focused on apprehending the escapees. Conducting numerous head counts during the day is not possible because detainees are in and out of the jail for various reasons, including court appearances and medical checks and treatment, Hutchens said. The entire complex is maximum security. There have been two prior escapes from the jail, most recently in 1989. The sheriffs and probation departments, Orange County District Attorneys Office, U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI are involved in the search, which Hallock called a 24-7 operation until these three individuals are caught. Anyone who sees any of the suspects should call 911 immediately, and anyone with information regarding their possible whereabouts was urged to call a special hotline at (714) 628-7085.

870,"SOUTH AUSTIN, TX: A woman reportedly threatened a mother at knifepoint and attempted to kidnap a 1-year-old baby in South Austin Monday morning. The victim reported she was carrying her infant to her vehicle on Deer Run Drive on Dec. 7 at 8:13 a.m when she saw what she believed to be a red Chevrolet truck with four doors stop near her residence, police said.

871,"Two Boston men were indicted by a Statewide Grand Jury on Thursday on charges of human trafficking for sexual servitude, kidnapping and deriving support from prostitution. Marquis Campbell, 22, of Hyde Park, and Steven Diaz, 32, of Boston, were indicted on those charges. Campbell was also charged with two counts of rape, according to Attorney General Martha Coakleys office. Campbell allegedly raped the victim after she was kidnapped and recruited into prostitution. We allege that these defendants kidnapped a woman, transported her to multiple hotels and outcalls, coerced her to engage in commercial sex, and kept all of the profits from these encounters, said Coakley. We thank Massachusetts State Police and the Essex District Attorneys Office for their assistance in this case. Campbell and Diaz were arrested during a traffic stop in Danvers in May 2014. The victim, who was in the backseat, asked the State Police trooper for help. The two men allegedly kidnapped the woman days before the arrest and coerced her into prostitution over a three-day period. She reportedly provided sexual services for a fee in hotels in several Massachusetts communities, including Danvers, said the AGs office. The AGs office said: The men allegedly took photos of the woman and subsequently used them to post advertisements offering sexual services on websites known to advertise prostitution. Authorities allege that they transported the victim to hotels and to outcalls, coerced her to engage in sexual acts with multiple men, monitored the money being earned, and ultimately collected all of the proceeds. The two men will be arraigned in Essex Superior Court at a later date.",1
872,"Police are asking for the publics help in identifying a man who approached students at bus stops and offered them rides in unincorporated Des Plaines Wednesday. Around 7:30 a.m., a man on a bicycle rode up to a boy and a girl at a school bus stop near Church Street and Bay Colony Drive and offered them rides, Cook County Sheriffs police said. The bicyclist told the boy he could give him a ride in his car if the school bus did not show up, according to a news release from Sheriff Thomas Dart. He then rode over to a girl at the same bus stop and offered her a ride, asking her to go for coffee with him. Both kids ignored the man and got on the bus. Detectives learned the man had gone to another bus stop and made similar statements to students waiting there, according to the release. The bike rider was described as a 5-foot, 10-inches to 6-foot, blond-haired white man between 30-40 years old. He was wearing a black hooded coat, black jeans and a black hat.

873,"For Sgt. Denise Nestor, prevention is a family affair. Not just for her, but for all families. Nestor, a mother and Pinellas County Sheriffs sergeant, offered plenty of preventative tips to parents and children during at Dunedins 12th annual Touch-a-Truck on April 27. While honks and toots from nearly 100 trucks and cars echoed across Highlander Park, she stressed the importance of constant dialogue between parents and young children in order to combat potential child predators Saturday during two Pinellas County Sheriffs seminars geared at families. To help, Nestor brought along her husband, also a law enforcement officer, and 12-year-old son. Nestor said her son is able to relate to the children on a kid-to-kid level, which actually helps them retain the information better than if she were to explain it. He took the mic toward the end of the presentation and spoke on using a code phrase to signal when they feel threatened, unsafe or creeped out. Here are four of many tips Nestor shared with her audiences Saturday: 1. Have a plan. Before entering into any event or store, Nestor advised parents to get into the habit of designating a meeting place should they become separated from their child. She also said make sure your child can repeat back to you what youre wearing, your cell phone number, and who to turn to for help (i.e., a uniformed police officer, a store employee). 2. Use your voice. Teach your children to use phrases like no or get away from me if someone tries to touch them or asks them to do something that doesnt seem right. 3. Have a code word or phrase. Nestor says its when, not if, your child will find him or herself in a precarious situation. Whether its being lured by a sexual predator or facing peer pressure to consume drugs or alcohol, Nestor says its statistically going to come from someone they know and trust. Having a code word or phrase in place allows your child the opportunity to call you for help without tipping off a would-be offender. 4. Carry up-to-date photos. Nestor suggests carrying a flash drive key chain with your childs latest photo saved on it. This saves time in the precious early minutes of a possible abduction because youll already have something to give to authorities on the scene so the search can start immediately across jurisdictions via an Amber Alert, if necessary.

874,"Two officers who helped save a woman allegedly kidnapped and raped by a man posing as an Uber driver were cleared of any wrongdoing Tuesday by the Los Angeles Police Commission after one of the officers shot at the suspect. The 5-0 vote by the commission agreed with Chief Charlie Becks assertion that the officers use of force was within department policy. The incident occurred on April 3, 2016 in the Westlake district after a woman was allegedly approached by the suspect, Dartanyun Lamar Smith, as she was waiting for an Uber and he convinced her he was from the ride-sharing service. However, the woman became alarmed and called 911 from the backseat of the SUV after she realized Smith was not taking her to her destination and became scared and knew something was going to happen, according to Becks report on the incident. After Smith began sodomizing, beating and sexually assaulting her in the back seat, other witnesses also called 911, the report said. Two officers responded to the call. One of them, Officer Jhoel DeJesus, has previously been identified by the LAPD as the one who shot at Smith, but the other officer has not been identified. After locating the SUV in the 300 block of Ingraham Street, the officers witnessed Smith assaulting the victim and one of them shattered the rear drivers side window with a baton, according to Becks report. Smith then ignored the officers commands, jumped in the front seat, started the SUV and aimed it at DeJesus, according to Becks report. DeJesus then fired one shot at Smith, but missed him. The officers got into their squad car to try to chase Smith, but were unable to find his car. They did however locate the victim a few blocks away as she had managed to escape. Smith was later arrested and charged with one felony count each of forcible rape, sodomy, kidnapping to commit rape and assault on a peace officer. City News Service",1
875,"A Stoughton man is one of four who face federal charges in a 2016 kidnapping case in Quincy. On March 22, Sedrick Oliveira of Stoughton, Diego Pires of Brockton, Malik Bangura of Taunton, and Yesenia Diax of Brockton, were indicted on kidnapping charges involving an adult and two minors in Quincy. An affidavit obtained by the Enterprise says the victim was pulling up to his Marina Bay home with his two children when he was pulled from his vehicle by two masked men and played into a car with Sedrick Oliveira of Stoughton. Authorities say Oliveira, Pires, Malik Bangura of Taunton, and Yesenia Diax of Brockton drove the victim to Brockton and made him call his drug associates and girlfriend to get between $50,000-$100,000 in exchange for the safe return of him and his two kids. Failure to do so would result in the victims death, Oliveira said. In the victims car, the suspects pulled out marijuana and stacks of cash before leaving the SUV in an alley with the two kids in it.

876,"He led Coasta Mesa police on a wild, dangerous chase across Orange County in 2012 and on Thursday, he was convicted for his actions that night, but there are more charges pending for his actions that led up to the pursuit. Juan Manuel Reyes, now 36-years-old, is suspected of kidnapping his then-pregnant ex-girlfriend, who gave birth to their son during her 11 days of alleged captivity. While that charge is pending, he was convicted Thursday of leading Costa Mesa police on a wild chase in which he rammed two patrol cars, triggering an officer-involved shooting. Reyes was convicted of two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, both felonies, and one count each of felony evading and misdemeanor hit and run. Reyes is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 19. Reyes trial on the kidnapping charges is pending, so jurors in the current trial only heard evidence about the police pursuit in Costa Mesa. A Costa Mesa officer on the lookout for Reyes, who had earlier eluded Santa Ana police in a pursuit, spotted him just before 5 p.m. on Sept. 11, 2012, at 3028 Coolidge Ave. The officer, who was in an unmarked car but was in uniform, saw Reyes driving the girlfriends car and tried to get him to pull over, but he hit the gas, triggering the pursuit, Deputy District Attorney Caroline Smith said in her opening statement. With officers in two separate cars in pursuit, Reyes sped down Baker Street until he hit red-light traffic and turned into a Mobil gas station, Smith said. One officer tried to block the driveway, but Reyes veered around him and then collided with the other officers car, the prosecutor said. Reyes did a 180 turn and then slammed into the other officers car, she said. When one officer got out of his car with his gun drawn and approached the suspect, he accelerated at the lawman, Smith said. The other officer saw Reyes make a fist pump motion through the defendants tinted window and, believing the suspect may be armed, fired three shots, striking the vehicle only, she said. Did that stop the defendant? No, Smith said. A woman who was pumping gas at the station witnessed everything but the shooting, which she heard, the prosecutor said. She thought the officers safety was jeopardized, Smith said. The pursuit continued through the city at speeds up to 80 mph, Smith said. At one point, when he became caught up in rush-hour congestion, Reyes squeezed his vehicle through traffic, sideswiping one womans car and breaking glass that injured her arm, Smith said. Reyes also drove into oncoming traffic at Main Street and Red Hill Avenue and collided with one of the pursuing police cars, Smith said. The officer got out of his vehicle with his gun drawn, so Reyes backed up and continued to evade, Smith said. The chase continued to Sunflower Avenue, where the car Reyes was driving broke down, Smith said, urging jurors to hold him accountable for two separate assaults... when he used that car as a deadly weapon. Defense attorney Renee Garcia, in her opening statement, said, Yes, he may be guilty of some crimes, but this case is over-filed. She said her client fled when one of the officers opened fire. He was scared for his life, she said. Surveillance video of the officer-involved shooting is missing, Garcia said. We dont have video of the shooting, she said. Thats because they need to justify this. The officer who opened fire on Reyes was disciplined, according to Garcia. Reyes tried to avoid the officer in the second collision, but he was rammed by the officer, which is against the police departments policy, Garcia said. Reyes faces a separate trial on the alleged kidnapping of his ex- girlfriend on Aug. 30, 2012. He is accused of holding her in various motels in Orange County for 11 days, threatening to kill her family if she told anyone, according to Deputy District Attorney Cyril Yu, who filed those charges. During her alleged captivity, the victim gave birth to the couples son, according to Yu, who said Reyes took her to a hospital when she went into labor. The woman managed to get away from him on Sept. 9, 2012, two days before the police chase, according to Santa Ana police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna.

877,"Manalapan, NJ - A Fort Lee woman who falsely claimed she was kidnapped in Manalapan last summer has been indicted this week by a Monmouth County grand jury. Marian Petro, 46, called 911 at 6:35 a.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 19, 2015. She said she was pulled over in her car and forced into the back seat of another car near the intersection of Route 33 and Sweetmans Lane in Manalapan. She claimed she was held at gunpoint and put into the backseat of a black Mercedes Benz by a black male with dreadlocks. Manalapan police officers responded but were unable to find the woman, the car or any witnesses to the incident. That led to a massive police search in and around Howell Township for the next several days, where police from several towns, as well as county, state and federal law enforcement agencies responded in an effort to find her. Finally, Petro was located Tuesday in a hotel in Willow Grove, Pa., where she was staying with extended family, a spokesman for the Monmouth County Prosecutors Office said at the time. She was unharmed. If convicted of creating a false public alarm, Petro faces a sentence of three to five years in prison. It still remains unclear why she called 911 with the made-up story.",1
878,"A man already charged in the 1975 murders of two young girls was indicted Monday on rape charges in a 1996 incident, according to Prince William County Circuit Court filings. Lloyd Lee Welch Jr., 59, was indicted on felony counts of rape, object penetration, aggravated sexual assault and indecent liberties. He already is scheduled to go on trial in April for the murders of sisters Shelia Lyon (12) and Katherine Lyon (10), who were kidnapped from a Wheaton (Md.) mall more than 40 years ago. The new indictment could become a factor in that trial. Prince William County commonwealths attorney Paul Ebert told WTOP the rape of the 7-year-old girl, now 27, happened in May 1996 in Woodbridge while Welch was visiting the victims mother. He declined to say whether the victim participated in the investigation. In the Lyons sisters case, prosecutors in Montgomery County charged Lloyd Lee Michael Welch Jr., who is locked up in a Delaware prison, with the first-degree felony murder of the girls. He is the nephew of Richard Welch Sr., who has been named a person of interest in the case, and has consistently denied any wrongdoing. Lloyd Welch was scheduled to go on trial for the sisters murders on Oct. 18 in Bedford County (Va.) but a new trial date of April 2017 was set so his attorneys can wade through hours of interviews the suspect gave with police. Montgomery County authorities believe the girls were taken to Taylors Mountain in the rural Virginia county – where relatives of the Welches live and own land – and their bodies burned and hidden. In February 2015, investigators said they believed the girls were taken by the convicted sex offender and later sexually assaulted by his uncle, Richard Welch, according to court documents.

879,"An inmate convicted in the 1992 murder of a north Georgia doctor is scheduled to to be executed Tuesday evening. J.W. Ledford, Jr., is set to be executed by lethal injection at 7 p.m. at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson. He would become the first inmate executed in Georgia this year and 70th since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Ledford, 45, arrives at his execution day after an unusual legal appeal. Ledfords attorneys had petition the courts to let him be killed by firing squad, arguing that the lethal drug cocktail used in Georgia for executions is inhumane. Lawyers argued that because Ledford has been taking a drug to treat nerve pain for years, the pentobarbital intended to act as a sedative may not work as intended. State experts testified that the amount of the drug used is more than sufficient to cause death without pain and a federal appeals court denied Ledford a stay of execution. According to court records, Ledford, who was then 20, had been drinking and using drugs when he murdered his neighbor, 73-year-old Dr. Harry Johnson in Murray County. Ledford stabbed Johnson to death shortly after the elder man had given him a ride in his pickup truck. Ledford also tied up Johnsons wife, Antoinette, and stole firearms from the familys home, saying he needed money for drugs. He sold a rifle and shotgun at two different pawn shops and was arrested shortly thereafter. On Monday, the state Board of Pardons and Paroles denied Ledfords request for clemency in the case. kidnapping. The United States Supreme Court denied Ledfords request to appeal last month. Ledfords execution would be the first in Georgia since William Sallie was executed in December. Georgia executed nine death row inmates in 2016, nearly doubling its record for executions. Five inmates had been executed in 2015. There have been 68 men and one woman executed in Georgia since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty. If executed, Ledford will be the 47th inmate put to death by lethal injection. There are presently 57 men under death sentence in Georgia. For his last meal, Ledford didnt skimp. He requested Filet Mignon wrapped in bacon with Pepper Jack cheese, large french fries, 10 chicken tenders with sauce, a fried pork chop, a bloomin onion, pecan pie with vanilla ice cream, sherbet and Sprite.

881,"Glendora Police detectives say a local businessman has become a victim of a new trend of computer malware scams. Police received a report from a resident claiming that he received an email from what he thought was from his bank. But when he clicked on the zip file attachment, a malware virus encrypted his files, rendering them useless, according to a police statement. Two windows then appeared, one with the title Crypto Locker, demanding that he pay $300 via a pre-paid money card and he will receive a key to unlock his files. If he did not pay the money, he would no longer be able to retrieve his computer documents and other files. According to a police investigation, the origin of the email and the account asking for the ransom came from overseas. Police say there is no guarantee that the files would be retrieved once the ransom is paid. These types of sophisticated crimes are becoming more prevalent and it is my hope that by informing the public we can reduce the chances of our community members falling victim to these types of cyber-crimes being perpetrated from across the world, said Chief of Police Rob Castro in a statement. Glendora Police offered these tips for computer users to avoid becoming victims of this latest computer scam. 1.     Dont click on anything unless you know what it is and who it is from.  In the case of Crypto Locker, it disguises itself as a legitimate source such as the US Postal Service, your local bank, etc.  If you are not expecting anything from these sources, dont open the email. 2.     If you get an email from anyone with an attachment, do not open it unless you trust the sender. 3.     Dont click on links that seem too good to be true, such as How to Make Money or How to Speed up your Computer, etc. 4.     Dont trust cold calls. Do not give your information to anyone who calls you.  If they say that they are from tech support and have found a virus on your computer, it could be a scam.  If you give them access, they will control your computer remotely and use your personal information to open new charge accounts or charge on your existing accounts.  If the caller claims there is a security threat to your computer, hang up and call your computer company directly.",0

885,"Amber Alerts, the emergency response system that disseminates information about a missing child, have helped police safely recover 262 missing Michigan children. Hopefully, with a little tweaking of the system, theyll be able to help even more kids. Effective, Jan. 1, Amber Alerts will only be issued for cases of child abductions involving victims under the age of 18, but all Amber Alerts will receive a Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA). A vehicle license plate number is no longer required for a WEA. Previously, in addition to abducted children, Amber Alerts were authorized for missing children with severe mental or physical disabilities who wandered away and were unable to care for themselves. Any time a child goes missing, its an urgent situation and we should all pay attention; however, in the case of child abductions the urgency is even greater, said Col. Kriste Kibbey Etue, director of the MSP. By tightening the standards for issuing an Amber Alert we will ensure these alerts are utilized in only the most dire of circumstances to get credible, useful information out to the public in order to bring abducted children home safely. Missing child cases that dont meet the revised Amber Alert criteria will be eligible for a new notification called an Endangered Missing Advisory, for which there is no age restriction. The Endangered Missing Advisory is a notice sent to broadcast and print media in the geographic area of the incident, but unlike an Amber Alert, this advisory does not utilize the Emergency Alert System to interrupt broadcasting and it will not be sent to mobile devices as a WEA. Michigans AMBER Alert is a partnership among the MSP, Michigan Association of Broadcasters, Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police, Michigan Sheriffs Association and Michigan Department of Transportation.

The description of the suspect, his vehicle and the incident itself is similar to an episode from the night of Sept. 18, near Willard Middle School. In that incident, two Willard Middle School students were walking on Telegraph Avenue, near Stuart Street, when a van pulled up next to them and a suspect told them to get inside, according to police. Like in Sundays incident, the students refused and later reported it to authorities. Police said Sundays victims exercised excellent personal safety habits. Officers will work with the Berkeley Unified School District and other schools to recommend personal safety measures and share information about the incidents, according to the Police Department. Berkeley police will also be providing extra patrols around the citys schools. Police are asking for the publics assistance in finding the suspect. Any sighting of the suspect or his vehicle should be reported to (510) 981-5900, police said. In late September, Alameda Police investigated a report of a suspicious green van spotted driving slowly in the area near Ruby Bridges Elementary School on the same day and about twenty minutes before— Berkeley Police received reports of two attempted abductions by a man driving a dark green van.

890,"It looks like the family of Elisa Nelson will get the closure theyve been seeking since the 10-year-old Palm Harbor girl went missing and was later found dead back in 1980. Her convicted killer, Larry Eugene Mann of Dunedin, has run out of appeals, The Tampa Tribune is reporting. While Manns attorneys had requested a review of the case the court has decided against hearing any of the appeals filed by Capital Collateral Regional Counsel, The Tribune says. That means Manns scheduled execution on April 10 at 6 p.m. can move forward. Mann, 59, was convicted in 1981 of first-degree murder and kidnapping in connection with Nelsons death. The Palm Harbor Middle school student vanished Nov. 4, 1980, on her way to school. She was late for school because of a dentist appointment and was carrying a tardy note from her mother. Police and community members started searching for Nelson after her bike was found in a ditch a mile away from Palm Harbor Middle School on the same day that she disappeared. Her body was found in a Palm Harbor orange grove the following day. Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed the death warrant for Mann in March. He is scheduled to die by lethal injection. While Manns execution wont bring Elisa back, her aunt Wanda Vekasi is relieved its moving forward. It will bring closure, I dont care what people say, Vekasi, a Tarpon Springs resident, told The Tribune.  But for my tax dollars to keep that guy alive all these years is ridiculous.

894,"Theres one detail at the heart of an attempted kidnapping in Cedar Rapids, Dubuque, and an incident in Marion: a white van. Police reports have described it as a 90s Chevy Astro Van, an Astro Van, and, in two cases, a white van. The problem is, theres apparently 314 white Chevy Astro vans manufactured between 1992 and 1997 registered in Linn County. Police in and Cedar Rapids say that residents have placed about the attempted kidnapping and sightings of white vans, but so far none of these calls have lead to suspects. Cedar Rapids Police said theres now increased scrutiny of white work vans, which, unfortunately for the investigation, are a popular make, model and color of work vans (my father owns one for his business). A Cedar Rapids resident reflected this same sentiment to the Gazette. Now everyone is looking at every guy driving a white van, thinking he could do something. Everybodys a suspect. This week, the FBI released surveillance photos, taken of a white van in Evansdale the day two cousins were abducted there. That lead turned out to have no connection to the case, authorities said.

895,"Prosecutors began their work on the Steven Dean Gordon trial Wednesday in a case where Gordon is defending himself in the murder of four prostitutes in Orange County. Both Gordon and his co-defendant Franc Cano face the death penalty in a case that prosecutors are playing out as more murder-mystery than the opening of a trial. A prosecutor Wednesday described how two men wearing GPS monitors raped and murdered four prostitutes in Orange County, describing how detectives gathered evidence that he said proves a registered sex offender wearing a GPS monitor was able to rape and murder 21-year-old Jarrae Nykkole Estepp, 20-year-old Kianna Jackson, 34-year-old Josephine Vargas and 28- year-old Martha Anaya. The trial of 47-year-old Steven Dean Gordon is unusual on multiple levels. Earlier this year, Gordon won the right to defend himself in his death penalty trial. On Tuesday, he agreed to a stipulation about the facts of the case in exchange for prosecutors dropping rape charges against him -- but as opening statements were about to begin, he reversed himself and said he didnt want the deal. Gordon then declined to give an opening statement. The six-man, six-woman jury will hear evidence, possibly through December, first determining if Gordon is guilty of killing the four women. If he is convicted, jurors will consider whether to recommend death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. Co-defendant Franc Cano, a 30-year-old Anaheim resident, also faces the death penalty and was also wearing a GPS monitor at the time of the killings, will be tried separately. The only victims body to be recovered was Estepps, which led to multiple clues tying Gordon and Cano to the other killings, Senior Deputy District Attorney Larry Yellin said. Investigators recovered Estepps remains March 14, 2014, at an Anaheim recycling facility. Prior to that discovery, Santa Ana detectives were stumped about the other three missing women, Yellin said. Jackson was the first to be reported missing -- on Oct. 6, 2013 -- when her mother could not reach her anymore on the phone, Yellin said. Next to be reported missing was Vargas on Oct. 24, 2013, Yellin said. Her family reported her missing, he said. They put up fliers -- again, nothing -- no bank activity, no credit card activity. Anaya went missing Nov. 12, 2013. When the body of Estepp -- who left Oklahoma for Orange County, where she had relatives -- was found in the recycling facility, initially it was thought to be a mannequin, Yellin said. Once investigators realized they had a murder on their hands, they had trouble identifying the victim, but Estepps tattoos helped them solve that riddle, Yellin said. A discarded caulking tube under the victims body offered detectives their first important clue, Yellin said. Investigators tracked it to Boss Body and Paint, 3421 E. La Palma Ave., where Gordon parked his RV and sometimes worked odd jobs, according to the prosecutor. A tampon found on Estepp, meanwhile, contained DNA that turned out to match Cano and Gordon, Yellin said. Detectives managed to calculate the time the body was dumped at the facility, and investigators checked the time against the movements of the defendants, who were both on GPS monitoring due to their previous convictions. Since Estepp appeared to have been raped, Detective Julissa Trapp sifted through computer records containing the movements of registered sex offenders, leading her to Cano, whose GPS device indicated he was near the area where Estepps body was dumped, Yellin said. At that point Seven Gordon was not even on law enforcements radar, Yellin said, noting that Gordon was under federal GPS monitoring and Cano was wearing a state GPS monitor. Trapp called Santa Ana police, who provided phone records on their missing person cases, Yellin said. And when they compared the GPS-recorded movements of Cano and the other three victims, investigators saw a pattern, Yellin said.Another detective realized that Cano and Gordon often hung out together. Investigators asked Cano to come in for questioning and collected his DNA for the first time from a water bottle he drank from, Yellin said. Other investigators followed Gordon and picked up a wad of discarded gum to get his DNA, Yellin said. He noted that neither mans DNA was previously in the legal database, despite their earlier convictions on sex crimes. The prosecutor also showed jurors text-message exchanges between the two defendants that were often lewd and offensive as they discussed picking up prostitutes and spoke in their own code about killing them, according to the prosecutor. The two would refer to the women as cats or kitty, Yellin said. When Gordon protested the killing of Estepp because she made me (orgasm) three times, Cano urged him in a text message to get your hands dirty, according to Yellin. Gordon reminded Cano, Youre forgetting what Im wearing tonight, apparently referring to his ankle bracelet. Cano suggested happy hands to Gordon on the method of killing, Yellin said. Estepps cause of death was strangulation. According to Yellin, Gordon initially told detectives he just wanted to have sex with the victims, but things got out of hand and the killings were crimes of passion. After asking to talk to Cano and being told -- falsely -- that his friend did not want to speak with him, Gordon changed his story and said the two worked together to pick up the prostitutes and kill them, Yellin said. The two defendants appeared to know how to avoid raising red flags with the GPS devices. Cano was convicted in 2008 of lewd and lascivious acts on a child younger than 14, and Gordon was previously convicted for lewd and lascivious acts on a child younger than 14 in 1992 and kidnapping his estranged wife in 2002. The defendants pleaded guilty in 2013 to failing to register as sex offenders in Nevada and were sentenced to time served in custody, according to federal court documents. They both then had their cases sent back to Orange County. They cut off their GPS devices before going to Las Vegas, officials said. They were put on lifetime supervised release and again tracked with GPS monitors. Photo, Orange County Sheriffs Dept. Franc Cano (left) and Steven Dean Gordon.

899,"Williamson County Sheriff Robert Chody on Thursday posted a video on his official Twitter account purporting to show a girl running away from an attempted kidnapping he reported as having happened earlier in the week. Chody said the surveillance camera footage shows the 8-year-old girl running near OConnor Drive and Pocono Drive at around 7 p.m. on Tuesday. Chody earlier issued an alert about the incident, describing the alleged suspect as a man with muscular build and a lightning bolt shape shaved onto the side of his scalp. The video doesnt show the suspect, but shows a young girl running across the screen in the background. The child managed to resist and pull away from the mans grasp after he grabbed the girls arm, Chody previously explained. The incident is said to have happened near the Avery Ranch subdivision, Chody said, near a series of mailboxes in a neighborhood between Cedar Park and Round Rock. In addition to the lightning bolt design on the mans head, the suspect is said be between five feet, ten inches tall to six feet tall. He was said to have been wearing a red T-shirt, blue jeans and black shoes and sported a black stud earring and tattoo of unspecified design on his right bicep, the sheriff said in his previous advisory. After the unsuccessful kidnapping attempt, Chody said the man drove off in what may have been a black Honda CRV with a dent of between three to five inches on the front passenger side of the vehicle. A black-and-orange basketball decal was affixed to the lower corner of the back window, and there was some kind of fuzzy, round decoration hanging from the rear view mirror, according to Chody. On a Facebook neighborhood page called People of NW Austin and Cedar Park, a woman named Jamie Olson-Lott posted a news story about the near-abduction, claiming the child in the video is her daughter. She asked fellow residents in the area to watch any home surveillance camera footage they might have to see if any further footage exists. Ok guys, the woman begins her post.

902,"The prime suspect in the kidnapping and sexual assault of a 10-year-old Northridge girl was arrested Wednesday in Mexico. Tobias Dustin Summers, 32, was arrested by Mexican police working with the Los Angeles Police Department and FBI, according to Lourdes Arocho of the FBI. Following up on a tip late Tuesday night, police in Mexico found Summers at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center south of Tijuana. Alfredo Arenas, commander of the Baja California state police fugitive squad, told the Los Angeles Times that Summers was surprised and frightened by the large contingent of officers who showed up at the center to arrest him. LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said a $25,000 reward that was highly publicized south of the border led to a telephone tip about Summers whereabouts. He had embedded himself in the community in various ways, Beck said. Tim Delaney, special agent in charge of the criminal division of the FBIs Los Angeles field office, told reporters at a noon news conference at City Hall that Summers had been brought across the border and was now in police custody in Los Angeles. Beck hailed the cooperative effort with the FBI, Mexican authorities and San Diego Police Department that led to Summers capture. He also said he hoped the arrest sends a message. We could never make whole the lives of that family and the young girl after this horrific event, but we can and we will and we do make plain to anybody in this city that thinks that they can commit that kind of crime and remain free after doing so, we can make sure that they know that that is not true, Beck said. Well hunt you. Well find you. You cannot hide. Summers was charged earlier this month with 37 felonies stemming from the March 27 abduction of the girl from her bedroom in the 8000 block of Oakdale Avenue. The girls mother discovered the girl missing around 3 a.m. when she went to check on her after hearing a commotion in the house. Police said the girl was taken to various locations in two vehicles and was sexually assaulted before being dropped off near a Woodland Hills-area hospital that afternoon. She was comforted by a good Samaritan at a nearby coffee shop until police could be summoned. The girl was barefoot and appeared to be wearing different clothes than those she was reported to be wearing when she disappeared. Councilman Mitchell Englander, who represents Northridge, said he was angry at this criminal, this animal who ... invaded this girls purity. Englander said he was thankful the suspect is behind bars and hopefully will never, ever see the light of day again. Police said Summers has a lengthy rap sheet dating back to 2002, and was released from prison or jail last July, as a result of the states effort to relieve prison overcrowding. He has served prison terms for robbery, kidnapping, explosives possession and petty theft, police said. Englander declined to comment on Summers early release from prison in a previous case. Although he is not known to be a registered sex offender, Summers did have an arrest for battery in 2009 that involved child annoyance, Smith said. On March 31, police arrested Summers alleged accomplice, 29-year-old Daniel Martinez, who has been charged with one count each of kidnapping and first-degree burglary. Summers, however, remained at large. LAPD Chief Charlie Beck announced April 5 that Summers had been seen on surveillance tape crossing a foot bridge into Mexico. Summers has been charged with one count each of kidnapping a victim under 14, kidnapping to commit another crime and first-degree burglary with a person present, along with 34 sex-related counts. He faces multiple life prison terms if convicted, according to the District Attorneys Office. The criminal complaint alleges that Summers has prior convictions for grand theft and petty theft dating back to December 2003. Beck said Summers will be held in Los Angeles on $19 million bail. - City News Service",1

Detectives from the Washington State Patrol Missing and Exploited Childrens Task Force (MECTF) have made an arrest involving allegations of Child Pornography, Sexual Exploitation of a Minor, and Extortion. MCTEF detectives initiated the investigation in late April after being alerted by a concerned parent of one of the girls involved. The investigation positively identified eight underage victims all in the Pierce County area. Detectives learned Monday morning that the suspect had returned from an overseas deployment. David Michael Ford, 24, of Macon, Georgia and currently stationed at Joint Base Lewis McCord (JBLM) was taken into custody this afternoon and booked into the Pierce County Jail on charges of (1) Possession of Depictions of a Minor Engaged in Sexually Explicit Conduct, (2) Communication With A Minor for Immoral Purposes, (3) Sexual Exploitation of a Minor, and (4) Extortion. The investigation involved interviewing dozens of victims and witnesses. The allegations involved female victims ranging in ages from 15 to 17 years old.  While most the allegations involved online activities, the investigation revealed there were two instances where Ford met in person with his victims.  The investigation revealed Ford would use money, gifts, and ultimately fear tactics to extort illegal images and video from his victims. Evidence obtained from Fords computer showed dozens of images of other potential victims that have yet to be identified.  The WSP continues to encourage anyone believing they may have been victims of Ford to contact MECTF detectives at 360-704-2400.

909,"Like some other municipalities, the city of Lilburn employs the use of license plate readers to capture the bad guys. Bad guys include those who are driving around in stolen cars, people wanted for previous crimes, those who have abducted babies, and more. In August, for example, the city used the special devices to alert them to a stolen car, which led them to eventually find a suspect hiding in the freezer of an Ingles grocery store. -- Do you think the use of these license plate readers is justified, even if the plates of law-abiding citizens are also capture? Let us know in the comment section below. -- Typically, three automatic license plate readers (ALPRs) are mounted to patrol cars, and cansnap pictures of thousands of plates each day. Police are then able to quickly check the the plates numbers against policy agency databases. There is an alarm when a match is found, and the police officers computer displays who the car is registered to and if the car is suspected in a crime, among other things. The city of Lilburn has one, and the police department has used it for several years. Gwinnett County Police Department, which patrols unincorporated Lilburn, using them, as well. But, while police departments are busily capturing the plates of could-be bady guys, they are also collecting information on anyone else who happens to drive by or be parked in the vicinity of the plate readers. Like other police departments, Capt. Ben Haynes agrees that Lilburn Police Department sees the readers as a benefit -- one that outweighs public angst. However, the ACLU worries that this could be a violation of privacy for law-abiding citizens. In July, the organization sent 587 requests to local police departments across the nation, including some in Georgia. When used in a narrow and carefully regulated way, ALPRs can help police recover stolen cars and arrest people with outstanding warrants,  the ACLU said on its website. Still, the ACLU added that police departments nationwide are using ALPR to quietly accumulate millions of plate records, storing them in backend databases. While we dont know the full extent of this problem, we know that responsible deletion of data is the exception, not the norm. So, what do you think Lilburn, is the automatic license plate reader used in the local police department an invasion of your privacy? Do you think the law enforcement tool is well worth it if criminal can be swooped off the streets? Let us know in the comment section. See some of our other Speak Out stories, and comment on them, as well:",0

An information officer for the department told Patch that detectives were reaching out to other law enforcement agencies to see whether the suspects description and method of operation matched other abduction attempts in the region.

The 47-year-old, former Shelby Township resident pleaded not guilty last month in 41-A District Court to the charge, which carries with it a maximum five-year jail sentence. Britteny Wrobel, 25 said that she called police on Aug. 3 after Varghese took her one-year-old son Xach from her arms.

Mario Deandre Jackson, 28, and Leon Scott, 25, were indicted on robbery, kidnapping and firearms crimes after police tracked a Crime Stoppers tip to Memphis and discovered evidence allegedly linking the men to the May 25 incident. According to prosecutors, police discovered a wedding band allegedly stolen from the Buckhead home at a Memphis pawn shop with a tag linking the item to Scott. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported at the time of Scotts arrest that his cell phone was linked to one used by another person to call the victims home at 2 a.m. the morning after the robbery, though the victim was unable to understand what the person on the other end had said.

929,"Every 40 seconds, the time it takes to heat up a slice of pizza in the microwave, a child is reported missing somewhere in America. Some are runaways, but others are abducted. Most have come home alive, due in part to efforts like those taking place on Friday, May 25. National Missing Childrens Day has been recognized annually on May 25 since 1983 to raise awareness about those who are missing and recognize efforts to reunite children and their families. The actual number of kids who are reported missing every year is hard to calculate, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which was established in 1984 to coordinate search efforts. Some children are never reported missing and others, like repeat runaways, are entered in the FBI National Crime Information Center each time they run away. Since its founding nearly 35 years ago, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has assisted in the recovery of more than 260,000 children. But some have never been found.

The nonprofit National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was established by parents like John and Revé Walsh, whose 6-year-old son, Adam, was abducted from a Florida shopping mall in 1981 and later found murdered. Before the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children existed, police could enter information about stolen cars, guns and other items on the FBIs crime database, but not stolen children. The Adam Walsh disappearance was among several tragic cases that illuminated the need for a nationwide, coordinated system to address the problem of missing children. Others included Etan Patz, a 6-year-old who vanished from a New York street on the way to school in 1979. Over the next several years, 29 children and young adults reported as missing were found murdered in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1982, West Des Moines, Iowa, paperboy Johnny Gosch, 12, never came home from his paper route. His disappearance remains unsolved. Former President Ronald Reagan was an honored guest when the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children opened its doors in 1984. A year earlier, he had proclaimed every May 25 as National Missing Childrens Day. Since then, the Department of Justice has annually commemorated National Missing Childrens Day with a ceremony honoring heroic and exemplary efforts of agencies, organizations and individuals to protect children, and to coordinate efforts to reunite missing children with their families. The problem of missing children is particularly acute in California, which accounts for nearly half of the missing children cases documented on the Polly Klaas Foundation website. The states with the most missing children reports since 1994 are as follows: California: 4,541Texas: 489Florida: 364Arizona: 246New York: 223Washington: 218Ohio: 209Colorado: 183Illinois: 177Georgia: 171Oregon: 153Pennsylvania: 153Nevada: 150Michigan: 130Indiana: 124 Stock photo by Lightspring/Shutterstock.

930,"A police detective said God sent him to arrest a tattoo-faced man who was plotting to kidnap a baby and rape the child before killing it. On Monday morning, a Will County judge cleared the way to set the scheming pervert free. The tattoo-faced man, 28-year-old Andrew Castro of Crest Hill, was sentenced to three years probation for possessing child pornography. Prosecutor John Connor had asked Judge Sarah Jones to take into account Castros plan to kidnap, rape and kill a baby, and to also murder the childs mother, but the judge had already said that was irrelevant when it came to her decision on the deviants sentence. The state has urged me to consider as a fact in aggravation crimes that have not already been committed, Jones said Monday. I cannot do so. Castro and his brother, Levi Castro, 30, were arrested in December 2014 after the cops raided the Theodore Street home where they lived with their parents and found child pornography. Levi Castro pleaded guilty in April 2015. He also got off with probation. During a police interrogation following the arrest of the Castro brothers, Investigator Rich Wistocki told Andrew he was frightened by the talk of kidnapping, raping and murder. It just scares the hell out of me that you and your brother were driving down the street and saying, Hey maybe we can get that, Ive seen a little girl, Wistocki said. Wistocki then invoked divine intervention when he broke down how the two brothers never actually got around to kidnapping or raping any babies. That scares me. But at the same time, I think God sent us to your house so that doesnt happen, Wistocki said. While Andrew Castro was sentenced to probation on Monday, he was sent back to jail while his attorney, Timothy Specht, looks for a place where he can live. Levi Castro has already returned home to reside with his parents, and Andrew cannot join him due to prohibitions on sex offenders living together. Andrew Castro was to appear in court court again next week. On top of possessing child pornography and scheming to rape a kidnapped baby, Andrew Castro also had eyes for one of the familys pet dogs, Connor said at a previous court hearing. Andrew Castros feelings for the dog developed after he had his first sexual experience at the age of 12, Connor said. Animal control took the Castros dogs away after police raided the house, Wistocki said during Andrews interrogation.",1
931,"- Prosecutors in Iredell County dropped a 2015 Lake Norman sexual assault case Tuesday after they say the officer had not provided a statement from the victim, according to the Charlotte Observer. The charges stem from a Sept. 4, 2015 incident that ended with two men accused of attempting to sexually assault 22 -year-old woman on a sailboat. Sheriff Darren Campbell, however, defended his office to the newspaper, saying officers always obtain victim statements before bringing charges. Following the 2015 incident, Campbell told the Observer that deputies arrested and charged Robert Michael Weidinger and his brother-in-law John Richard Drigalla after an officer responded to sounds of a woman screaming on a boat near Yacht Cove Lane in Mooresville. The men later told the deputy that they had dropped off a woman they had met earlier that night at a bar at a dock at the Trump National Golf Club Charlotte. The Sept. 4, 2015 incident allegedly occurred on a sailboat on Lake Norman near the Trump National Golf Club, according to original Iredell County Sheriffs Department reports/ Photo via Google maps The woman was later found by officers at a Charlotte hospital seeking treatment for injuries she told them occurred while on the boat. The two men were arrested and charged with first-degree kidnapping, attempted first-degree rape assault on a female and interfering with emergency communications, the newspaper reported.

933,"BEDFORD-STUYVESANT — A man shot himself in the head after barricading himself into a Bed-Stuy apartment for hours Wednesday, police said. The situation began after the gunman shot another 28-year-old man, thought to be his landlord, twice around 2 p.m., the NYPD said. He then locked himself into a fourth floor apartment at 565 Gates Avenue as specially trained police hostage negotiators tried to talk to him for nearly two hours, the NYPD said. A spokesman said they were unable to make contact and made the decision to go into the apartment at 4:10 p.m. Police said they found the man with a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head and two firearms underneath his body in the apartments bedroom. He was taken to Kings Hospital, where the 28-year-old had been taken earlier. The condition of neither man was known Wednesday afternoon. It is unknown if anybody else was involved.

934,"- Police released a sketch Thursday of a man suspected to trying to kidnap a teen girl as she was walking on a Concord street last month. The attempted kidnapping happened on July 6 at about 2:45 p.m. on Laguna Street near Ellis Street, police said. The girl, 16, was walking alone when a man in a car drove by, turned around and then parked. The driver then got out and approached her. As he spoke to her, he grabbed her arm and then tried to forcefully pull her towards his car. The victim, however, fought back by kicking and punching the suspect, causing him to eventually let her go, according to police. As the girl ran away, the man drove off, heading toward Detroit Avenue. The girl immediately told her parents and they called police. The man was described as a Hispanic man, between 35 and 40 years old, 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighing 160 pounds. He had an unshaven appearance and wore glasses along with a blue hat and buttoned up collard shirt. His vehicle was described as a four-door gold or beige American made sedan, similar to a 2000 Buick LeSabre, police said.

935,"Hickory Hills police on Thursday released additional details of an attempted carjacking and aggravated kidnapping that took place Tuesday evening and have local women on edge. The incidents occurred minutes apart around 9:45 p.m., in the 9700 block of Roberts Road. In the first incident, a suspect described as a black male of small build, believed to be 16 to 18 years of age, wearing a dark, hooded sweatshirt, approached a female who was in her car. The suspect flashed a black handgun at the victim and ordered her to unlock the car. She refused and was able to drive away from the area. She reported the crime to police as she left. The man then approached a second woman sitting in her car at the same location. He got into the unlocked car, showed her the gun and ordered her to drive away. She had driven a short distance when he told her to pull into a parking lot of a closed business. He ordered her to get into the backseat, but the woman fought back and the offender fled, police said. Hickory Hills Police units responded to the area but were unable to find the attacker. Officers recovered the weapon used in the incidents — an Airsoft pistol, a toy gun that uses compressed air or gas to fire plastic or foam pellets. The Hickory Hills Police Department, along with the Southwest Major Crimes Task Force and several local law enforcement agencies, continue to investigate. These incidents are believed to be related to the similar incident that occurred in Palos Hills on Sept. 9. In that attack, the suspect accosted a woman near her car and forced her at gunpoint to drive to another place, where he then sexually assaulted her, police said. The attacker is described as a black male, 5-foot-6, between 16 and 18 years old and 120 pounds. He was wearing a gray hoodie and blue jeans. Palos Hills police are now offering a $1,000 reward for any information on the suspect. Suspect sketch provided by Palos Hills Police Department",1
936,"Conspiracy and false imprisonment charges were dismissed this morning against two men who were accused of guarding and helping to keep a woman captive while their employer allegedly sexually assaulted her for nearly three months on his ranch west of Santa Rosa. Deputy District Attorney Chris Honigsberg said prosecutors determined they could not prove the charges against the defendants beyond a reasonable doubt. Sonoma County Superior Court Judge Gary Medvigy then dismissed the charges. Guillermo Cresteno Avina, 34, of Santa Rosa, and Jaime Gomez Cisneros, 52, of Watsonville, we to be released from Sonoma County jail today, Honigsberg said. Both men were scheduled for a preliminary hearing this morning. Previous: A preliminary hearing for the alleged assailant, Jose Angel Barajas-Mireles, 34, of Santa Rosa, began today as scheduled. He is charged with two counts each of rape, sodomy and oral copulation that involved torture, great bodily injury and a deadly weapon, and conspiracy and false imprisonment. Barajas-Mireles attorney Andrew Martinez said his client and the 22-year-old woman had a romantic relationship that included consensual sex. The alleged victim was the bookkeeper for Barajas-Mireles painting and renovation business, Martinez said. The alleged victim told Sonoma County sheriffs deputies she escaped on Feb. 18 through an unlocked door on the ranch. After the charges were dismissed, Cisneros attorney Walter Rubenstein and Avinas attorney Kristine Burk said the alleged victim changed her story and has no credibility. How many times has this happened to people who are facing 30 years in prison because of something someone said? Rubenstein said. Burk said the prosecutions motion to dismiss the charges against Avina and Cisneros is based on a third interview the prosecution had last week with the alleged victim. This is a case that fell under its own weight. We just got to witness it, Burk said. These guys are innocent. Theyre not criminally responsible for anything related to the complaining witness. They were workers and did painting and odd jobs for room and board, Burk said. First she said they were involved in kidnapping her and holding her hostage. In a supplemental interview she never explained what their true role was. It was constantly changing, Burk said. Honigsberg said he informed Burk and Rubenstein on Friday that he was going to dismiss the case against their clients today. From the start, this was an ongoing investigation, Honigsberg said. On Feb. 18, the alleged victim went to the Petaluma Police Department to report she was kidnapped at gunpoint three weeks earlier and held against her will on property in unincorporated Santa Rosa, where she said she was beaten and sexually abused, sheriffs officials said. A week later, sheriffs officials said the woman was not kidnapped at gunpoint but had initially said so out of an overwhelming sense of fear of retaliation coupled with the traumatic events she endured. Sheriffs officials said the woman had injuries consistent with her statement and detectives determined she was kidnapped in the Roseland area of southwest Santa Rosa. The three defendants were arrested Feb. 25 when they went to the sheriffs office to retrieve property that was taken during a search at the Stony Point Road ranch on Feb. 19. All three were being held in the county jail under $6 million bail. --Bay City News --Shutterstock image Also on Patch: » Find your Patch below, click on the link and sign up for our free daily newsletters and news alerts: | CAPITOLA-SOQUEL| SANTA CRUZ| SCOTTS VALLEY| WATSONVILLE|",1
937,"The names of the victim and suspect in Saturday nights shooting death of a taxi driver in Chamblee have been released.

938,"Editors note: The identity of the woman interviewed for this story is being withheld for her safety. The woman stood alone at about 8:30 a.m. on Nov. 23, 1977, at a Port Authority Transit stop in Wilkinsburg, waiting for the bus that would take her to her job in downtown Pittsburgh. The 24-year-old had grown up in Wilkinsburg, and she and her husband had purchased a property on nearby Rebecca Avenue, which they were remodeling. The bus stop was close by on Ardmore Boulevard. As she waited in the chilly November air, a motorist pulled his car off the street, partially into an alley and onto the paved area of an auto repair garage—right next to her. To the best of my recollection, the woman said, during an interview last week, ... he made a suggestion I did not appreciate. Something about the man instinctually heightened the womans sense of danger. When she threatened to call the police, he made a U-turn on Ardmore Boulevard and headed back toward the Parkway East. In 1977, there werent personal cell phones—so carrying out her threat would have required making her way quickly to a nearby business, home or Johnston Elementary School, which was across the street. She did not report the incident to police after he left. But what the woman did do was to write down the red-and-white Ohio license plate number and note that he was driving a blue car. I didnt think about it anymore, she said. -------- About 2:15 p.m. that same day, Beth Lynn Barr, 6, left Johnston Elementary School on Franklin Avenue, which dismissed an hour early because of the holiday. She crossed the street with classmates and began the two-fifths of a mile walk alone to her Princeton Boulevard home, heading up Ardmore Boulevard in the direction of the WTAE-TV studios—past the bus stop where the man had approached the woman hours before. Beth turned left onto Marlboro Avenue, then immediately right onto Traymore Avenue. There, according to a witness, a man carried a schoolgirl fitting Beths description into a dull blue sedan with red-and-white license plates. That was the last time anyone saw her. Beths father, Charles, was a Wilkinsburg policeman. The police force sprang into action when she didnt come home from school. ------- That evening, Wilkinsburg police knocked on the womans Rebecca Avenue door as they canvassed the neighborhoods around the school. She shared the information about the man who had approached her that morning. Her description of the man and car pretty much matched that of the witness who saw Beth being carried to the car. Police described the suspect as a white male in his 40s, 5-feet-10 to 5-foot-11, medium build with medium brown, curly hair. He was wearing a gray suit and square, blue-tinted sunglasses. He would have reminded me of someone with an office job, the woman said, adding that he was possibly wearing a necktie. She also remembers he was not an attractive person. She was surprised that the police didnt contact her again about the encounter as the investigation continued. I never heard anymore about it, the woman said, noting it was more than a year later when they talked to her again. ------- Police thought they had found the car involved at Conleys Motor Inn (now the site of a Home Depot) on Business Route 22 in Wilkins Township. The vehicle belonged to a car rental agency based in the motel and, according to records, had not been signed out on the days surrounding the kidnapping. A search of the blue car with red-and-white Ohio plates turned up nothing. Police from , Wilkins and other local departments helped Wilkinsburg officers comb the woods behind Conleys, which yielded no clues. Neither did a search of the homes and woods in Wilkinsburg. On Dec. 10, 1977, there seemed to be a break in the case. Police arrested a McCandless Township salesman in connection with the kidnapping, but charges were dropped when he established an alibi that he had been in Johnstown that day. Both the salesman and his brother agreed to submit to lie detector tests. Lt. Robert Thomas, then officer in charge of the Wilkinsburg Police Department, said in 1979 that he was not positive that they ever took the tests or, if so, what the results showed. A psychic had been called in soon after the kidnapping, and some seven to nine others offered visions of Beths whereabouts, including water and grave markers. In March 1979, Joseph Leonard of Monroeville stumbled upon a partially exposed skeleton as he walked with his dog in the woods off Johnston Road in Monroeville, across from the part of Restland Memorial Cemetery where the duck pond is located. There was no doubt it was Beth. Though brush, dirt and leaves covered her skeleton, Beth remained dressed in the red pantsuit, blue tennis shoes and plaid coat she wore to school that November day. Thomas delivered the sad news to Donna and Charlie Barr, and their son James, at their Princeton Boulevard home exactly 16 months to the day, within the same hour that their daughter disappeared. The mounded grave appeared more piled than shoveled, former Monroeville police Det. Willis Greenaway said at the time. He noted, according to the crime lab, bodies sometimes surface following freeze-thaw conditions. An autopsy revealed Beth had been stabbed several times in the chest, according to then-Assistant Chief Deputy Coroner Anthony Pankowski. He said the condition of the skeleton was consistent with Beth being dead since the time of her disappearance. Pankowski also said that there was no way to determine if she had been sexually molested, though the lab was to run tests on her clothing. Some newspapers reported that the area adjacent to Restland Cemetery had been searched after Beths disappearance, but police officials at the time—Thomas; Harry Hodgins, who had been Wilkinsburgs chief in 1977; and former Monroeville Chief George Gregowich—concurred the area had never been searched. ------ The woman said police tracked her down at work and interviewed her a second time, which she recalls was around the time Beths body was found. I said to them, What ever happened? They explained about tracing the car back to the rental agency, which is about three miles driving distance from where Beth was eventually found. When the woman asked about the car, they told her the rental agency manager said it had never left the premises. I found that absolutely astounding, the woman said. Obviously, they found the car. But the investigation never went anywhere. Frankly, that was the last I ever heard from them. ----- Through the years, the woman has occasionally thought about the little girl who never made it home. Not long ago, she and an old friend talked about how they remembered going to see Walkin Rosie, a ghost said to haunt Restland Memorial Cemetery in Monroeville. The friend recalled that Beths body had been found adjacent to the cemetery —and that her killer had never been found. That same friend mentioned a cold case story about Beths murder that appeared in Gateway Star Newspapers in 2003. The woman looked it up online and found herself mentioned as the woman at the bus stop. But as she read further, something bothered her. The story noted that the day Beth was abducted, three newspapers in the former Dardanell Publications weekly chain—the Penn Hills Progress, Churchill Area Progress and Wilkinsburg Gazette—all carried a story about the one-year anniversary of the strangulation murder of Barbara Lewis of Penn Hills, whose body was found in a trash bin in the Blackridge Civic Association parking lot in Churchill. Lewis belongings had been found in a wooded area off Princeton Boulevard in Wilkinsburg, the street where Beth lived. And then came the sentence that hit a little too close to home for the woman—the one that said that Lewis, too, had been waiting at a bus stop on Long Road in Penn Hills on the morning she was murdered on Nov. 19, 1976. There were just too many coincidences, the woman said. Theres got to be a connection. In fact, there has been some speculation that Lewis murder was the last in a string of what is believed to be serial murders in western Pennsylvania between 1976 and 1977. And just a few weeks before Beth disappeared, two boys walking in the woods at Bradys Run Park found the skeletal remains of Stephanie Ann Boller of Beaver Falls, an apparent homicide victim—and there were some similarities between the cases. Some police believe that Beths abductor was likely a pedophile and that there might not have been a connection to the incident at the bus stop earlier in the day. In retrospect, the woman feels very fortunate that she was standing on the passenger side of the car that day, 34 years ago. She doesnt want to think what might have happened if shed been on the drivers side. That could have made a world of difference, the woman said. ----- Looking back, the woman thinks Wilkinsburg police botched the case by holding on to it so long before turning it over to Allegheny County police detectives and not accepting help from more experienced Pittsburgh police detectives. She isnt alone. A man, who identified himself as the son of a former Turtle Creek policeman, also contacted the author of this story after seeing an account of Beths murder. According to him, his father was at Kellers Hardware Store in Turtle Creek around the time of the kidnapping when a man walked in and bought a shovel and a few other items that raised the policemans suspicions. The son said his father called Wilkinsburg police with information, but that no one ever checked out the lead. Had the man who kidnapped Beth continued along Ardmore Boulevard, it is not out of the question that he might have been in Turtle Creek, taking the back roads to Monroeville. Attempts to reach county homicide detectives have not been successful, but Patch will update the story should any additional information become available. ----- Eight months after Beth was laid to rest at Woodlawn Cemetery in Wilkinsburg, the woman and her husband relocated to a distant city. I always wonder why I moved away from Wilkinsburg, she said. She might have answered that question several years ago when the city where she had lived for more than 20 years started to feel not so safe. Thats when the woman and her family moved again. Its a shame, the woman said, referring to the fact that Beths killer has never been found. I still dont believe its a lost cause. Someones going to come forward. Anyone with information about the murder of Beth Lynn Barr is asked to call the Allegheny County Police Homicide Division at 412-473-1300.

Judge Mark Levitt said the case was the worst he has seen in his legal career during a sentencing hearing for Jose Reyes, 31, on Wednesday, the Lake County News-Sun reports. Reyes was convicted during a trial last year of aggravated kidnapping, predatory criminal sexual assault and possession and production of child pornography. The depths of your depravity are unmatchable, Levitt said during Wednesdays hearing. Reyes first went to the Mundelein apartment complex and offered lollipops to the 3-year-old girl and her 9-year-old sister but the girls refused the candy, according to the Daily Herald. He drove away but returned. The younger girl was taken from the entrance of 555 Deepwoods Drive in Mundelein around 5:30 p.m. on Sept. 30, police said. Reyes took the girl to a different location where he filmed the sexual assault on his phone. That video was played during his bench trial, according to Lake County News-Sun. Levitt said during the hearing Wednesday that video contained things that cannot be unseen and sounds that cannot be unheard, according to the Daily Herald. Reyes must serve 85 percent of his total sentence before he becomes eligible for parole. More via the Lake County News-Sun and Daily Herald",1

Authorities say a female hostage, who was reportedly shot in the torso, was rescued and taken by helicopter to a nearby hospital. The suspect, identified as 29-year-old Andrew Mike of Downey, was fatally shot during an officer-involved shooting, according to officials with the Redlands Police Department.

945,"The Gwinnett Police officer who fatally shot the Suwanee hostage-taker during the April 10 standoff also was involved in another high profile incident. Sgt. Jason Teague has been released from the hospital after suffering a gunshot wound to his left forearm and undergoing surgery. The wound came in a gunfire exchange with Lauren Brown, who held five Gwinnett firefighters hostage for several hours after a 911 call that was a hoax. Teague was allowed to come home April 13. Doctors think he will make a full recovery and should be able to return to duty in a few months, according to a news release issued by the Gwinnett Police Department. Teague also was involved in the 2005 Brian Nichols slaying saga that began in a courthouse in Atlanta, according to the news release. Nichols, who was on trial for rape, beat a courthouse deputy, grabbed her gun, and then shot to death a judge, a court reporter and another deputy before fleeing, according to reports. Nichols later shot to death a federal agent in Buckhead before his flight brought him to Gwinnett County. In Gwinnett, Teague actually placed the handcuffs on Nichols and later testified at his trial for the slayings. Nichols had barricaded himself in an apartment in Duluth.

947,"Tyrone Lewis, convicted of first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting of Alexandria community activist Lenny Harris, was sentenced in Prince Georges County, Md., court Friday to life in prison without parole, plus 120 years, according to The Washington Post. Through tearful testimony, Harris widow asked the judge to give Lewis the maximum sentence. I have lost my husband of 19 years, my best friend, the father of my daughter, my hero, my confidant, Deborah Harris said, according to The Post. Harris expanded on her familys suffering after her husbands death, saying she lost the family home in Del Ray and that her daughter dropped out of college because of the grief. She also revealed that she lost a son to gun violence 17 years ago. Lenny Harris, 53, went missing in Alexandria in Sept. 21, 2011. After a months-long search, his body was found in a Fort Washington, Md., well on Jan. 26, 2012. During court proceedings in September, prosecutors said Lewis and two other men mistakenly thought Harris was a wealthy man. According to testimony, the three men kidnapped Harris and later shot him in the back of the head as he begged for his life. Lewis co-defendant, Linwood Johnson, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, robbery with a deadly weapon and related charges. Johnson and the cases third defendant, Ivan Johnson, have not been sentenced. Both accepted plea deals. Johnson testified that Lewis decided to rob Harris because he needed bail money for a friend, according to The Post. Johnson said that Harris, who had his own pest-control business and a T-shirt company named Mycha after his daughter, was able to produce only $50 when he was abducted. Frustrated with the way things played out, Lewis directed the group to an abandoned house and shot Harris in the back of the head, Johnson testified. A graduate of T.C. Williams High School and one-time business owner on Mount Vernon Avenue, Harris was active in local politics and community issues. He founded the nonprofit Operation H.O.P.E. that presented the annual One Love Community Festival. Each year, Harris outfitted in-need kids at the festival with new backpacks and classroom supplies. In October, Alexandria City Council approved the naming of a park in honor of Lenny Harris. Lewis, 28, was on probation for robbery when Harris was killed. He has since been charged in killings from 2005 and one from a few weeks after Harris death. Lewis denied any involvement in the killing Friday and plans to appeal the conviction, according to The Post. Its a surreal situation, Lewis said.

950,"A former Chicago cop currently serving a life sentence for a conviction in a kidnapping plot admitted having a role in the death of a Highland Park restaurant owner five years ago, according to a new report. On Sept. 25, 2012, Giacomo Ruggirello was found dead from smoke inhalation after firefighters extinguished a ferocious fire at his home in the 1700 block of Midland Avenue. Earlier that day, the Italian restaurant owned by the Sicilian-born 61-year-old, Trattoria Giacomo in Highwood, had its safe stolen in what authorities described as a sophisticated burglary. Several sources now tell the Chicago Tribune that the FBI made undercover recordings of a notorious former Chicago cop and Buffalo Grove resident in which he discusses responsibility for the deadly blaze. The imprisoned ex-cop Steven Mandell, previously known as Steven Manning, has been implicated but never convicted in a series of other murders. Do you think they respect my work now? Mandell asked, according to FBI informant George Michaels account of the covert recording. Two other sources confirmed to the Tribune that Mandell was taped discussing the fire. In 2014, Mandell was convicted of a conspiracy to kidnap, rob and possibly murder a wealthy Riverside businessman. He is currently serving a sentence of life in prison. His associate and fellow former cop Gary Engel later hung himself in prison. After getting kicked out of the Chicago Police Department following allegations he ran an insurance fraud racket, Mandell began working as an informant with the FBI in the 1980s. But the feds stopped working with him after one of the targets of their investigations was found dead, the Tribune reported. In 1993, Mandell was convicted in the drug-related 1990 murder of a trucking company owner. However, a judge overturned it on appeal, and in 2005 a federal jury awarded him $6.5 million in damages. (A judge later threw out the entire award, according to the Tribune.) The Tribune reports the FBI also recorded him plotting to kill a different businessman in order to take control of his Bridgeview strip club. Mandells name was first linked to the investigation into the death of the Sicilian-board Ruggirello when his defense attorneys attempted to subpoena records from the Highland Park Police probe of the deadly fire in 2013. The Tribune reports the case file and discussions between the judge and attorneys about the issue remain sealed more than four years later. Ruggirellos death remains a mystery. Police say there is an ongoing criminal probe into his death, which has not been classified as a homicide. Five years is too long to wait for answers, Ruggirellos daughter told the Tribune. Neither the FBI or Highland Park police have commented on the new report.

952,"A 17-year-old boy has been arrested in the rape of a Herndon woman March 28 and two armed robberies at a barbershop in the same area near Manassas Park, Prince William Count Police said Wednesday afternoon. The name of the Manassas teen is being withheld because of his age, but he is charged with rape, abduction with intent to defile, robbery, using a firearm in commission of a felony and grand larceny. A search warrant was executed at his home where he was taken into custody by Northern Virginia Gang Task Force members and county police, accroding to PWCPD spokesman Jonathan Perok. A 31-year-old Herndon woman told investigators she was walking along Maplewood Avenue on Thursday night when a man pointed a gun at her, dragged her into a secluded area behind a Vermont Place townhome and rapped her. He also made off with the victims cell phone and cash, investigators said. Detectives with the Prince William County Police Special Victims Unit and the Robbery Unit identified the suspect and linked him to the rape as well as two robberies at the Maplewood Barbershop. according to Perok. One of the robberies was the same day that the rape was reported. Police responded to the first robbery around noon on March 1 after receiving an initial report of two suspicious persons. Employees of a business near the barbershop reported to E-911 dispatch that two unknown, masked men were outside acting suspiciously. It was later determined that a robbery had taken place, police said. Barbershop employees reported that the same two men entered the business where one of the men displayed a handgun and demanded money, but became impatient while waiting on the money and took an employees cell phone instead.

The man then ordered everyone to leave the store before being confronted by an employee at the back of the business. The employees screamed causing the suspect to run away. No injuries were reported and no money was taken. The suspect is being held at a juvenile facility. No court date is available.",1
953,"It looks like the family of Elisa Nelson will get the closure theyve been seeking since the 10-year-old Palm Harbor girl went missing and was later found dead back in 1980. Her convicted killer, Larry Eugene Mann of Dunedin, has run out of appeals, The Tampa Tribune is reporting. While Manns attorneys had requested a review of the case the court has decided against hearing any of the appeals filed by Capital Collateral Regional Counsel, The Tribune says. That means Manns scheduled execution on April 10 at 6 p.m. can move forward. Mann, 59, was convicted in 1981 of first-degree murder and kidnapping in connection with Nelsons death. The Palm Harbor Middle school student vanished Nov. 4, 1980, on her way to school. She was late for school because of a dentist appointment and was carrying a tardy note from her mother. Police and community members started searching for Nelson after her bike was found in a ditch a mile away from Palm Harbor Middle School on the same day that she disappeared. Her body was found in a Palm Harbor orange grove the following day. Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed the death warrant for Mann in March. He is scheduled to die by lethal injection. While Manns execution wont bring Elisa back, her aunt Wanda Vekasi is relieved its moving forward. It will bring closure, I dont care what people say, Vekasi, a Tarpon Springs resident, told The Tribune.  But for my tax dollars to keep that guy alive all these years is ridiculous.

Hackbarth reached forward and put his arm around the females neck and threatened to kill her, then choked her repeatedly, police reports said. The two men bragged that they were gang members belonging to the 211-Crew, and the couple noticed one man had a tattoo of Johnny Cash on his hand and the other was wearing a hat that said Zoo York. The woman jumped out of the moving car at Wadsworth and Chatfield, as it traveled around 50 miles per hour, police said. Hackbarth and Cleveland then ordered the male to turn into a neighborhood and pull over. They threatened to shoot him and told him to get out of the car. Hackbarth and Cleveland then drove away in the female victims car. The woman climbed over a backyard fence, pounded on a door and screamed for help, the affidavit said. Police found the man walking along Wadsworth holding her shoes. Sheriffs officers located Hackbarth and Cleveland nearby after neighbors complained that they were making a disturbance. Cleveland was later discovered to have a Johnny Cash tattoo on his hand and Hackbarth was wearing a Zoo York hat matching the description provided by the carjacking victims. The jury found Hackbarth guilty of kidnapping, aggravated robbery, second degree assault and aggravated motor vehicle theft and other counts. Cleveland is scheduled for sentencing on Sep. 20 and Hackbarth is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 6, the district attorneys office said.

965,"- Not long after he was released from a New Hampshire prison in December, Brian Chevalier posted a profile on Zoosk, an online dating site. Chevalier, 51, of Merrimack, N.H., didnt post many details, only to say he had attended college, he was Christian, he did not smoke, he was 5 foot 7 inches, and had an average build. Shortly after he joined Zoosk, he began exchanging messages with 49-year-old Wendi Davidson of North Andover. The two met and hit it off. By Valentines Day Chevalier had proposed to her. You were the missing piece to my heart!! Davidson posted on Facebook when she announced the engagement on social media. When a friend commented on the post that Davidson and Chevalier move fast, she wrote When you both know, then you know! Do you know? another friend asked in the comments of the post. I know!! Davidson wrote. Now Chevalier sits in a California jail, awaiting extradition back to Massachusetts to face charges he strangled Davidson last weekend, hid her body in the basement of her North Andover home, then fled to California. The crime he is accused of has gruesome parallels to the details from a December 2003 incident in which Chevalier tortured and threatened to kill an ex-girlfriend. Chevalier was convicted of kidnapping in 2004 and served 14 years of a 33-year sentence before being paroled last year. She knew about his past, one of Davidsons close friends told Patch. Im just not sure how much she knew. At some point between their Feb. 14 engagement and earlier this month, Davidson started to have second thoughts. She told another friend that he was controlling and prone to angry outbursts. She did a deeper search into his past and learned all the lurid details of the crime he had been convicted of. In late March or early April, the friend said, Davidson tried to cool things off with Chevalier and called off the engagement. Chevalier changed his relationship status to single on Facebook, but Davidson kept her relationship status listed as engaged on Facebook. The two continued to swap public messages on the social network, but many of Davidsons posts seemed more despondent than the messages she had posted earlier in the year. She posted memes about overcoming challenges in life, some of which Chevalier commented on. I think she kept herself listed as engaged because she was afraid of how hed react, the friend said. Like it would mean he had no chance of getting back together with her. Its impossible to read too deeply into any social media post, and a meme declaring the sentiment tomorrow is a new day can just as easily be about a flat tire or a bad day at work as it can be about a bad break up. A lot of what Davidson shared with her friends is typical Facebook fodder: she shared viral videos, pictures from a relatives birthday party and Amber alerts for missing children. She joked about the winter that never seemed to end and posted videos of dogs. She had two sons and posted a message that would be familiar to any parent who has proudly shared a childs college decision on Facebook. Chevalier opened his Facebook account around the time the couple got engaged. Most of his activity was posting comments on Davidsons posts. He clicked that he liked the Bruins, Patriots and Red Sox. He also liked Motley Crue and Flock of Seagulls. He noted that he graduated from West High School in Manchester, N.H. in 1984. On April 9 he posted that he was looking for an apartment, preferably in southern New Hampshire. Shortly after the couple was engaged, one of Chevaliers aunts posted a congratulatory message saying that she and another aunt hoped to meet his fiance. Thank you Auntie Estelle, you have always had my back no matter what. Im new to this Facebook thing so I dont really pay much attention to it so sorry for the long delay in my reply, he wrote in response. Tell Auntie Pauline that I said thank you. I would love for you both to meet her someday. Shes wonderful and amazing and not like the others. Tell everyone I said hello and send my love. Chilling Similarities On Tuesday, Patch reported on Chevaliers 2004 conviction that led to his nearly 14-year prison stint. In that case, Chevalier hid in the Jaffrey, N.H., house of a woman he had briefly dated and attacked her when she got home from work. He beat her and sexually assaulted her and threatened to kill her. He tied her to a bed with duct tape. He choked her to the point where she passed out. At trial and in a later appeal, Chevalier unsuccessfully tried to argue the woman had an interest in sexual bondage and that the sex was consensual. At one point he told his then 33-year-old victim he was going to kill her and hide her body in a freezer in her basement. At another point he tried to get the woman to buy an airplane ticket to California, telling her he planned to flee there after he killed her. After 21 hours, Chevalier forced the woman to drive him back to his car and begged her to not call the police. At the time of the December 2003 attack, he was on parole after having served prison time for burglary. Investigators have released few details about Davidsons murder, but have said that she appears to have been strangled. Her body was found by a neighbor in the basement at 50 Lincoln Street. The neighbor alerted Davidsons brother. The brother, who also lives in the house, called police at 12:28 pm last Saturday. Chevalier was arrested Friday in California. A hearing is scheduled for Monday in an Imperial County, CA, court at which time investigators expect to learn whether Chevalier will waive extradition back to Massachusetts to face murder charges. Davidsons last publicly viewable post on her Facebook page was made just after noon on April 19, just 48 hours before her lifeless body was discovered. The post contained the results of an online personality quiz that sought to find the respondents greatest inner strength. The quiz told Davidson that her greatest inner strength was compassion. She posted the results without comment. You have a true sense of empathy for all you meet, and your willingness to reach out and help those in need will ensure that youll make an abundance of friends in your lifetime, the quiz results said. You have an amazing talent for continuing to give to others past the point where most would falter. Never miss another local news story: Get free local news alerts right to your inbox.

972,"DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN, BROOKLYN — Three men were indicted Wednesday in connection with the 2014 kidnapping and murder of Menachem Stark, a Hasidic Williamsburg landlord and father of eight, the Brooklyn District Attorneys office said. Erskin Felix, 38, of Crown Heights was indicted for murder and kidnapping, while his brother, 28-year-old Kendall Felix and his cousin, 35-year-old Irvine Henry, also from Crown Heights, were indicted for conspiracy, the Brooklyn DA said. Erskin and Kendel Felix, who are cousins, accosted Stark on the street as he left his office at 331 Rutledge St. in Williamsburg on Jan. 2, 2014 at around 11:30 p.m., according to the Brooklyn DA. Stark tried to escape but was unsuccessful, and the Felix cousins forced him into a van and drove away from Starks office. Kendall and Henry Felix, also cousins of Erskin and Kendel, then met up with Erskin and Kendal, and during this time, Stark died of asphyxia apparently while being restrained, according to the Brooklyn DA. The plan formulated by Erskin Felix was to extort money from Stark using a conspiracy that included his three cousins. But when the four cousins found out Stark was dead, they rushed back to the scene of the kidnapping to get rid of any evidence. Unfortunately for them, they found the scene flooded with police, so they went to a dumpster in Nassau County, threw his body in it, and set it on fire, the Brooklyn DA said. Around 17 hours later, a Nassau County police officer found Starks partially burned body in the dumpster behind a gas station in Great Neck, Long Island, according to the Brooklyn DA. An autopsy conducted by the Nassau County Medical Examiners Office found that the cause of death was asphyxia by compression of the neck and chest. This indictment is the latest step in our journey toward justice for Menachem Stark, his seven children and the rest of the family his killers took him from, said Acting District Attorney Eric Gonzalez. This was an especially callous crime, where the defendants acted on a desire for money alone, said NYPD Police Commissioner James ONeill. Erskin Felix was arraigned Tuesday in a Brooklyn Supreme Court on second-degree murder and first- and second-degree kidnapping charges, the Brooklyn DA said. If convicted, he faces up to 25 years to life in prison. Kendall Felix and Irvine Henry, the cousins who joined the scene after the kidnapping, were arraigned Tuesday in a Brooklyn Supreme Court, charged with second- and fourth- degree conspiracy, tampering with physical evidence, attempted tampering with physical evidence, and first-degree hindering prosecution. They face up to 25 years in prison if they are convicted. Their next court date is Feb. 8, 2017. Kendel Felix, who allegedly kidnapped Stark with Erskin Felix, was convicted by a jury of first-degree kidnapping and second-degree murder in September 2016.

Supervisor Michael Antonovich cited a recent Los Angeles Times investigation that found a sharp increase over the last two years in the number of county jail inmates being released before serving their full sentences. Antonovich focused on those convicted of serious and violent offenses. Inmates with serious and violent charges are only serving 40 percent of their sentence in county jail, Antonovich said. These offenders were referred to as M7s and faced charges such as child molestation, rape, negligent discharge of a firearm, kidnapping, mayhem, child abuse and aggravated assault. Antonovich attributed the releases to budget cuts, changes in sentencing laws and California legislation that shifted responsibility for lower-level offenders to counties in October 2011. He asked for a report from the Sheriffs Department, including the impact of proposals to contract prisoners out to a former state prison in Kern County run by the city of Taft and to move 528 inmates to fire camps secured by state corrections officers. A report is expected back by Sept. 12.  – City News Service.",1

The LCSO, the Frederick County Sheriffs Office in Maryland, and the Pennsylvania State Police on Tuesday announced the arrests of Roman S. Monzon, 19, Mark A. Hoy Jr., 19, and John A. Dey, 19. Each was charged with breaking and entering to commit robbery, use of a firearm during the commission of a felony and abduction.

The incident occurred on Loyalty Road near Taylorstown in April when a family member answered the door for a delivery, according to the LCSO. One of the suspects forced his way into the home, followed by three other suspects. The suspects were armed and held a family of five against their will while removing items from the home. Once the suspects left, someone from the family ran and contacted the LCSO. No one was injured during the incident. The arrests in this case were made possible through the sharing of information between multiple jurisdictions and the dedication and hard work of personnel from Loudoun County, Frederick County and Pennsylvania, said Loudoun County Sheriff Mike Chapman. These men terrorized a family and deserve to be prosecuted to the full extent that the law allows for this type of crime, said Pennsylvania State Police Lieutenant Robert Johnson, applauding the work of the three agencies in tracking the suspects down. The LCSO released sketches and a photo of the vehicle similar to the suspect vehicle after the Taylorstown incident.

Fearing Hernandez would do more harm to her – and possibly to the boy – she agreed to go with him to Garfield, about 87 miles from Bethlehem. ·  Hernandez would not let her retrieve the infants child-safety seat. He forced her to strap the boy into a vehicle seat with a standard seat belt. ·  Hernandez told her multiple times while driving that he wanted her dead so that he could live a happy life with just the baby.",1

1017,"Police are searching for a man they say followed a Gwinnett County woman from a Walmart parking lot, then tried to abduct her outside her home. Jamez Maclin, 23, is wanted on charges of kidnapping and battery, Gwinnett County Police said Thursday. According to police, a woman was shopping shortly before midnight Wednesday at the Walmart at 3795 Buford Dr. in Buford. When she walked out of the store, she noticed a white BMW parked behind her vehicle. As she drove home, she noticed a car behind her, but didnt realize it was the same vehicle from the parking lot, police said. She pulled into her driveway, got out of her vehicle and walked to the front door of her home. As she opened the door, a man grabbed her from behind. The woman screamed, police say, and when her mother came running to the door, the man released her and ran, driving away in the white BMW. Police responded to her home and the Walmart. Officers located a white BMW in the stores parking lot and say the woman was able to identify Maclin — the registered owner of the car — as the person who tried to kidnap her. They also drove her back to Walmart and she identified the car as the one that had just left her home. At the store, police believe Maclin had walked into the store when they arrived and then ran away on foot. Video surveillance showed the white BMW following the woman when she left the parking lot, police said. Shortly after 8 a.m. Thursday, Maclin called 911 and tried to report his car stolen from an address in Buford, police said. Police responded to the address he gave, but couldnt find him at the scene. Police believe he reported the car stolen in an attempt to cover up the fact he used it during the kidnapping attempt. This was a very dangerous situation that could have ended differently if the woman had not screamed and had help from her mother, Gwinnett County Police spokesman Cpl. Deon Washington said. Police strongly urge women not to shop alone late at night. It is always a good idea to park in well-lit areas and look around your vehicle before you get out of your car. If you have suspicions that you are being followed, do not ignore them, drive to the nearest police precinct or heavily populated area and call 911. Anyone with information in the case is asked to contact detectives at 770-513-5300. To remain anonymous, tipsters may contact Crime Stoppers at 404-577-TIPS (8477) or visit the Crime Stoppers website.

1021,"Demetrius Santrell Ballinger, who was convicted of rape and attempted murder following an August 2012 hostage standoff at the Red Roof Inn in Woodbury, has been sentenced to 36 years in prison.  Ballinger on Monday, Oct. 7, was sentenced on one count of attempted second-degree murder and four counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct for the armed rape of four teenage girls.  Very seldom do we see a case where so many innocents are victimized in such a cruel manner, Washington County Attorney Pete Orput said in a statement. The severity of this sentence recognizes that and we are pleased to finally be able to bring closure to the victims of these heinous acts.  In court on Monday, Ballinger asked the judge for a life sentence, according to the Pioneer Press.  No, I cant do that, Judge Ellen Maas responded, according to the newspaper. This is pretty much the same thing.   Ballinger, 26, of Stillwater, was initially charged with 27 felonies stemming from the Aug. 31 hostage standoff at the motel.  During the incident, Ballinger shot at Mark Henderson, a man who tried to escape and was shot and killed by police during the incident. The officers involved were later cleared.  We are pleased to be able to bring some closure for the victims of this defendants heinous acts. While he will be serving a huge amount of time in prison, it cannot begin to recompense the harm he has caused, Orput said after Ballinger pleaded guilty to five charges in June.  A Washington County team eventually got Ballinger to release the hostages after a four-hour standoff, and Woodbury Det. Chris Rheault was later honored for his efforts.  The incident led to public outcry in Woodbury regarding criminal activity at the motel, and police have since been working with Red Roof Inn management.  Ballinger will likely spend 24 years in prison, the Pioneer Press reported, and if he ever violates his probation he will be sent back to prison for life.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant County Attorney Siv Yurichuk. • • • • For updates and other information about the community, join us on Patch, Like us on Facebook and follow Woodbury on Twitter.",0
1022,"A prosecutor told jurors Wednesday that there is overwhelming evidence against two reputed gang members charged with killing five people at a homeless encampment near a freeway in Long Beach, while attorneys for the men countered that the two had been wrongly accused. In her final argument, Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes told the jury hearing the case against David Cruz Ponce, 36, and Max Eliseo Rafael, 31, that the defendants own jailhouse statements prove their guilt in the Nov. 1, 2008, shooting deaths of Hamid Shraifat, 41, of Signal Hill; Vanessa Malaepule, 34, of Carson; and Frederick Neumeier, 53, Katherine Verdun, 24, and Lorenzo Villicana, 44, of Long Beach. Hes not falsely bragging...Hes a killer and hes bragging about it, Barnes said of one jailhouse recording of Ponce. Of a recorded conversation between Ponce and Rafael, the prosecutor said, If youre Rafael and youre innocent, would you be whispering about it?...Theyre whispering about the details. Hes doing that because hes the other shooter. The evidence proves their clients guilty, Barnes said of the defense attorneys arguments. One of Ponces attorneys, Robert A. Schwartz, countered that the surreptitious tape recordings were made in the upside-down world of county jail in which inmates status and reputation are enhanced by claiming to have been involved in crimes. Ponces lawyer said there is no physical evidence connecting Ponce to the 2008 killings. He told jurors that his clients jailhouse statements are riddled with lies and misstatements showing he wasnt there, and that a lot of information about the slayings was available in media accounts. Rafaels attorney, Marc Lewinstein, asked jurors to determine if the statements were false bravado rather than actual admissions. Max Rafael is not a murderer, Lewinstein told jurors. He urged jurors to set aside their emotions and to be neutral and dispassionate when making your findings after seeing what he called heart- breaking photographs of the victims and hearing recordings of inmates bragging like its some kind of sport. Rafaels attorney has suggested that it was not his client but another man – to whom Villicana allegedly owed money – who was one of the two people who went to the encampment and carried out the attacks. The prosecutor countered in her rebuttal argument that jurors did not hear any evidence that the man was even in Long Beach that day. The seven-woman, five-man panel was sent home for the day shortly after being handed the case. They are due back at the downtown Los Angeles courthouse Friday for deliberations. Ponce and Rafael are charged with five counts of murder for the Long Beach killings. The murder charges include the special circumstance allegations of multiple murders, murder during the commission of a kidnapping, murder of witnesses to a crime and murder while an active participant in a criminal street gang, along with gang allegations. The two men are also charged with kidnapping Shraifat. Ponce – who is facing a possible death sentence if convicted – is also charged with the March 23, 2009, kidnapping and murder of Tony Bledsoe in the Lancaster area, along with possession of a firearm by a felon. Prosecutors opted not to seek the death penalty against Rafael, who could face a maximum of life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted of the killings. After the two were charged, then-Long Beach Police Chief Jim McDonnell said, Id like to make it clear that these victims were not targeted because they were homeless ... This encounter stemmed from a personal vendetta of one of the suspects as the result of an ongoing dispute with one of the victims over narcotics. The other victims were killed to ensure that there were no witnesses to this crime. Ponce and Rafael were charged in January 2012 with the killings and have remained jailed without bail.

1023,"A man charged with coercing a woman into sexual servitude at hotels in Danvers and Saugus has been sentenced to 5-8 years in state prison, Attorney General Maura Healey announced Friday. Steven Diaz, 34, of Everett, was found guilty last week by an Essex Superior Court jury on charges of trafficking of persons for sexual servitude and deriving support from prostitution. Pimps and traffickers, like this one, prey on our most vulnerable residents and profit off of their exploitation, said Healey in a statement. Human trafficking is not a victimless crime. We will continue to prosecute those committing these egregious crimes and to help prevent more victims from being brought into this horrible life. State Police arrested Diaz and Marquis Campbell, of Hyde Park, in May of 2014 following a motor vehicle. A woman in the back of the vehicle asked the state trooper for help. The men were indicted by a grand jury in July 2014. Campbell and Diaz allegedly picked up the woman in the days preceding the arrest and forced her to into prostitution in hotels in several Massachusetts communities, namely Saugus and Danvers, over a three-day period, said a statement from the attorney generals office. The two men took photos of the woman and advertised her on prostitution websites. They also allegedly kept all the money being paid for the sexual services. Campbell allegedly threatened and raped the victim. He is charged with trafficking of persons for sexual servitude, kidnapping, deriving support from prostitution, and two counts of rape. His trial is scheduled for Sept. 12 in Essex Superior Court. Image via Shutterstock",1
1024,"A Princeton man accused of kidnapping and threatening to kill his 20-year-old girlfriend has pleaded guilty to third-degree theft and sentenced to three years probation, the Princeton Packet reports. Benjamin Li, 23, is also prohibited from having contact with the victim. He must undergo counseling for domestic violence and comply with all conditions of a psychological evaluation. Li was arrested on Nov. 28 after a police officer spotted a 2001 Mercedes Benz on Nassau Street at about 11:16 p.m. The officer heard a woman screaming for help from inside the car. The officer stopped the car on Nassau Street near South Tulane Street, and the woman was able to get out of the car on the passenger side. The woman said Li had kidnapped her, and in addition to everything else mentioned above, he punched her in the upper arm and stole her cell phone. The woman was not injured. The incident began in West Windsor, Sgt. Chris Tash previously said. It was later revealed that the two were driving around together when they got into an argument. The woman asked to be let out of the car, but Li refused, driving through several towns over a three-hour period. The drive was so long because Li got lost. During the trial, the defense attorney painted a picture of a couple that had problems on and off for six years, and Li had always intended to let the woman out of the car. During sentencing, the judge acknowledged that Li was seeking help for his personal issues. The attached image of Benjamin Li was previously provided by Princeton Police",1
1025,"A Brooklyn man who brutally beat and stabbed his ex-girlfriend before he was shot by police has been sentenced to 23.5 years in prison, prosecutors said on Thursday. Brian Quattrocchi, 39, was convicted in March of attempted murder and kidnapping in the January 2015 assault. Quattrocchi attacked his ex-girlfriend inside her Lower East Side apartment twice, the second time sending her to the hospital, according to Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance said. For more news from the Lower East Side, subscribe here for free breaking news alerts and updates from Patch. First, Quattrocchi went to the womans apartment, and, when she asked him to leave, hit her so forcefully that he split her lip, the New York Times reported at the time. Just 10 days later Quattrocchi returned. Prosecutors say that Quattrocchi hit the woman and knocked her to the ground, before repeatedly kicking her prone body. When the woman managed to escape to a different room in the apartment, Quattrocchi barricaded the door against responding police officers and followed the woman into a bathroom with a knife. After officers broke down the door, Quattrocchi threatened both police and the woman with the knife before stabbing his ex-girlfriend repeatedly in her chest until he was shot by police, prosecutors proved at trial. Both Quattrocchi and the woman were treated for their injuries and survived. Police said they had tried to arrest Quattrocchi after he split the womans lip, but were unable to locate him until they responded to the second attack, the Times reported. For the second time this week, justice has been served in a brutal domestic violence assault case. Sadly, it came too late for one of the victims, Vance said in a statement, referring to a man found guilty of murdering his ex-girlfriend in Harlem. Brian Quattrocchis years of inflicting physical, mental, and emotional abuse on his ex-girlfriend culminated in this vicious and terrifying attack. It easily could have turned fatal, if not for the bravery of the heroic responding NYPD officers. In a report released last month, Mayor Bill de Blasios office said that domestic violence accounted for one in every five homicides and two in every five assaults citywide.

1026,"Three four-legged recruits have joined the Tampa Police Department and made their debut today outside the agencys downtown headquarters. Camden Property Trust and the Jimmy Ryce Center for Victims of Predatory Abduction recently donated monies to allow the department to purchase three working dogs. The property management group donated money to purchase Camden, a Belgian Malinois, and the Jimmy Ryce Center donated two bloodhound puppies, Ellie Mae and Riley. Camden is 17 months old and has been partnered with Cpl. M.W. Wade Turner as a patrol dog and explosives detection dog. Delivered last Wednesday, the dog has approximately 700 hours of patrol and odor classes to complete training over the next 14 weeks, Turner said. Ellie Mae and Riley are 12 weeks old and come from the same litter. They are the third and fourth bloodhounds the Jimmy Ryce Foundation have donated to Tampa Police. Ellie May will be partnered with K-9 Officer Sandy Learned, and Riley will be partnered with K-9 Officer Ray Wurst. The bloodhounds will be trained on tracking missing children and homicide victims. Tampa Police use 22 dogs from six breeds trained in suspect captures, search and rescue, and drug and bomb detection. The dogs are recertified each year through the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Police K-9s become certified either as a dual purpose or a single purpose dog. Single purpose dogs, like Ellie Mae and Riley, have one job: search and rescue, drug detection or sniffing out explosives. Dual purpose dogs, like Camden, catch suspects and have another job, such as searching for explosives or drugs. The dogs live with their human partners, and when they retire they spend their golden years as a pet of their handler or another officer. Camden is Turners third canine partner. The Jimmy Ryce Center was established in 1996 in honor of Jimmy Ryce, a 9-year-old boy who was kidnapped at gunpoint from his school bus stop in 1995, sexually assaulted and shot as he tried to escape. Since then, the Center has given more than 500 tracking dogs to police departments nationwide, said representative Hilary Sessions, who was on hand at the debut event. Sessions described these dogs as a tool to help officers do their jobs. They may have their utility belts and their guns … but this is a super extension, she said. Camden Property Trust Vice President Ed Malone said his companys $3,500 donation to the police department was an absolute natural. It was our honor and a privilege to be able to do it, he said.",0
1027,"By Mike Carraggi and Alex Newman In a case that fueled heated debate reaching far beyond the borders of New Englands largest town, rape and related charges against four undocumented immigrants were dropped Thursday after the man and woman who had said they were attacked refused to testify. The alleged victims told prosecutor Joseph Gentile that providing details of the attack — if such an attack ever happened — would violate their 5th Amendment rights because it could incriminate them, the MetroWest Daily News reported. The decision to drop the charges was announced Thursday afternoon at Framingham District Court. Prosecutors said they had issues with the victims statement. As details emerged about the four men accused, all from Guatemala, much scrutiny was placed on the countrys immigration policies among those who consider the system broken. Two of the men had previously been deported for past crimes. They were accused of cornering a woman and her boyfriend on Claflin Street as they enjoyed an evening out in town on March 13. The boyfriend told the Boston Herald the four men surrounded him and his girlfriend after one man offered them a beer. According to the Herald, police said one of the suspects held up a condom and indicated that he wanted the mans girlfriend. Three of them then dragged the woman to an apartment on the corner of the street while the largest of the four kept the boyfriend at bay. Police said at the time that the three men then attempted to blockade the door with a dresser and started climbing on top of the woman and groping her, the Herald reported. Elmer Diaz also reportedly reached into the womans pants and digitally penetrated her while holding a pen knife, the Metro West Daily News reported. The boyfriend eventually forced his way into the apartment, fighting off the attackers to help his girlfriend escape, police said at the time. He was also injured during the assault. Police quickly responded and arrested the four men. They found the boyfriends missing cellphone and clothing the woman said the men who attacked her were wearing in the apartment where two of the suspects reside. Elmer Diaz, 19, was charged with rape, assault with a dangerous weapon, kidnapping and threatening to commit a crime; his brother, Ariel Diaz, 24, faced charges of unarmed robbery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, indecent assault and battery, kidnapping and witness intimidation; a third Diaz brother, 32-year-old Adan, and Marlon Josue Jarquin-Felipe, 27, were charged with indecent assault and battery and kidnapping stemming from last weeks alleged assault.",1

According to a Iowa City Police media release, officers responded to Petland on Feb. 22 for the report of a stolen dog-- a young poodle. After information about the theft, including video footage of the suspects, was released by Petland, the Iowa City Police received numerous calls from the public identifying a potential suspect. An Iowa City Police complaint states that the footage from the incident on Feb. 10 showed an older female and a younger female leaving the Petland store with a miniature poodle in their possession. See Also: Officers then followed up on this information, located the suspect, and recovered the poodle, returning it to Petland unharmed.

1036,"Two men were extradited and returned to Orange County on multiple rape charges, on Tuesday, one from a border crossing in Nogales, Arizona. The two men, both 36-years-old, were in custody Tuesday on charges of raping an 11-year-old girl multiple times in Santa Ana in 1999. Ismael F. Salgado of Chicago, who was arrested Oct. 14, and Jose Andres Plascencia, who was being brought back to Orange County Tuesday, face one count each of kidnapping to commit rape and five counts each of rape, all felonies, according to police and court records. The defendants were accused of picking up the 11-year-old as she walked home with a friend near Jerome Center in Santa Ana around 5:30 p.m. Feb. 3, 1999, according to Santa Ana police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna.As they pulled up alongside the girls they tried to talk them into the car, but the 11-year-old girl said she didnt want to, prompting one of the men to grab her and force her into the vehicle along with her friend, Bertagna said. The friend managed to get away, but when the other girl tried to make her escape she was dragged back into the car by her hair, Bertagna said. The defendants drove to a gas station near Raitt Street and Edinger Avenue and fueled up the car while one of the men held his hand over the girls mouth so she couldnt summon help, Bertagna said. The girl was sexually assaulted in a secluded parking lot in Santa Ana, then was driven to another parking area where she was sexually assaulted again, Bertagna said. Detectives were not able to make any arrests at the time, but investigators reopened the case recently and submitted DNA evidence to the countys crime lab, Bertagna said. A DNA match was made with Salgado, who lived in Santa Ana for most of his life but recently moved to Chicago, Bertagna said. DNA evidence also pointed to another man, who was not in the system, Bertagna said. Police began looking at known associates of Salgado at the time of the attack and narrowed in on Plascencia when the victim identified him from a photograph, Bertagna said. Plascencia, who is living in Laveen, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, was placed under surveillance, Bertagna said. Investigators collected a discarded water bottle Plascencia drank from at a local gym and sent it to the crime lab, which matched his DNA to the evidence collected at the 1999 rapes, Bertagna alleged. Salgado was arrested at his home in Chicago on Oct. 5. He made his first court appearance Oct. 17 and is due to be arraigned Friday. Plascencia was arrested Nov. 6 at a border crossing in Nogales, Arizona, Bertagna said. City News Service contributed to this report.",1

The three have been connected to at least four separate crimes at alleged brothels between Sept. 27 and Sept. 28, detectives with the San Jose, Milpitas, Fremont and South San Francisco police departments discovered. The men are accused of murdering Xingjian Li of San Gabriel on Sept. 28 just after 8:40 p.m. in the 300 block of Elan Village Lane in San Jose, according to police. The location was operating as a brothel, police said. Responding officers found Li was suffering from at least one gunshot. He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Prior to the murder, the men allegedly sexually assaulted three women during separate robberies at other brothels in Milpitas, Fremont and South San Francisco. The first alleged crime occurred on Sept. 27 and was initially reported as a suspicious circumstance in the 500 block of Murphy Ranch Road in Milpitas at 10:26 a.m. There, officers encountered a female victim who said she had been robbed and sexually assaulted. A few hours later, another female victim was allegedly robbed and sexually assaulted in the 100 block of McLellan Drive in South San Francisco. That victim, however, didnt report the incident until two days later. Hours before the Sept. 28 murder in San Jose, police in Fremont responded to a home invasion robbery at a undisclosed location. Three women said they were robbed at gunpoint and one reported being sexually assaulted.

1041,"The family of Aaron Sofer, a Lakewood man missing in Israel since Friday, pleaded with any potential kidnappers to send the 23-year-old student home at a news conference Tuesday, held by Lakewood Mayor Menashe Miller. Please bring back my brother, Yaakov Sofer, the missing mans brother-in-law said, according to the Asbury Park Press. Hes a very nice boy. Please bring him back. Two congressman said Tuesday theyre using all resources to ensure the safe homecoming of an Ocean County man who may have been kidnapped while hiking in Israel. Congressman Chris Smith and Sen. Robert Menendez say they have been actively involved in ensuring that both the Israeli and U.S. governments locate Sofer, who was studying in Israel until he went missing Friday. Congressional and law enforcement authorities say theyre pursuing the possibility that Aaron Sofer, 23, may have been victim to an attack by Palestinian militants. The crisis between Israelis and Palestinians has heated up recently with the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, according to The Associated Press. Sofer went with a friend on a hike in the Jerusalem forest this past Friday until his friend lost sight of him at 12 noon. I am deeply concerned over the disappearance of New Jersey student Aaron Sofer in Israel and I stand in solidarity with his family. My thoughts are with them and the Lakewood community during this trying time, Senator Menendez said. By all accounts, Aaron is a devout and dedicated student, who travelled to Israel to enhance his knowledge and deepen his understanding of sacred Jewish texts. Menendez says his office has worked very closely with the State Department, U.S. Embassy and Consular officials in Israel, and the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., and investigators are pursuing every lead. There has been no trace of him so far, leading to fears that he may have been kidnapped. Patch will be following this story and will report any updates as they are made available.

1045,"Lauren Brown made several demands during the recent Suwanee SWAT standoff with Gwinnett Police, but his desired outcome was obvious to one of his hostages. My personal opinion, Tim Hollingsworth said Tuesday, was that he wanted to board up the house, kill us, set the house on fire, and then let the fire department come in and put out the fire. He wanted so bad to see it on TV. Hollingsworth and the four other Gwinnett Fire and Emergency Services officers held hostage by Brown discussed the incident publicly for the first time at fire department headquarters Tuesday (April 16). The other fire officers were Jody Moss, Jason Schuon, Chip Echols and Sydney Garner. Brown, who lived at 2440 Walnut Grove Way, was shot to death in a gunfire exchange with a Gwinnett Police SWAT officer April 10. That officer, who since has been released from the hospital, was identified as Sgt. Jason Teague. Browns possible desire to see the incident on television was not lost on Schuon, who quickly undid the cable box at the house. Genius, was how Gwinnett Police Capt. Jake Smith, who was at the news conference, described that move. Smith added Tuesday that Brown fired six shots when SWAT officers entered the house. Teague, the Gwinnett officer, fired about 15. Brown did not take long to reveal that his 911 call was a ruse. Now for the real reason youre here, he told the firefighters. He pulled a revolver on them and pulled back bed covers to reveal two more handguns. Later in the ordeal, he produced two more WWII-era weapons from his closet. He made his hostages take off their shirts to show him they were not armed. He said (the ordeal) would turn out exactly the way he envisioned it. Early on, Hollingsworth suggested that he brew a pot of coffee, as a mood lightener. There were coffee grounds all over -- I was shaking.

Imagine answering your phone and being told that if you dont send the caller a certain amount of money, theyll kill your son. It might sound like something terrible or the plot of a Hollywood drama, but the Pasco County Sheriffs Office says its happening in Land O Lakes. They get the victim acting on their emotions to go immediately to a store and send the money instead of calling their relative, a Sheriffs Office spokesperson writes in a press release. In recent incidents, the callers have told victims that a family member was involved in a traffic accident in which they were at fault. In one case the caller told a man that he was holding his son in his basement and if his demands werent met, he would bury him in a hole. In that case, the victim was with his brother who was able to contact family members and discover that no one was actually being held hostage. In another case, a woman in Land O Lakes wired $300 to an account before she realized that it was a scam.

1049,"A South Jersey womans nightmare scenario in which her children were kidnapped by someone else took a turn for the worse when charges were filed against her. Kyna C. Garnett, 32, of Lawnside, was charged today on a summons with one count of fourth-degree abuse and neglect, Camden County Prosecutor Mary Eva Colalillo said on Wednesday. Garnett left her Chevrolet Traverse running with her 10-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son inside when she went to Colombo Liquors on the 500 block of the White Horse Pike in Magnolia around 11:30 p.m. on Saturday night. Surveillance footage from businesses in the area allegedly show 38-year-old Christopher R. Dumas, of Paulsboro, getting into the car and driving away with the children inside just 30 seconds after Garnett left the vehicle and went into the store. Garnett was allegedly in the store for several minutes. Dumas later allegedly crashed the stolen vehicle into a Suzuski SUV at Merchant Street and Hampshire Avenue in Audubon. Dumas, the two children and a 48-year-old Mount Ephraim woman who was driving the other car were all taken to Cooper University Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Dumas is charged with three counts each of aggravated assault and assault by auto, two counts each of kidnapping and endangering the welfare of a child and one count each of theft, receiving stolen property and eluding. He is being held at the Camden County Jail with bail set at $617,500. Garnett was processed and released on her own recognizance. A recent Supreme Court ruling determined that leaving a young child in a car is not abuse or neglect, according to nj.com. The court ruled in August that simply leaving a child alone in a vehicle is not neglect. The decision was unanimous in a 7-0 vote. That ruling came in a case in which a woman was found guilty of child endangerment in 2014 after leaving her 19-month-old daughter alone in a car. The child in that case was unharmed. In reversing that decision, the court decided the woman deserved a hearing in which all the cases facts were considered. That case is unclear because, despite a public safety message posted on the states website advising against it, there is no specific state law in New Jersey against leaving children in a car unattended.",1
1050,"Police departments in Grosse Pointe Woods and Grosse Pointe Farms, as well as 20 law enforcement officials, were named as defendants in a $100 million federal lawsuit filed Tuesday by the family of a woman who allege police covered up her murder when they ruled her death a suicide. The body of JoAnn Matouk Romain, 55, of Grosse Pointe Woods was found near the Canadian shore of Lake St. Clair four years ago, The Detroit News reports. She had disappeared on Jan. 12, 2010, and her body was found two months later. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court by the Southfield-based 1-800-Law-Firm on behalf of the womans family, attorneys allege Grosse Pointe Farms authorities gave the case only a cursory look before turning it over to Grosse Point Woods officials. Both departments treated the investigation as a suicide by drowning from the moment JoAnn went missing, the lawsuit states. JoAnn did not commit suicide; none of the facts or evidence support the absurd conclusion that she committed suicide. The named police departments ignored witness statements, falsified their police reports and their investigation to make her murder appear to be a suicide. Police said their investigation revealed footprints in the snow leading from Matouk Romains Lexus in the parking lot of St. Paul Catholic Church in Grosse Pointe Farms to the lake. There were no footprints to suggest she returned to the car. In a news conference Wednesday, Michelle Romain of St. Clair Shores, the dead womans daughter, said her mother thought she was being followed in the months before her disappearance, the Detroit Free Press reports. The weeks preceding her disappearance, she had told us that she felt as if she was being followed and if anything happened to her to make sure that we followed through, and the night that she disappeared I made a vow to my siblings and to God that I would follow through with what she said, Romain said. At the news conference, Attorney Solomon Radner said the evidence shows Matouk Romain struggled when she was abducted, then killed and dumped in the lake, WDIV, Channel 4, reports. That evidence reportedly includes a brand new purse that was torn and fresh bruises on her left arm. The family also questioned the footprints police said indicated Matouk Romain had walked into the frigid lake were likely made by a mans boot, and not the high-heeled boots she was wearing. They also wondered how the body could have moved 30 miles when there was no current in the lake.",0

1055,"After 48 long days in the hospital, we both got to see home for the first time today, Hayley Shelton wrote on Friday after her husband, Oregon State Trooper Nic Cederberg made it home. Cederberg had been shot on Christmas Day by a man who had just murdered his wife. It was so surreal walking through our front door together and seeing all of our Christmas presents re-wrapped in Valentines Day paper and really realizing how much time has actually passed. We are different people than we were when we both left home for our shifts on Christmas, and we both agree we will be better from these events. (For more alerts and other Portland news, click here to get Patchs daily newsletter and free, real-time news alerts for your Portland metro neighborhood.) Cederberg is a seven-year veteran of the State Police assigned to North Plains. He previously served in the United States Army. We consider Nic Cederberg a hero, said Oregon State Police Spokesman Capt. Bill Fugate at a press conference days after the shooting. He undoubtedly saved the lives of members of the community and other police officers. He has a long road of recovery ahead of him. The incident was the second time that Cederberg had been involved in a shooting while on duty. In October 2015, he and another trooper were involved in a shootout with Andrew DeHart on Highway 26. DeHart fired 99 times while Cederberg and his partner fired 32 times. DeHart, who had been wanted on attempted murder and kidnapping charges, was not hit but later shot and killed himself. Cederbergs brother has established a GoFundMe page to help the family. For now, Shelton - who is a Portland Police Officer - says the focus is moving forward one day at a time. We are now living life with a newfound appreciation for every single moment, as tomorrow is never promised, she wrote. Want to get more Portland news?

CBS-6 in Charlottesville also cites sources saying that Matthew has been charged. The Albemarle County Police Department and the Commonwealths Attorney have scheduled a press conference for Tuesday at 11 a.m. The police department issued a statement Monday saying: We will be providing an update in the Jesse Matthew case. Albemarle County Police Chief, Colonel Steve Sellers and Albemarle County Commonwealths Attorney, Denise Lunsford will be speaking at the press conference.

Graham, 18, disappeared Sept. 13 in Charlottesville, where she was a sophomore at the University of Virginia; the search for the missing teen gripped the nation and made worldwide news. Hearts sank when her remains were found in October at an abandoned property in southern Albemarle County about 12 miles from where she was last seen. Graham graduated from West Potomac High School in the Alexandria area of Fairfax County. Matthew is already charged with the abduction of Graham, 18, from Charlottesvilles downtown mall. Grahams life was celebrated by hundreds of friends and family members in November. Matthew is also a suspect in two similar incidents. Grahams body was discovered about five miles from where student Morgan Harringtons body was found in 2010 in Albemarle County.

1061,"SANTA CLARA - A Santa Clara man who stabbed four people at the University of California at Merced in November may have self-radicalized himself and drawn inspiration from terrorist propaganda, FBI officials said Thursday. Faisal Mohammad, 18, was a student at UC Merced where he stabbed four people in a classroom building before he was fatally shot by a campus police officer on the morning of Nov. 4, FBI officials said. Also on Patch: The federal agencys Fresno Area Joint Terrorism Task Force responded to the scene and opened an investigation that included interviews and inspection of Mohammads electronics, according to the FBI. The 18-year-olds laptop had propaganda that supported the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, commonly known as ISIL, FBI officials said. In the weeks leading up to Nov. 4 attack, Mohammad visited websites of ISIL and other extremist groups, according to FBI. The investigation also indicated he started getting ready for the attack a week before on his own, FBI officials said. Mohammad wore a backpack during the attack that carried a two-page handwritten manifesto on his plans to take in hostages and kill students and police officers, according to the FBI. The backpack also contained a copy of an ISIL flag, FBI officials said. Handcuffs, zip ties, two clear bags of petroleum jelly, a safety hammer and duct tape were also found in the bag, according to Merced County sheriffs officials. There were no signs that Mohammad had any co-conspirators or links with foreign terrorist organizations, but investigators noted they might never learn why he attacked people on the campus, according to the FBI. The victims were two students, a staff member and a contractor who were all treated for their injuries, UC Merced officials said. We are relieved to finally have resolution to this very tragic event on the UC Merced campus. This concludes the investigation, which was a cooperative effort that could not have been as successful without the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, UC Merced Chancellor Dorothy Leland said in a statement Thursday. I am proud of the way our campus community came together in the aftermath of this incident, and the kindness displayed by so many only reinforced what I already knew to be true about UC Merced. Now, we move to the task of further healing and taking care of the needs of our students, staff and faculty, Leland said. -By Bay City News Service, image via ShutterStock",0
1062,"SAN JOSE - A trial was delayed again Monday for a man facing kidnapping and murder charges for the disappearance of Sierra LaMar four years ago in unincorporated Morgan Hill. Antolin Garcia-Torres, 25, waived his right for a speedy trial within 60 days during his appearance at the Hall of Justice in San Jose. Garcia-Torres attorney Alfonso Lopez in court Monday said he planned to file three motions to suppress evidence, sever the charges and change the trial venue. Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Vanessa Zecher granted the extension for the defense attorneys to file their motions, which prosecutors will respond to within 30 days. Brian Matthews, another attorney for Garcia-Torres, wont be available until another trial hes working on wraps up at the end of July, according to Lopez. Sierra, 15, was last seen on March 16, 2012, leaving home for school and her body hasnt been found despite numerous community searches in the past four years. Garcia-Torres was accused of Sierras disappearance and death after her DNA was found in his car, a red Volkswagen Jetta, according to prosecutors. The defendant was indicted on the charges involving Sierra in 2014 by a grand jury, who also charged him with kidnapping and carjacking three other women in Morgan Hill in 2009. Another hearing on the case was scheduled for June 17, when Judge Zecher will hear the motions from the defense and look into setting a trial date. Roger Nelson, one of three search volunteers at Mondays hearing, said outside of court that he couldnt imagine the pain the LaMar family has been going through. Its good to see that there is progress being made and that a trial is forthcoming, but its been a long four years, Nelson said. If the trial is moved out of the county, Nelson said it would be inconvenient for the LaMar family, who has suffered enough. One challenge in the trial is selecting a jury with people who arent familiar with the case, said legal analyst Steven Clark, a former prosecutor with the county. The judge has to balance the right of Mr. Garcia-Torres to a fair trial and also look at the fact that generally change of venue motions are not favored and very expensive and very cumbersome, Clark said. Clark also pointed to the similar community emotional involvement Garcia-Torres case has with that of Scott Peterson, who was convicted of murdering his wife Laci and her unborn son in San Joaquin County in 2002. If the change of venue motion is approved, the case could see further delays because the states Judicial Council would have to select another location for Garcia-Torres trial, Clark said.

1063,"A Stoughton man will spend two decades behind bars for his role in a 2016 kidnapping that occurred in Quincy. Sedrick Oliveira, 26, was sentenced in U.S. District Court Thursday to 20 years in prison and five years of supervised release. In March, he pleaded guilty to kidnapping. In October 2016, a 30-year-old man was kidnapped from the driveway of his Quincy home at Marina Bay after being struck in the head with a revolver as he got out of his truck, and dragged into a nearby sedan. The victim had two children strapped into car seats in his truck, as well as approximately 30 pounds of marijuana at the time of the assault, according to the U.S. Attorneys office. Once the victim was in the sedan, two masked men, later identified as 23-year-old Diego Pires of Brockton and 20-year-old Malik Bangura of Taunton, drove the victims truck, with the children still inside, to a secluded location where they unloaded the marijuana and $20,000 from the victims truck, into the sedan. The victim, who was face-down in the backseat of the sedan at gunpoint, begged for his life and the life of the two children who were still in their car seats in the back of his truck. Pires, Bangura, 23-year-old Yesenia Diaz of Brockton, and Oliveira then drove the sedan with the drugs, cash and the victim, from Quincy to Brockton and called the victims wife demanding $100,000. Law enforcement officers spotted the sedan as it drove through Brockton, recognized the vehicle from an August 2016 drive-by shooting, and began to follow it. The four attempted to flee police but ended up abandoning the sedan in a Brockton driveway. The victim escaped, flagged down law enforcement officers, and described to them the secluded location where the truck had been deserted. Law enforcement located the truck with the children inside, who were unharmed, according to the U.S. Attorneys office. Diaz was arrested after he was found near the van, Oliveira was arrested in October 2017 in Stoughton, Bangura was arrested in April 2017, and Pires was a fugitive until he was apprehended in October 2017. Pires was sentenced last week to 201 years in prison, Bangura as sentenced in January to 17 years in prison, and Diaz is scheduled to be sentenced in September.

1064,"- Gwinnett County Police are seeking an accused rapist and kidnapper who they say may be armed and is considered extremely dangerous. Alfredo L. Capote, 29, of Atlanta, is accused of a violent, days-long attack in which he allegedly tied up a teenager and kidnapped the teens mother, raping her repeatedly after staging a robbery at her home. Police were called to a Duluth home Friday by a 17-year-old boy who told them that the previous day, Capote -- his mothers boyfriend -- stopped by to visit. A short time later, a masked man entered the home and tied up the son and his 35-year-old mother. Capote then told the mother that he was staging a home invasion because he needed her money. He raped her at gunpoint, police say, then tied her up again. The son was told not to call police or his mother would be killed. The son was able to free himself hours later. The two suspects left with the mother and went to a hotel in Cobb County, where the suspects parted ways. The victim spent the night at the hotel with Capote, where police say he held her at gunpoint and raped her again. Police say Capote and the victim left the hotel the following morning and traveled to a home in Perry, Georgia. After leaving that home, the suspect saw an opportunity to escape and jumped out of a moving vehicle near an intersection. She jumped into a strangers vehicle in a parking lot and pleaded for help, police say. Police were called and she was rescued at about 4 p.m. Friday. Capote, who stands about 5-foot-10 and weighs about 150 pounds, has ties to the Atlanta area and is a native of Louisiana. Police say he does not have an extensive criminal history, but is considered extremely dangerous because of the nature of his alleged crimes. The suspect has made statements about shooting it out with police and this being the end, Gwinnett County Police spokesman Cpl. Deon Washington said in a news release. This was a brutal and prolonged assault against the victim. We are working with several law enforcement agencies in hopes of apprehending the suspect as soon as possible. Capote is wanted on charges of rape, armed robbery, false imprisonment and kidnapping.",1
1065,"A gang member convicted of the murders of five people at a homeless encampment near a Long Beach freeway nearly a decade ago was sentenced Thursday to five consecutive life prison terms without the possibility of parole. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charlaine Olmedo called the circumstances of the crime particularly cruel and vicious and told Max Eliseo Rafael that he will have a long time to think about what transpired. The judge cited jailhouse statements made by Rafael and co-defendant David Cruz Ponce, saying those were very damaging evidence against the two. Really, its their own words that provide the sufficiency of the evidence ..., Olmedo said, noting that there was also independent evidence that linked Rafael to the shootings. Rafael, 31, and Ponce, 37, were convicted last Sept. 22 of first- degree murder for the Nov. 1, 2008, shooting deaths of Hamid Shraifat, 41, of Signal Hill; Vanessa Malaepule, 34, of Carson; and Frederick Neumeier, 53, Katherine Verdun, 24, and Lorenzo Villicana, 44, of Long Beach. Along with the five murders, Ponce and Rafael were convicted of kidnapping Shraifat, and jurors found true the special circumstance allegations of multiple murders, murder during the commission of a kidnapping and murder while an active participant in a criminal street gang, along with gang and gun allegations against the two. Ponce was also convicted of first-degree murder for the March 23, 2009, kidnapping and shooting death of Tony Bledsoe, 18, in the Lancaster area, along with two counts of unlawfully possessing a firearm. Jurors recommended the death penalty last Oct. 2 for Ponce, who is set to be formally sentenced Feb. 15. After Rafael and Ponce were charged in January 2012 with the killings, then-Long Beach Police Chief Jim McDonnell said, Id like to make it clear that these victims were not targeted because they were homeless ... This encounter stemmed from a personal vendetta of one of the suspects as the result of an ongoing dispute with one of the victims over narcotics. The other victims were killed to ensure that there were no witnesses to this crime. Villicanas brother, Pablo, told the defendants, You two gentlemen are evil. He said he didnt have much hope in the system when his brother was killed, but his perspective has changed since then. A woman who had adopted Verduns son in an open adoption told the judge that Verdun was so much more than a homeless person. She wanted him to have the kind of life she couldnt give him ... She put his needs before her own, the woman said of Verdun. Thats the difference between Kat and her murderers. Rafael initially declined to speak during the hearing, then told the judge that his only fault was being tied to a lifestyle that never gave me anything. The judge – who noted that Rafael had denied responsibility for the crime – told him that he is a young man who has decades ahead to do a lot of introspection. During the trial, Rafaels attorney, Marc Lewinstein, had suggested the statements made by his client were false bravado rather than actual admissions. Max Rafael is not a murderer, Lewinstein told jurors. One of Ponces attorneys, Robert A. Schwartz, told jurors that the surreptitious tape recordings were made in the upside-down world of county jail in which inmates status and reputation are enhanced by claiming to have been involved in crimes. Ponces lawyer maintained there was no physical evidence connecting Ponce to the killings; that his clients jailhouse statements were riddled with lies and misstatements showing he wasnt there; and that a lot of information about the slayings was available in media accounts.

1071,"It was almost midnight when 11-year-old Deja Chambers heard a knock on her grandparents apartment door. When she answered it, she found a naked, handcuffed woman standing outside shaking. Chambers was the first witness today in the rape trial of Jason Anthony Bill, a former Cobb County sheriffs deputy. Bill, 40, is charged with the kidnapping, assault and rape of an illegal woman from El Salvador. The two lived in the same apartment complex, Harmony Meadows, off S. Cobb Drive in Marietta. After escaping from Bill, the woman knocked on the door of the apartment where Deja Chambers was staying, according to opening remarks by the prosecutor. Assistant District Attorney Chuck Boring said that evidence in the trial would show that Bill used his influence as a law enforcement officer to kidnap the alleged victim, who speaks very little English, and get her back to his apartment. Abuse of power and praying on the weak, Boring said, Thats what this case is about. As Boring told the jury about the graphic testimony they would hear, Bill stared at the defense table. Wearing a charcoal gray pinstriped suit, the Iraq war veteran sat at the end of the table with his two attorneys Defense Attorney Philip Holloway said that the alleged victim is lying and that her motivations are financial. She has filed a lawsuit against Bill, the county and the apartment complex, Holloway said. They chose to ignore her inconsistent statements, Holloway said. Their biggest assumption is that she was telling the truth. Holloway also said that as a certified crime victim by prosecutors, the woman can file for a certain kind of visa, allowing her to stay in this country with her child. On the night of July 14, 2008, Bill was at a local bar and restaurant, the Corona, in Marietta. He had been drinking, Boring said. Bill became angry at the alleged victim, a waitress in the bar, and accused her of stealing his cell phone, Boring said. Bill showed her his badge and told her she was coming with him. Bill put the alleged victim in his truck and handcuffed her before taking her back to his apartment where he held a gun to her head and made her perform oral sex, Boring said. Bill raped and beat her with a belt before she was able to escape while Bill answered a knock at his door, Boring said. The woman ran to the neighbors house and pointed at Bill as he rode by on his motorcycle, according to trial testimony. It wasnt until police arrived that the Spanish-speaking woman could be understood completely. Bill was arrested the same night. Hes charged with kidnapping, two counts of aggravated assault, aggravated sodomy, rape and false imprisonment. The alleged victim, through an interpreter, had begun her testimony as the day came to a close. The trial is expected to run into next week.",1
1072,"A jilted Joliet man pulled a gun on his ex-girlfriend, bound her wrists and forced her into a car, police said, but got caught by the cops after he drove off with her. Vincente Pedrosa, 36, ambushed his former girlfriend when she returned home to her Pioneer Road apartment Monday night, police said, brandishing what turned out to be a BB gun and abducting her.

1073,"- An armed intruder is dead after a father and son took him down after they were forced to an ATM in an attempted robbery, DeKalb County authorities said Wednesday. The perpetrator, who has not been named, was shot possibly with his own firearm, according to news reports. The harrowing incident began with a home invasion around 2 a.m. at The Oaks at Stonecrest apartment complex on Evans Mill Road in Lithonia. The family apparently didnt have money at their residence, so they were abducted, police said. (To get notified of more local news like this, click here to sign up for the Lithonia Patch. Or find your Atlanta-area town here. Or, if you have an iPhone, download the free Patch app.) The would-be robber made the dad and teenaged son get into a truck and drive to a SunTrust Bank near the Mall at Stonecrest off Interstate 20, DeKalb police Lt. Shane Stanfield told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. While the gunman was backing the truck into a parking space at the ATM, a commotion ensued, according to Stanfield. We believe that the suspect possibly brought them here to retrieve money from the ATM. Once they got to the location, I guess the victims of the home invasion thought they possibly had a chance to get away and a struggle ensued, Stanfield told WSB-TV. Thats when the shots were fired. At least two shots went off, according to WAGA-TV, with the would-be robber being struck at least one. Father and son are unharmed and cooperating in the investigation, authorities said.

1075,"On Aug. 6, a Walmart shopper reported an attempted kidnapping in the parking lot. The woman told a deputy with the Barrow County Sheriffs Office she was entering the store when she was approached by a driver in a white truck she had just seen at the stores filling station. The man reportedly asked if she needed a ride, to which she responded she had a car. He then told her she was beautiful, but the complainant said she was not looking for a compliment, as she was in her church clothes. She nonetheless thanked the driver and, at that point, he reportedly told her to wait because he wanted to show her something. Reaching underneath a white towel in his passenger seat, the man reportedly pulled out a black object she first thought was a gun but believed could have been Mace. The driver then demanded the woman get in the truck. When she told him no, he again demanded she get inside the vehicle. She told him she was going to scream, at which point he reportedly fled the scene. On the same date, a shopper reported almost being struck by a white PT cruiser in the crosswalk at one of the store entrances. A deputy viewed video footage of the incident and observed the vehicle fail to stop for the complainant before maneuvering around the woman, who did stop. The complainant said she stopped to confront the driver. Read more local police and fire news.",0
1076,"Law enforcement in multiple states and jurisdictions worked together to safely bring back a 6-year-old girl after she was abducted by her father following a Bridgeport homicide. Aylin Sofia Hernandez, 6, of Bridgeport was taken by her father Oscar Hernandez, 39, after he fatally stabbed his estranged wife Nidia Gonzalez, 26, of Bridgeport, police said. Her life has changed forever, Bridgeport Police Chief AJ Perez said about Aylin. She lost her mom, she lost her father… hopefully this community will embrace her. Police were called to a Greenwood Street apartment shortly before 3 a.m. on a report of a disturbance. They found a grisly crime scene. Gonzalez was pronounced dead at the scene and another woman was rushed to the hospital for treatment of numerous stab wounds. The woman, believed to be Gonzalezs friend is in critical, but stable condition, police said. Preliminary information suggests that Gonzalez and the other woman were at a local club and returned to the Greenwood Street apartment sometime before the assault occurred. A dispute turned violent and ended with the stabbing. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told WFSB that Hernandez has a prior felony conviction for assault and threatening from 2002 and that he was deported in 2013 to his native El Salvador. Ice has placed an immigration detainer with the Bridgeport Police Department. Police quickly gathered information that Hernandez was likely heading to New York State and an Amber Alert was issued. The alert expanded to Pennsylvania when police received information that he was likely heading to the state. Around 11:15 a.m. a Pennslyvania State Police trooper spotted Hernandezs vehicle and engaged police in a pursuit. He was taken into custody after his vehicle crashed. A few police officers, Hernandez and his daughter sustained minor injuries. Police are making arrangements through the state Department of Children and Families to return the girl to her family. Hernandez will be charged with murder by Bridgeport Police. Its unclear what the extradition process from Pennsylvania will entail at this time. He will face charges in Pennsylvania. Police arent sure yet whether Hernandez and Gonzalez were still in a dating relationship or if they were totally estranged.

Jeremiah Owens, 28, and Christopher White, 27, each face nine years in prison if convicted. According to the Sheriffs Department, the victim was in front of her familys home in the 1600 block of Neptune Avenue about 5:30 p.m. on July 26 when a slim man in board shorts – alleged to be Owens – grabbed her from behind, tackled her and pinned her to the ground. As the assailant tried to drag the teen toward a nearby pickup truck occupied by a second man – alleged to be White – she was able to break free and run into her home unharmed. According to testimony at a two-day preliminary hearing, the girl overheard White say to Owens, Go in the house (after her). The men then fled. Deputy District Attorney Dan Owens alleged that days earlier, Owens had talked to a friend about grabbing a girl. White was arrested two days after the alleged assault, after a witness reported seeing a pickup truck matching the description of the one used by the suspects. Owens was arrested several hours later in Escondido. In addition to attempted kidnapping for rape, the defendants are charged with assault with intent to commit rape, contact with a minor with the intent of committing a sexual offense and false imprisonment.Judge Robert Kearney – saying the defendants would pose a threat if released – ordered them held without bail.

1079,"Three Los Angeles County men wanted in connection with a series of robberies and raoes throughout the Bay Area and a murder in San Jose in late September were arrested last week, San Jose police said today. An Yan, 28, of Baldwin Park, Lin Tao, 27, of Monterey Park and Panpan Huang, 36, of Chino, were arrested at their homes by the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department all on suspicion of murder, assault with a deadly weapon, conspiracy, robbery, kidnapping and sexual assault, according to police. The three have been connected to at least four separate crimes at alleged brothels between Sept. 27 and Sept. 28, detectives with the San Jose, Milpitas, Fremont and South San Francisco police departments discovered. The men are accused of murdering Xingjian Li of San Gabriel on Sept. 28 just after 8:40 p.m. in the 300 block of Elan Village Lane in San Jose, according to police. The location was operating as a brothel, police said. Responding officers found Li was suffering from at least one gunshot. He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Prior to the murder, the men allegedly sexually assaulted three women during separate robberies at other brothels in Milpitas, Fremont and South San Francisco. The first alleged crime occurred on Sept. 27 and was initially reported as a suspicious circumstance in the 500 block of Murphy Ranch Road in Milpitas at 10:26 a.m. There, officers encountered a female victim who said she had been robbed and sexually assaulted. A few hours later, another female victim was allegedly robbed and sexually assaulted in the 100 block of McLellan Drive in South San Francisco. That victim, however, didnt report the incident until two days later. Hours before the Sept. 28 murder in San Jose, police in Fremont responded to a home invasion robbery at a undisclosed location. Three women said they were robbed at gunpoint and one reported being sexually assaulted. Police today said a follow-up investigation indicated that there could be additional victims of similar crimes. Police are looking for two more suspects in the series of crimes. The first suspect is described as a Chinese man, age 25 to 30 years old, between 5 feet 10 inches and 5 feet 11 inches tall, weighing between 160 and 170 pounds. He had a shaved head and was last seen wearing a school varsity-type blue jacket with tan sleeves. The second suspect is also described as a Chinese man, between 35 and 38 years old, 6 feet 2 inches tall, weighing 250 pounds with black, straight medium-length hair. He was last seen wearing black aviator sunglasses, a black T-shirt, black shorts and black tennis shoes. Police have released surveillance images of the two outstanding suspects in hopes that someone may be able to identify them.

Raul Martinez or Detective Brian Meeker at (408) 277-5283. Those wishing to remain anonymous can call (408) 947-7867. Bay City News",1
1080,"Follow Burnsville Patch on Twitter | Like us on Facebook | Sign up for our daily newsletter Savage police have completed their investigation into the case of whose story went viral last week after it was reported he was possibly taken from his yard on July 25 and then returned, beaten. Their conclusion – based on investigation, veterinary reports and interviews with Cesars owner, Robert Cole, Coles fiance, Amber Wade, and numerous neighbors – is that the dog was accidentally hit by a car after he escaped from his fenced yard. Police reports obtained by Patch reveal that since the incident was reported July 25, police have spoken to several neighbors who said they saw the dogs running loose that day. One neighbor said she received a call that day informing her that the dogs were running loose and said the dogs run loose quite often and the neighbors will call each other to let them know. One resident was quoted as saying a pit bull and black lab were bolting down the street on July 25. Police said they saw bloody paw prints indicating Cesar had crossed a busy street near the area of 133rd and 134th Street, several blocks from the dogs home on the 5400 block of West 132nd Lane. The dogs owner, Robert Cole, has also been cited by the city of Savage related to letting his dogs run loose. In April, a resident called and reported a pit bull and black lab running loose in the neighborhood and trying to get at other dogs in fenced areas, according to police reports. When police found Coles dog did not have a license, he was given a week to get a license for the dog and was cited when he failed to do so, records said. Cole also has a warrant out for his arrest for an unpaid fine related in connection with that incident, court records said. Cole was informed of the warrant last week after Cesars incident and given until the end of the day Monday to clear it up with Scott County court officials. Although a vet at Midwest Animal Rescue and Services (MARS) told police Cesars injuries likely did not come from a vehicle because no debris was found in his wounds, that vet did not do x-rays or treat Cesar for his wounds, police records show. Cesar was transported to Douglas Animal Hospital, where he was treated. That report from a vet states that the injury on Cesars right hind leg was a result of severe trauma. Cesar also had a 1 cm deep laceration on his left leg and an abrasion on his chin. The report also stated, lung musculoskeletal and degloving most consistent with trauma from hit by car, and/or dragging. Lung changes consistent with trauma, suspect hit by car. The report also says that gravel was found in and removed from Cesars injuries. The writing on Cesars back stating, Back Off Bob remains unexplained, police said. In a police interview with Cole, who was not home at the time the dogs disappeared, he said he would have been upset with his fiance if he found out the dogs had gotten loose and Cesar had been hit by a car. Coles fiance, Amber Wade, quietly responded no when asked by police if she wrote on the dog in an interview on July 27. Cole also told police that Cesar is too shy to have gone with a stranger in an abduction scenario and that although hes involved in legal issues with an ex-business partner in a dog-training business, he didnt think it was likely that anyone from that business happened upon the escaped dog to do him harm. Police have closed the case, saying there is no evidence to support Cesar was adbucted and injured in any manner other than accidental. At last count, MARS issued a statement . After conducting our own internal investigation, we have determined that based on the medical records and pictures that are available...we cannot conclusively determine what truly happened to Cesar. However, with our experience and that of an experienced veterinarian, it is our opinion that his injuries are not consistent with an automobile impact. As we are not professional investigators, it is not in our ability to draw a clear and final evaluation. We are leaving any criminal investigation to the Savage Police Department...We are confident that the injuries inflicted on Cesar were at the hand of a human, whether it be by a steering wheel or a weapon. The message was posted on the animal rescue groups Facebook page on Saturday. Since then, MARS has issued no further statements about the case. Apparently, the organization is still collecting funds for the dogs recovery, a process that began shortly after the initial story of torture went viral on the web, eliciting a wave of sympathy from the public.",0

The suspect was described by the store owner and the employee as a Hispanic male (57, 120 lbs.) between the ages of 15-20 wearing a hoodie, black pants,  a white T-shirt with the word Obey defined in red, and black tennis shoes with white bottoms.

In her statement to police, Yoo said the suspect repeatedly threatened to kill her. The suspect had her tell Coffee to stay in the restroom. Then he instructed Yoo to ask Coffee to come out slowly with her hands up and get down on the floor. He ordered Coffee to tie Yoo up with a curling iron cord that was on the floor. Coffee began to reach for the cord, then stopped and told the suspect she would give him all the money in the register if he wouldnt hurt Yoo. Coffee stood up and started getting money out of the cash register. Coffee informed police she fanned the money out in her hand, but then a customer entered the store.

Investigators said the victim claimed that the man who she said is her pimp kidnapped her in Ohio . He snatched her and put her in the car and said, Now, you work for me, Kathryn Griffin a peer recovery coach specialist for the Harris County Sheriffs Office told KTRK. This is probably the saddest scenario I have come across in my 14 years of dealing with the human sex trafficking.

Police allege that Michael J. Purpura, 36, attacked and tried to abduct a 10-year-old girl in Winchester. The incident took place on Saturday, one day before Purpura was taken into custody for allegedly forcing a woman into her apartment before raping her last week. Just before 4:30 p.m., Winchester Police responded to Skillings Field by the walk through tunnel for a report of an assault on a child. Upon arrival, the child reported that she was approached by a white male with scruffy facial hair. The suspect allegedly asked the girl if she knew what time it was and she said she did not know. The suspect then walked away through the tunnel toward Spruce Street, but reappeared a short time later while the girl was walking through the tunnel and placed his hand over her mouth and picked her up off of the ground, police say. The girl kicked, tried to yell and was eventually able to get away from the man. She ran out onto the field and approached a group of adults and told them about the incident, who then called police and the girls parents. Police conducted a thorough search of the area, but were unable to locate the suspect. An investigation was launched, and footage was taken from multiple surveillance cameras. The investigation quickly pointed to the suspect. Police say it appears to be an isolated incident, and no other types of incidents like have been reported in the region. This is a very disturbing case in which a man allegedly attacked a young girl, Chief Albertelli said. Our detectives worked aggressively and diligently to put together a case, and I am grateful that this appears to be an isolated incident. I also want to recognize the victim in this case. Despite a terrible trauma and attempted abduction, this young girl had the presence of mind to fight off her attacker and immediately report what had happened to a group of adults.

1090,"The Rose City is home to three registered sex offenders, according to the Morris County Prosecutors Office. Through an Open Public Records Act request, Patch obtained town-by-town statistics regarding the number of registered sex offenders residing in each Morris County municipality, now 20 years after a landmark bill was signed into law. The county, with a total of 292 registered sex offenders, is led by Dover with 41.  Madison can be found slightly below the midway point in the county with three registered sex offenders among its population of more than 16,270. Numbers varied by county throughout the state, with Essex leading all 21 counties claiming 522 registered sex offenders as residents. Morris County is in the top half of the states counties, ranking fifth overall. According to the New Jersey State Police, Hunterdon County has the least number of registered sex offenders with just 27. On Oct. 31, 1994, sex offender registration and community notification provisions were signed into law under the name of Megans Law. Less than seven years later, on July 23, 2001, that law expanded and became required for registration on the Internet as well. Megans Law came about after Megan Kanka, a seven-year-old girl, was raped and murdered by a neighbor in Hamilton Township, Mercer County in July of 1994. That neighbor, Jesse Timmendequas, was previously convicted of sexually assaulting a five-year-old girl and seven-year-old girl. Timmendequas was convicted of first degree murder, kidnapping, and four aggravated sexual assault crimes of Kanka. He was sentenced to the death penalty, but reverted back to life in prison without parole after New Jersey abolished the death penalty in 2007 while he sat on death row. In Morris County the list of each towns number of registered sex offenders is as follows: Dover: 41Parsippany: 22Mount Olive: 19Morristown: 19Roxbury: 17Jefferson: 16Rockaway Township: 16Rockaway Borough: 14Butler: 11Boonton: 10Denville: 9Montville: 9Mount Arlington: 8Morris Township: 8Lincoln Park: 8Hanover: 7Washington Township: 6Greystone Park: 5Wharton: 5Randolph: 4Kinnelon: 4East Hanover: 4Florham Park: 3Madison: 3Mendham Township: 3Netcong: 3Pequannock: 3Boonton Township: 2Chatham Borough: 2Chatham Township: 2Chester Township: 2Long Hill Township: 2Victory Gardens: 2Riverdale: 1Chester Borough: 0Harding: 0Mendham Borough: 0Morris Plains: 0Mountain Lakes: 0 Registration under Megans Law comes from convictions under a wide scope of crimes, according to the New Jersey State Police. Also, those not found guilty by reason of insanity are also required to register. The crimes include aggravated sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, kidnapping in conjunction with a sex crime, endangering the welfare of a child by engaging in sexual conduct, luring or enticing, and knowingly promoting prostitution of a child. Megans Law is similarly known at the federal level as the Sexual Offender Act, which was created in 1994, and requires anyone convicted of a sex crime against children to notify local law enforcement of any change of address or employment after release from custody.",1

1095,"Prosecutors say Uber drivers convicted of murder, sexual assault, driving under the influence and other felonies passed Ubers industry-leading background checks. Since the filing of the original complaint eight months ago, the Los Angeles and San Francisco district attorneys offices have received records of Uber drivers who were issued citations by airport police at San Francisco and Los Angeles International Airports and by the Los Angeles Police Departments Bandit Cab detail. These records, while representing only a small sample of citations issued to Uber drivers, uncovered more than 25 Uber drivers who had criminal records or driving records that disqualified them from driving for Uber. These Uber drivers nonetheless passed Ubers background check, according to an amended complaint filed jointly by the San Francisco and Los Angeles District Attorneys Office against the San Francisco-based ride service company on Tuesday. The criminal histories of these drivers include convictions for murder, sex offenses, kidnapping, assault, robbery, burglary, fraud, and identity theft. Driving records include convictions for driving under the influence, driving with a suspended license, and reckless driving, as well as drivers with more than three DMV points within the preceding three years, according to the complaint. The amended complaint against Uber alleges that the company allows drivers with disqualifying criminal histories to pass Ubers background check and that Ubers background check process fails to uncover many categories of sex offenders. The complaint further alleges that Uber has misled consumers online and is making untrue or misleading representations regarding the measures it takes to ensure customer safety in order to induce people to get into a strangers car, among other allegations. Uber is valued around $50 billion by investors for its services providing prearranged transportation for compensation using an online-enabled smartphone application to connect passengers with drivers. Last year Uber maintained that at their company Every ridesharing and livery driver in the U.S. is thoroughly screened through a process that includes county, federal, and multi-state criminal background checks that go back as far as the drivers states law allows, and ongoing reviews of drivers motor vehicle records throughout their time driving with Uber, according to the complaint. That language has since been watered down, with todays online version omitting claims such as thoroughly screened and criminal background checks that go back as far as the drivers states law allows. Joe Sullivan, Ubers chief security officer, has previously stated that the background checks consist of running an applicants name and address through databases identified as the National Sex Offender Registry, National Criminal Search, and several different databases used to flag suspected terrorists, according to the complaint. Ubers statements that it searches the National Sex Offender Registry are false, according to the complaint, because that particular database is available only to law-enforcement personnel. Uber uses the National Sex Offender Public Website, which does not detect registered sex offenders such as certain California offenders convicted of child pornography offenses where the victims are between the ages of 16 and 18, sexual exploitation of a child, employment of a minor for sexual exploitation, misdemeanor child molestation, felony sexual battery, and sex offenses against a grandchild, child, stepchild or sibling not involving penetration. The amended complaint states that Ubers misleading representations present a special danger to public safety as more and more parents are allowing their teenage children to ride in Uber vehicles unaccompanied. Ubers false and misleading statements are so woven into the fabric of Ubers safety narrative that they render Ubers entire safety message misleading, the complaint alleges. Some of the most alarming records uncovered during the discovery period was an Uber driver who was convicted of second-degree murder in Los Angeles in 1982, an Uber Driver who was convicted of committing lewd or lascivious acts against a child under 14 in 1999 and an Uber Driver who was convicted of sexual exploitation of children in Wyoming in 2005. Other drivers have been convicted of kidnapping for ransom with a firearm, identity theft, and burglary while many more have been convicted of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to the amended complaint. The complaint states that these systemic failures with Ubers background checks even allowed serious and violent felony convictions to go completely unnoticed by the company. --Bay City News",1

1098,"HERNANDO, Fla. — A determined mother and an off-duty deputy are getting the credit for saving a 13-year-old girl from a would-be abductor Tuesday morning. According to the Citrus County Sheriffs Office, the incident unfolded just before noon at the 2560 N. Trucks Ave. Dollar General store in Hernando. Deputies say a man inside the store grabbed a 13-year-old, petite female who was shopping with her mother. As the man tried to run out of the store with the girl in his arms, the mother caught him and grabbed onto her daughter, an email from the sheriffs office said. A tug-of-war between the two erupted with the sound of screaming audible throughout the store. The mother hung onto the child for dear life as the man kept attempting to pull her away, store surveillance video showed. After making such a commotion, the man let go of the child and ran out of the store, the email said. As fate would have it, off-duty Deputy Jonathan Behnen just happened to pull up in his cruiser right around that time. Behnen had been to court earlier in the morning and had stopped at the store to grab supplies when he encountered the running suspect, the sheriffs office explained. The stores manager alerted Behnen to the attempted kidnapping, sparking the deputy to spring into action, the agency reported. Behnen quickly pulled his patrol car in front of the mans vehicle as he was trying to leave the parking lot. Behen then got out of his cruiser, pulled his gun and ordered the man out of his car, the email said. Craig Bonello, 30, was brought into custody and charged with one count of kidnapping and one count of child abuse, the agency noted. In my 10 years on the road I have never seen anything like this, Sgt. Craig Callahan said from the scene. He truly intended to abduct this child right in front of everyone in the store. Deputies say the mother and daughter were not injured in the attack, but they were rattled. Their names are not being released. As for Behnen, he is a bona fide hero today, said Capt. Ricky Grant. If it werent for him, this guy would have gotten away. Bonello, as it turned out, was no stranger to the Citrus County Sheriffs Office. He was last arrested in February on trespassing charges, the agency said. Hes also been arrested on a number of misdemeanor charges in the past and a 2009 aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer charge. Bonellos intentions with the child remain unknown, the agency noted in its email. This was a chaotic scene with a lot at stake, said Commander Buddy Grant. Thank goodness the girls mother jumped into action to prevent this man from kidnapping her daughter. Bunello was being held without bond in the Citrus County Jail Wednesday.

1101,"A 24-7 search was underway today for three dangerous prisoners who escaped the Orange County jail lockup in Santa Ana. Inmate Hossein Nayeri of Newport Beach, 37, faced charges of kidnapping and torture; Jonathan Tieu of Fountain Valley, 20, faced a murder charge; and Bac Duong of Santa Ana, 43, faced an attempted murder charge. None of the escapees had been convicted. The inmates last were seen at a physical body count that took place 5 a.m. Friday at the Mens Central Jail complex but were not discovered missing until about 9 p.m., after the days second and final body count, sheriffs Lt. Jeff Hallock said at an afternoon news conference outside the jail. Investigators believe they used an altercation that happened at the jail as the body count approached at 8 p.m. Friday as cover for their escape, which was well thought out and possibly the result of weeks or even months of planning, Hallock said. The men escaped from a dormitory-style tank housing about 65 inmates. The jail complex -- which dates to 1968 and lacks some self-contained services that are features of more modern jails and prisons -- consists of three facilities housing about 900 inmates, according to the lieutenant. The entire complex is maximum security. There have been two prior escapes from the jail, both more than 20 years ago, Hallock said. The escapees cut through 1/2-inch steel bars and plumbing tunnels to make their way to an unsecured portion of the jails roof before using a makeshift cloth rope to rappel to the ground. They fled area on foot, Hallock said. Its unclear if they had any help from the outside or if other inmates were involved in the escape. The sheriffs department, Orange County District Attorneys Office and Probation Department, the U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI are involved in the search, which, Hallock called a 24-7 operation until these three individuals are caught. The FBI has offered a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to the escapees arrests, Hallock said. Once the men were discovered to be missing, investigating agencies that handled the escapees cases, as well as the D.A.s office, were notified and steps were taken to protect those involved, Hallock said. As sheriff, my utmost concern and primary responsibility is the safety of each Orange County resident, according to a statement from Sheriff Sandra Hutchens. I take this situation very seriously and the men and women of the Orange County Sheriffs Department will not rest until all three men are captured. The three men should be considered dangerous, based on the crimes of which they are accused, but authorities had no specific information indicating they were armed, Hallock said. Anyone who sees them should call 911 immediately and anyone with information regarding their possible whereabouts was urged to call a special hotline at (714) 628-7085. Anonymous tips can be provided by calling Orange County Crime Stoppers at (855) TIP-OCCS. --City News Service, photo courtesy of the OCSD.",1
1102,"SAN DIEGO, CA: An ex-con accused of repeatedly raping a woman during a 2 1/2-hour ordeal near Balboa Park and trying to kidnap another woman the same night pleaded not guilty Wednesday to more than a dozen felony charges and was ordered to remain in custody in lieu of $5 million bail. Ismael Hernandez Jr., 27, is charged with 13 felonies, including four counts of forcible rape and three counts of forcible oral copulation, in connection with the crimes he allegedly committed Thursday night. This appeared to be a random attack where the defendant tried to kidnap a woman at knifepoint, Deputy District Attorney Judy Taschner told reporters after the defendant made his initial court appearance before Judge Charles Gill. She managed to get away. Taschner alleged that the Chula Vista man accosted a second woman, made threats and directed her to an area near Sixth Avenue and Cedar Street, at the south end of Balboa Park. That is where he forced her to commit numerous sexual acts, before moving her to a second location, where he forced more sex acts, Taschner alleged. She said the second round of sexual assaults took place in the 1600 block of Ninth Avenue. The woman who was nearly kidnapped told police she was approaching her car carrying take-out food from a nearby restaurant when she noticed a man in the reflection of her car window approaching her from behind. The suspect made statements to the woman that she was going to be victimized, and she threw her food toward him and ran back into a building from where she came. Her boyfriend responded, and the couple looked for the suspect, but they did not call police at the time. It wasnt until news of the sexual assault became public that they came forward. Taschner said the two strong and courageous women recalled details of the assailants face and tattoos. A police flier based on their description generated numerous tips that led to the arrest of Hernandez, the prosecutor said. In addition to forcible rape and oral copulation counts, he is charged with attempted kidnapping, three counts of sexual battery by restraint and two counts of sexual penetration by force, along with allegations that the alleged crimes took place during a kidnapping and with the use of a deadly weapon, which would substantially increase the penalty if the defendant is convicted. The judge also ordered Hernandez to stay away from the victims. He scheduled a readiness conference for May 20 and a preliminary hearing for May 24. — By James R. Riffel, City News Service",0

Eisenhauer pleaded no contest in February after prosecutors presented a weeks worth of evidence against him, including that Lovells blood was found in his car and his DNA was discovered under her fingernails, The Washington Post reported. He faced a sentence of up to life plus 15 years for the convictions on counts of first-degree murder, abduction and concealing a dead body, according to the Post. Both parents of the seventh-grade girl testified at sentencing Tuesday that they had suffered immeasurable grief, the Associated Press reported. A Virginia judge ordered Eisenhauer to 50 years in prison and 25 years of supervised probation. Officials suspected Lovell had an inappropriate relationship with Eisenhauer, who was 18 at the time and allegedly killed the girl to keep her from revealing the nature of their connection. A friend of Nicole Lovell attributed the teens online activities as a way to cope with bullying at school. She was looking for someone who would give her attention and give her some compassion, Lovells 13-year-old classmate told The Washington Post, noting kids bullied her because of a scar on her throat from a tracheotomy. The medical examiner reportedly found that of the 14 stab wounds the teen suffered, the fatal one was to her neck. While social media may have introduced Lovell and Eisenhauer, it also helped law enforcement close in on the suspects. The day before Lovell died—on Tuesday, Jan. 26—she went sledding with a pair of twins in her neighborhood and showed them a picture of David, the mother of the 8-year-olds told the Associated Press. Lovell allegedly told the twins she would be sneaking out to see David that night and shared with the 8-year-olds messages they exchanged on the app Kik, which reportedly helped lead police to Eisenhauer. Natalie Keepers, 21, of Laurel, will begin trial Sept. 17 for concealing a body and acting as an accessory, according to the Roanoke Times. She and Eisenhauer were classmates at Virginia Tech. Both Eisenhauer and Keepers hailed from Howard County and were studying engineering at Virginia Tech at the time of the murder. Eisenhauer attended Wilde Lake High School and was a star track athlete. In 2015, he was named the Howard County boys indoor track athlete of the year. He was listed as a long distance runner on Virginia Techs track and field team until his bio was removed following his arrest. Keepers attended Hammond High School, interned at NASA and wanted to pursue a career in aerospace engineering, according to The Washington Post. Pictured, David E. Eisenhauer.

1111,"Submitted by the Aurora Police Department After receiving numerous leads through social media, Aurora Police have located and interviewed a man wanted for questioning in what was thought to be the attempted abduction of a 13-year-old girl on July 2. That interview, along with a thorough review of surveillance video, has resulted in detectives concluding that the 20-year-old Aurora man had no criminal intent and will not be charged.  Aurora Police released a photograph of the man they were seeking on July 22.  The incident occurred at about 11:30 a.m., July 2, in the area of New York and Union Streets. The 13-year-old girl said that she was walking in that area when the man, who was driving an older model, blue, four-door vehicle stopped alongside her. He tried to initiate a conversation with the girl which alarmed her so she ran into a McDonalds and took a seat by a family. It was originally thought that the man ran after the girl into the restaurant and may have been deterred after seeing the girl with the family so he left.  Police said however, that while the actions described by the 13 year old were confirmed by the alleged offender — and she was rightfully upset by those actions — it is clear that he believed her to be older and had no intentions of abducting or harming her.  Police also believe that the case is not linked to another attempted abduction in the same general area that occurred on July 13. That incident remains under investigation and involves a 15-year-old girl who said that at around 10:05 p.m., a man approached her in the area of Root and New York Streets after getting out of a dark-colored vehicle. The man tried to initiate a conversation with her and offered her a ride but the girl ignored him. As she was walking away, the girl said the man grabbed her but let her go when she began to scream. The suspect ran to his vehicle, which was parked on East Park Place, and fled the area.  The victim described the man as Hispanic, 20 to 25 years old, 5 ft. 10 in., 180 pounds and wearing a black and brown t-shirt with a yellow reflective vest, similar to a construction vest, over the t-shirt. He also had on dirty blue jeans and tan work boots. She said his vehicle was late model, possibly green, and was similar to a Honda Civic or Accord.

1114,"A Phoenix woman is going to prison and an Orange County woman has been completely exonerated after a bizarre love triangle and identity theft ended in a faked sexual assault and a false arrest. After leaving a relationship with a U.S. Marshal identified only as John Doe, Michelle Suzanne Hadley became the unwitting target of his next girlfriend, Angela Maria Diaz, a woman whom she had never met. According to prosecutors, Diaz used sophisticated computer software to spoof emails and make it appear Hadley was posting online classified ads encouraging men to sexually assault her. Diaz staged an attempted sexual assault on herself in which she had red marks on her neck and breast, prompting police to arrest Hadley, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told reporters. At some point during the investigation, as authorities were seeking computer addresses for the origin of those emails, they began to suspect Diaz was framing Hadley, Deputy District Attorney Rick Zimmer said. From what were seeing, shes a serial con artist, Zimmer alleged. She duped us. It was very sophisticated, well thought-out and took a great deal of planning. On Tuesday, Diaz pleaded guilty to kidnapping, false imprisonment by menace, fraud or deceit, forgery, possession of a forged check over $950, perjury and grand theft, as well as misdemeanors of falsely reporting a crime to a police agency and falsely reporting a crime to a peace officer. Diaz was sentenced to serve five years in state prison for those crimes. It is said that true life is stranger than fiction, and the facts of this case make that statement spot on, Rackauckas said. As important as the filing of the charges against Angela Maria Diaz, the dismissal of charges against Michelle Suzanne Hadley is equally important. Investigators followed the leads and learned of the deception Diaz used that led to Hadleys false arrest. Hadley maintained her innocence while Diaz stole her identity and sent threatening emails to herself. On Tuesday Diaz admitted guilt to filing false reports with the Anaheim Police Department, claiming that men arrived at her residence eager to engage in rape fantasy solicitations she said they had learned about through Hadley had posted on Craigslist. None of it was true, according to Tony Rackauckas. It is one of the strangest social media harassment cases to cross the wires to date. Hadley, a 30-year-old Orange County woman, was wrongfully imprisoned for several months in the summer of 2016, according to the Orange County District Attorneys office, who removed all charges against her in January. I want to make sure that Miss Hadley is cleared in every possible way, in the courtroom and in the court of public opinion, in the media and in cyberspace. Miss Hadley is the innocent victim of a diabolical scheme, Rackauckas said. It was well into the investigation against Hadley that detectives realized Diazs story didnt add up. At some point during the investigation, as authorities were seeking computer addresses for the origin of those emails, they began to suspect Diaz was framing Hadley, Deputy District Attorney Rick Zimmer said. Diaz is also accused of doctoring a paycheck to add $2,000, an alleged crime uncovered during the investigation. Diaz is additionally accused of faking cervical cancer, masquerading as an attorney, forging doctors notes, faking a pregnancy and posing as two ex-girlfriends of her estranged husband, prosecutors said. Read: Serial Con Artist Framed Romantic Rival In Elaborate Scheme: OCDA If not for the hard work of law enforcement continuing to investigate and seek the truth in this case, Ms. Hadley could have continued to face life in prison. It is unfathomable why Ms. Diaz would concoct such a diabolical scheme to hurt an innocent person, said Rackauckas. Even while pleading guilty, Diaz showed no remorse, compassion, or empathy for the victim. We hope the resolution of this case brings some closure to Ms. Hadley so she can move forward in her life.

1115,"Kidnapping, robbery and other charges were filed in San Diego against a man accused of abducting a batting coach and his teenage student last week at Hickman Field in Kearny Mesa, then committing a carjacking to make his getaway, a prosecutor said Wednesday. Ira Stringer, 45, was arrested in Orange County Saturday following a high-speed chase. He was charged in that county with robbery, kidnapping and evading police and will be prosecuted there before facing charges in San Diego, said Deputy District Attorney Jim Koerber. Stringer was taken into custody in the city of Orange on Saturday after fleeing from a Circle K gas station he allegedly robbed, according to San Diego police. The defendant allegedly admitted to the double kidnapping in Kearny Mesa when he was interviewed by SDPD detectives, and also allegedly admitted to robbing a mini-market in Lemon Grove before making his way to Orange County. The coach and teenage boy were kidnapped the morning of Dec. 23 from the Hickman Field ballpark at 5100 Hickman Field Drive. Stringer allegedly approached them and asked for a cigarette. When the coach and teen declined, Stringer allegedly threatened them with a silver revolver and ordered them both into the coachs car. Stringer allegedly ordered the coach to drive them to Ramona, with the teen in the passenger seat and Stringer in the back seat with his gun pointed at the victims. Stringer allegedly took the coachs cell phone and pretended to have a conversation with another person who appeared to be in on the heist, according to San Diego police. The coach allegedly tried to take the gun from Stringer and a fight ensued, causing the coach to lose control of the car and crash into another vehicle near San Vincente and Warnock roads in Ramona. The gun went off twice during the struggle, striking the roof of the car, according to the SDPD. Immediately after the crash, the teen got out of the car and ran to a passing motorist to ask for help. The good Samaritan took the boy to the Ramona sheriffs station. The victims told deputies that after the crash, the kidnapping suspect carjacked an elderly woman who tried to help them. Stringer is scheduled to be in court Jan. 11 for a preliminary hearing in Orange County. --City News Service; Photo via Screenshot of video from KGTV10, posted above.",1

1128,"Submitted by the Cook County Sheriffs Office. Photo via shutterstock. Cook County, IL - The Illinois Department of Children & Family Services is joining forces with the Cook County Sheriffs Office in a landmark mission to locate and save runaway state wards, who are particularly vulnerable to crime and trafficking. As part of a two-year pilot project, the Sheriffs Office and DCFS will combine resources to broaden the impact of an existing specialized Sheriffs unit dedicated to recovering missing or runaway wards. Since its formation in October 2012, this Sheriffs unit has made more than 520 juvenile rescues. The cross-agency unit will be comprised of seven sworn Sheriffs officers with specialized training in juvenile justice as well as three DCFS child welfare specialists. The collaborative team, commanded by the Sheriffs office, will be officially rebranded as the Child Rescue Unit (CRU). DCFS will fund four of the Sheriff Office positions within the Child Rescue Unit at a cost of about $400,000 a year. Through this coordination, the enhanced Child Rescue Unit will be more than a sum of its parts. The DCFS child welfare specialists will bring accurate long-term data on the custodial history of the missing children, along with working relationships with group homes and foster parents, making it significantly easier to locate and recover missing children. The Sheriffs Office brings investigative expertise, a history of success in rescuing runaway juveniles, and a day-to-day connection to the communities to which missing wards often run. The Sheriffs Office made over 100 juvenile rescues in 2015 alone, but with these added resources the augmented Child Rescue Unit is aiming to more than double that number in 2016. The underpinning of this partnership dates back to December 2012, when Sheriff Dart demanded a state audit into the rules and compliance of previous DCFS regimes with regards to the handling of missing and abducted children. The results of the audit, made public in December 2014, revealed that the previous DCFS regimes often failed to report missing wards in a timely manner – and sometimes the runaway children were not being reported missing at all, making it impossible to find these vulnerable children. When a ward of the state goes on the run, the stakes are high and time is of the essence. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children reports one in six endangered runways in America to be likely sex trafficking victims. At any given time, there are 100 open child protection warrants in Cook County. When George Sheldon began his stewardship of DCFS in February 2015, one of his first calls was to Sheriff Dart to propose working together in an effort to correct this glaring problem. Its an open secret that both drug traffickers and sex traffickers seek to prey on runaway wards of the state. The government, which is effectively their parent, must prioritize finding these children as quickly and safely as possible, said Sheriff Dart. Ive been impressed by Director Sheldons dedication to turning DCFS around and couldnt be happier to collaborate with him. Simply put, this partnership will save lives. The state of Illinois is the legal guardian for more than 16,400 youth across the state. On any given day, more than 200 of these youth, approximately half from Cook County, are reported missing or on run. In response to the Auditor Generals findings, in 2015, DCFS revised and strengthened its rules and procedures for missing youth and pledged to continue to find ways to reduce the number of missing youth. The very nature of child welfare is that of collaboration - working with government agencies, law enforcement, the courts and others to ensure the safety and well-being of children, said George H. Sheldon, Acting Director of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. So following the findings of the Auditor General and changes to our internal procedures, partnering with Sheriff Dart was a logical next step to address the issue of missing youth. By joining forces well be able to bring the expertise and experience of professionals from both departments together to quickly and efficiently locate and return our missing youth.",0

Noah Winchester, 31, was arrested near his Stockton home Thursday morning and was booked into jail on $3.1 million bail, according to the district attorneys office. He remains in jail and is scheduled to appear in court next week. The San Mateo Police Department released a statement Thursday saying that while it respects his presumption of innocence under the legal system, if proven true the allegations are a disgrace. We are horrified by the news of the recent arrest of this former San Mateo and Los Rios Community College District Police Officer, and want to assure our community and our leaders that this neither reflects nor deflects the dedication to duty and selfless service that our men and women commit themselves to every day on every contact, police said in the statement.

The charges include kidnapping with intent to commit rape, rape, sexual penetration and oral copulation under color of authority, battery, criminal threats, and forcible sex offenses. The investigation was opened in October and Winchester resigned in February. But news of the investigations into his conduct didnt surface publicly until May, when Wagstaffe and San Mateo police Chief Susan Manheimer revealed he was under investigation. The San Mateo County investigation into Winchester was opened on Oct. 20, when police in Burlingame responded to a distressed driver in the area of El Camino Real and Chapin Avenue at about 5:15 a.m. After contacting the driver, Burlingame police referred the report to San Mateo police for further investigation, according to Burlingame police records. The allegations had happened the previous night at about 10 p.m., San Mateo police said. While Manheimer said that as soon as the allegations against Winchester came to light she immediately suspended his police powers and contacted the district attorneys office, at the time Winchester was hired he was under investigation in Sacramento. Sacramento police opened a criminal investigation into Winchester in 2013, when he was a member of the Los Rios Community College District police force, according to Sacramento police Sgt. Bryce Heinlein. Winchester was briefly employed by the Sacramento Police Department in 2006 and 2007, but was released before his probationary period was up. Heinlein refused to provide more information about the Sacramento investigation into Winchester through a California Public Records Act request, citing the ongoing investigation. In 2015, another victim came forward to the Sacramento County Sheriffs Department regarding a 2013 incident, according to sheriffs spokesman Sgt. Tony Turnbull. Winchester served with the Los Rios Police Department from January 2009 to January 2015, according to district spokesman Mitchel Benson. He joined the San Mateo department early in 2015. Los Rios police Chief Cheryl Sears said in May that her department was cooperating with Wagstaffes investigation, though his office had only contacted the Los Rios department in May after news reports of Winchesters conduct had already surfaced. The American River Current published a statement issued on behalf of Los Rios Community College in May: The San Mateo Police Department received a separate report of possible sexual misconduct by on-duty officers last year when a man and woman reported that two officers, Faysal Abi-Chahine and Derrick Jarvis, pulled them over and searched them without cause on Aug. 26. Abi-Chahine allegedly groped the woman in the process, according to a lawsuit they filed in federal court in June. In a statement, San Mateo police said the department thoroughly investigated the allegations but didnt find sufficient evidence of misconduct by the officers. Both remain in good standing with the department. -Bay City News",1
1131,"A Columbia man pleaded no contest at the end of the first week of a murder trial in which he was charged with killing and concealing the death of a 13-year-old girl. David Eisenhauer, 20, a former Virginia Tech student and Wilde Lake High School grad, was accused of stabbing a Blacksburg Middle School student to death in 2016. He was suspected of having an inappropriate relationship with the girl. Nicole Madison Lovell, 13, disappeared from her familys apartment in Blacksburg, Virginia, on Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2016, and her remains were found three days later over the state line in Surry County, N.C. In the trial that began on Monday, prosecutors presented evidence that Lovells blood was found in Eisenhauers car and his DNA was discovered under her fingernails, The Washington Post reported. He could face a sentence of up to life plus 15 years now that he has been convicted of first-degree murder, abduction and concealing a dead body, according to the Post. Eisenhauer entered his plea on Friday, Feb. 9, in Montgomery County Circuit Court in Christiansburg, Virginia. Judge Robert Turk asked him if he was pleading no contest because he was guilty, and according to the Roanoke Times, he said: Yes. Eisenahuer will be sentenced in May. A sentencing hearing has been set for May 22 and is expected to last at least two days, the Roanoke Times reported. Natalie Keepers, 21, of Laurel, will begin trial Sept. 17 for concealing a body and acting as an accessory, according to the Times. She and Eisenhauer were classmates at Virginia Tech. Prosecutors previously said that in the case of Keepers, the charge of being an accessory before the fact to first-degree murder carries a term of 20 years to life in prison. Concealing a dead body is a felony carrying a maximum term of 10 years. Both Eisenhauer and Keepers hailed from Howard County and were studying engineering at Virginia Tech at the time of the murder. Eisenhauer attended Wilde Lake High School and was a star track athlete. In 2015, he was named the Howard County boys indoor track athlete of the year. He was listed as a long distance runner on Virginia Techs track and field team until his bio was removed following his arrest. Keepers attended Hammond High School, interned at NASA and wanted to pursue a career in aerospace engineering, according to The Washington Post. Pictured, David E. Eisenhauer.

1133,"Berkeley police say they are investigating a new report of an attempted kidnapping that occurred earlier this week, shortly before an incident on Sunday in which a man of the same description tried to lure three girls into a van. The most recently reported incident involving a girl walking alone occurred Sunday shortly before 6 p.m. in the area of College Avenue and Webster Street. The girl was approached by a suspect in a black full-sized cargo van with no side or rear windows, police said. The incident occurred about 15 minutes before one reported to police earlier this week, in which a suspect of the same description yelled at three girls walking in the area, demanding they get into his van. The man pursued the girls on foot when they ran away, police said, but ended his chase when they started to scream. He was last seen driving south on College Avenue. The suspect was described as a Hispanic male in his late 20s or early 30s with dark hair and a scruffy face, police said. The description of the suspect, his vehicle and the incident itself is similar to an episode that occurred the night of Sept. 18, near Willard Middle School. In that incident, two Willard Middle School students were walking on Telegraph Avenue, near Stuart Street, when a van pulled up next to them and a suspect told them to get inside, according to police. Like in Sundays incidents, the students refused and later reported it to authorities. Police are searching for any video surveillance from the area that might have captured the suspect and have increased patrols in the affected areas before and after school. Community members who see the suspect or any suspicious activity are asked to call 911 or (510) 981-5900 immediately. Those with other information are asked to call investigators at (510) 981-5715.

1136,"Manhattan prosecutors paid $536,940 to a celebrity psychiatrist who testified during the case of Etan Patz, the six-year-old boy who disappeared in SoHo in 1979, the New York Daily news reported. A jury found Pedro Hernandez guilty of kidnapping and killing Etan earlier this year, decades after the boys 1979 disappearance. Public records obtained by the Daily News show that the Manhattan district attorneys office paid $536,940 to Dr. Michael Welner, who provided expert testimony in the case arguing that Hernandez was not mentally ill. Hernandez, who was found guilty in a second trial this year after the first case ended in a mistrial, confessed to killing the boy, but offered different details and information about the crime in separate confessions. His lawyers argued that Hernandez was mentally ill, which made it difficult for him to distinguish reality from hallucinations. His words are not reliable, one of Hernandezs lawyers said during the trial. His words are not supported by other evidence. He is not guilty. (For more information on this and other neighborhood stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts.) Welner said he spent 18 hours interviewing Hernandez and more than 1,000 hours in total working on the case, according to the Daily News. I dont think he has any trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy, Welner said during the trial. Welner himself is a controversial figure in the world of forensic pathology. His firm, the Forensic Panel, has frequently provided testimony in some of the nations most high-profile criminal trials, including the trial of Brian David Mitchell, the man later convicted of kidnapping 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart in 2002. Welner defended his payment in an email to the Daily News. The case would have had a different outcome were I not to have contributed the necessary effort to it, he told the Daily News. Ask the parents of any murdered kid whether too much money was spent prosecuting their childs killer, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorneys office said in a statement to the Daily News. In this enormously complicated case, after a murder committed nearly 40 years ago, a jury unanimously concluded Pedro Hernandez was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Dr. Welner is an independent medical professional and we were very satisfied with the expert analysis he provided over the five-year period this case was in court.

All three are charged with aggravated murder and other crimes. Apache Hightower, 24, was found murdered in a rural part of Columbia County last month. The sheriffs office put out a notice labeling Jesse Lane - who her family has said is her ex-boyfriend - a person of interest. He was called armed and dangerous. He was found in September 29th in California where he was arrested on a parole violation. Lane was then returned to Oregon. Lane is charged with murder, kidnapping, hindering prosecution, and felon in possession of a firearm. Also indicted were Stephanie Toney, 20, and Charles Vernon, 29 - both of St. Helens. They are charged with murder, kidnapping, and hindering prosecution. Sheriff Dickerson praised his deputies. This incident is so sad for the needless loss of life and the tremendous sorrow for Ms. Hightowers family, said Dickerson, but I am extremely proud of the way investigators doggedly stayed on top of this case to produce this relatively quick result. Dickerson also thanked the numerous law enforcement agencies he said made the resolution of the case possible. He singled out: the Oregon Medical Examiners Office, the Oregon State Police Forensics Laboratory, the Portland Police Bureau, the United States Marshals fugitive task force, the FBI, the Jackson County District Attorneys Office, the Jackson County Sheriffs Office, the Oregon State Parole Board, the Columbia County Department of Community Justice, the Santa Barbara Police Department ,and the Santa Barbara County Sheriffs Office.

1139,"In 1984, Don Nichols kidnapped world-class biathlete Kari Swenson in the mountains near Big Sky, Montana and shot her would-be rescuer to death in an attack that garnered widespread media coverage and was later turned into a made-for-TV movie. Nichols, 86, who described himself as a mountain man was sentenced to 85 years in prison in the ordeal. But after being granted parole in April, Nichols was freed Wednesday after serving 32 years. He must report to a parole office in Great Falls, The Missoulian reported. Swenson, who was 22 at the time of the attack, said she was chained up during her ordeal and spotted her would-be rescuers before her abductors did. She yelled at them to leave because Nichols had threatened to shoot anyone who tried to help her. (For more information on the Swenson kidnapping and other Montana stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts.

Nichols son Dan apparently accidentally shot Swenson. She said she was left for dead with a sucking chest wound for hours as Goldsteins body lay nearby. Don and Dan Nichols fled and were arrested five months later after a manhunt in the mountains of southwestern Montana. During the parole hearing in April, board members noted Nichols clean record in his more than 30 years in prison and his completion of educational programs, including anger management and life skills. Don Nichols, who kidnapped Swenson to be a bride for his then 19-year-old son, told the board members they would not regret their decision and he felt bad about his crimes.  Before Don Nichols 2012 parole hearing, Kari Swenson wrote a letter to The Bozeman Daily Chronicle calling the father and son crazy misfits who chose to live apart from society and defy its laws. I endured being grabbed by both wrists, hit in the face, thrown to the ground, chained to Dan, threatened with knives and guns, marched through the woods, secured like an animal to trees and spent a terrifying night chained next to Dan, she wrote. She said she spent years in counseling and still has shrapnel in her chest that hurts her and brings back haunting memories of the ordeal that ended her athletic career. Dan Nichols was convicted of kidnapping and assault and was released from prison in 1991. The case was the subject of a 1987 made-for-TV movie The Abduction of Kari Swenson, starring Tracy Pollan.

1150,"- Charlotte police have arrested a man they say is behind two sexual assaults of local teenagers in cases dating back to 1988 and 1994. Those cases had grown cold until a recent federal grant for rape kit DNA testing provided authorities new leads. Charlotte has a backlog of more than 800 sexual assault kits that have either only been partially tested or not processed at all, The Charlotte Observer reported recently. While occurring six years apart, the two sexual assault cases were similar, according to police reports. A 16-year-old female walking home along the 8500 block of Nations Ford Road when she was followed by a man, who then pulled her into a vacant apartment and sexually assaulted her. In April of 1994, also late at night, a 17-year-old woman was walking home in the 1900 block of West Boulevard when a man began walking with her before he sexually assaulted her in a wooded area. In both cases, the victims were treated at hospitals and evidence was collected. That DNA evidence, however, wasnt tested until 2017, when Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police received a federal grant for testing, according to the police report. DNA evidence confirmed Zellie Edwards as the suspect in both cases, CMPD said in a statement announcing the arrest. Charlotte police located Edwards, 49, and arrested him without incident Feb. 8, and following an interview at police headquarters, charged him with two counts of 2nd degree rape and one count of 2nd degree kidnapping. In 2006, CMPD launched a Sexual Assault Cold Case Unit to review 2,886 cases, and reports fewer than 10 percent of those cases have been resolved. Of those cases, 260 have been cleared, 80 of which were cleared by arrest, 177 were exceptionally cleared and 3 have been unfounded, CMPD said Wednesday. In October 2017, CMPD received a Department of Justice grant of $837,342 aimed at getting Charlotte caught up with DNA testing, the Observer reported. In addition to testing, the grant paid for two new laptops for sexual assault detectives, as well as the hiring of a part-time researcher.

Jasmine is glad to be free and wants to go home, Price said. She said they have arranged for her to get medical treatment at Stanford University when they return. Abuslin went to a Florida rehabilitation facility last month with the assistance of the Richmond Police Department but was swiftly arrested for allegedly assaulting a guard and was jailed for the last 17 days on $300,000 bail, rankling Alameda County prosecutors because of her key role in bringing the charges against the seven officers. Price said that Abuslin is not a drug addict and accused the Richmond Police Department of sending her to the Florida facility under false pretenses, potentially tampering with a witness. Richmond police interim Chief Allwyn Brown said in a report issued earlier this week that allegations that the department sent her there distort reality. Instead, Brown said the department helped her get funds from the states Victim Compensation Program so she could receive treatment. But Price said the facility was incapable of providing the kind of care that Abuslin needs. We have many lovely facilities in the Bay Area and throughout California. The kind of treatment she needs is not from a drug rehab facility, Price said. As a lawyer, I dont tamper with witnesses, she said. She is a witness to criminal activity, to criminal conspiracy in the Bay Area. There is no reason at all for why she is in Florida. Abuslin is expected to testify against seven current and former law enforcement officers, including five from the Oakland Police Department, who Alameda County District Attorney Nancy OMalley announced last week would be facing criminal charges. The most serious charges are for two officers accused of felony oral copulation with a minor. Price said Abuslin has been a victim of sex trafficking since she was 12 years old. She came under investigation by the Oakland Police Department last year for a relationship she had with Officer Brendan OBrien, who killed himself in September 2015 and implicated himself and other officers in a suicide note. Her attorneys have continued to suggest that there may be more such victims of exploitation who have not come forward. Bay Area police officers engaged in a conspiracy to sexually traffic children. She is not the only one, Price said. Its happening every day. It happened in a lot of different places under a lot of different circumstances. Payment can be money, it can be intimidation, it can be I will let you live today. I will kill you in this room. she said. This child has been kidnapped, she has been held against her will. The fact that she is alive today is a miracle. Despite the Oakland police internal investigation being opened last year, details of the scandal did not emerge publicly until May. Other departments, such as in Richmond and Livermore, did not learn of their officers involvement until after the case was reported in the media. Since then, dozens of officers in at least eight different law enforcement agencies have been implicated. Last week, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf announced that 12 Oakland police officers would be disciplined, including four who would be fired. Days later, OMalley announced criminal charges against five Oakland police officers, a Livermore officer and a Contra Costa County sheriffs deputy. A total of 11 Richmond police officers were investigated in connection with the scandal. Brown said this week that some of them would be fired or disciplined but refused to provide further details. Former Contra Costa County sheriffs Deputy Ricardo Perez and Oakland police Officer Giovanni LoVerde are each facing charges of felony oral copulation with a minor. If convicted, they could face 16 months to three years in state prison. Perez will also be charged with two counts of engaging in a lewd act in a public place. Former Livermore police Officer Dan Black will be charged with two counts of engaging in an act of prostitution and two counts of lewd acts in public. Oakland police Officer Brian Bunton faces one count of felony conspiracy to obstruct justice, which carries a possible sentence of a year in prison, and one misdemeanor charge of engaging in an act of prostitution. Retired Oakland police Officer Leroy Johnson will be charged with one count of failing to report sexual misconduct concerning a minor. Oakland police Officer Warit Utappa will be accused of searching official criminal justice data and computer systems for an unauthorized purpose. Former Oakland police Officer Tyrell Smith, who resigned in May, faces four counts of the same crime. Price called for possible federal intervention because of the widespread regional allegations. A federal judge overseeing court-mandated reforms to the Oakland Police Department as part of a 2003 settlement agreement already stepped in once in March, questioning the integrity of the departments internal affairs investigation. In his latest report issued Monday, court-appointed monitor Robert Warshaw said that while he was satisfied with the conclusion of the investigation, he was concerned about how it was initially handled. He reiterated that the fallout from the scandal has led to perhaps the most trying time in OPDs history. Judge Thelton Henderson wrote in his March 23 order, This case raises most serious concerns that may well impact Defendants ability to demonstrate their commitment to accountability and sustainability - both of which are key to ending court oversight. In his report Monday, Warshaw wrote, While there still remain some issues to be resolved regarding the sufficiency of resources devoted to the investigation until the matter was brought to the attention of the Court, we recognize the efforts of the City, OPD, and its leadership on this extensive investigation. --Bay City News/Image via Shutterstock",1

Five firefighters who were held captive were treated for superficial wounds at Gwinnett Medical Center in Lawrenceville.

1156,"- Two men and a woman were jailed Saturday morning, suspected of carjacking and kidnapping a woman then leading deputies on a chase from Calabasas to Woodland Hills. A deputy from the sheriffs Lost Hills Station pulled over a gray SUV for a traffic violation near Westward Way and Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu at 5:30 p.m. Friday, according to Deputy Trina Schrader of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department.

1159,"- A man who was found guilty Wednesday of raping and sodomizing a 9-year-old girl has been sentenced to serve three consecutive life sentences. Late Wednesday afternoon, a Cobb jury took just 40 minutes to convict Francisco Melendez, 19, of kidnapping, rape, aggravated child molestation, and aggravated sodomy for the acts he committed against the girl. Melendez was a friend of the girls family and was staying with the family in their apartment on Winterset Parkway, off Powers Ferry Road near Delk Road, in Marietta. Just after midnight on Dec. 7, 2014, Melendez woke the child up and took her outside and around the side of the apartment building, where he raped her.

The incident took place in the 100 block of North Arcturas Avenue, launching a search for a man with a distinctive dragon tattoo on the left side of his neck. Police also said their suspect had a blue wrist brace or cast on his right arm.

With that information in hand, detectives stopped by the business and ultimately ended up at the suspects home at 2236 Gulf to Bay Blvd., in the Boulevard Estates mobile home park. Police say they received written consent to search the mans home and found the clothing worn in the crime, along with a firearm stolen from the victims home.

1166,"Update for abducted cousins Lyric Cook-Morrissey and Elizabeth Collins from Evansdale. No evidence connecting that case with the Cedar Rapids-area incidents or another, has been made public by authorities. The Dubuque incident was investigated by police who said they questioned a man but did not press charges. However, the Cedar Rapids Gazette reported today that the FBI confirmed an alert in Evansdale on Wednesday was sparked by a reported kidnapping attempt in Cedar Rapids. Authorities released surveillance photos last night from Caseys gas station in Evansdale, showing a man and a white van there on the day the girls disappeared. The shortly after the photos were circulated. Authorities said he is not a suspect and cooperated fully, and no connection was found to the attempt in Cedar Rapids or the Evansdale case. A $50,000 reward has been offered for anyone who can provide information leading to the recovery of the Evansdale girls. Anyone with any information should call the tip line at 319-232-6682. Previous coverage Marion Police said there appears to be no connection to a recent Cedar Rapids kidnapping attempt and a strange incident that occurred in Marion last week. Last week a white van reportedly approached a boy in Marion and asked him if he wanted candy. The man made no contact with the boy, who immediately rode away on his bike. Lt. Scott Elam said that with the evidence they have, there is little to connect the two incidents, aside from a white van being involved in both cases. The Cedar Rapids incident occurred last Tuesday, late in the afternoon, when a father of a Cedar Rapids boy said he stopped a van with three riders from abducting the boy while he was on his bike. Despite being no clear connection, Elam said the police department received numerous calls from residents who claimed to see a white van in their neighborhood.

1169,"Antolin Garcia-Torres, 26, was found guilty by a Santa Clara County Superior Court jury in San Jose this morning for the first-degree murder of 15-year-old Sierra LaMar in 2012. Sierra has not been seen or heard from since March 16, 2012, and Garcia-Torres was arrested on May 21, 2012, after investigators found his DNA on her jeans, which were recovered near where she went missing outside of Morgan Hill. Sierras DNA was also found on an interior backseat door handle and on the outside of a pair of work gloves in Garcia-Torres car. The jury, which began deliberating Thursday morning after a 13-week trial and announced that they had reached a verdict Monday afternoon, also convicted Garcia-Torres of the attempted kidnappings of three women in Safeway parking lots in 2009. >>Related: Sierra LaMar Murder: Jury Convicts Antolin Garcia-Torres In Death Of 15-Year-Old All 129 seats were taken in the main courtroom and an overflow room with a live video feed of the proceedings this morning, leaving more than a dozen observers standing. Some of the more than 750 volunteers who searched for Sierra after she went missing arrived more than an hour before the verdict was read. Observers in the overflow room erupted in applause and loud cheers as many volunteers cried and embraced each other after the verdict was read. Garcia-Torres, wearing a button-down shirt and blue tie, looked down with his hands under the table after Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Vanessa Zecher read the verdict. Extra sheriffs deputies provided special security in both courtrooms. Members of the defense team and Garcia-Torres family and friends, who had sat behind him in the courtroom but have not been in attendance for most of the trial, declined to comment as they left the courthouse. Sierras mother Marlene LaMar spoke outside of the courthouse of the sorrow weve experienced every day, that we will continue to experience for the rest of our lives despite the verdict. Steve LaMar, Sierras father, said he felt a rush of emotions when the verdict was read. All that anticipation, I think its all pent up, all the years of frustration, not finding answers, not finding her, he said. Steve LaMar said he was glad the death penalty was still on the table. The penalty phase of the trial, in which the jury will decide between the death penalty and life in prison without parole, is set to begin on May 16. — Bay City News; Image via Patch Archive Also See:",1
1170,"A 35-year-old Portland man was sentenced to 18 years in federal prison on Monday after pleading guilty in a federal court to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Jeramy Theodore Carpenter was 33 in September 2016 when he arranged to sell two ounces of meth for $800 with the help of his co-conspirator, Joshua Joseph Howard — who is now 36. The pair arranged to meet their unidentified buyer at the Glendoveer Golf Course on Sept. 15, 2016. When the buyer got into the front passenger seat of the vehicle, which Howard was driving, Carpenter rose from the backseat and put a knife to the buyers throat, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by Patch. Striking the buyer with the butt of a gun before holding the barrel to the buyers head, Carpenter asked, Wheres my money? Roughly three weeks before his abduction, the buyer reportedly stole $25,000 from another meth supplier for whom Carpenter worked. Unwilling to give up the money right away, the buyer was then taken to Carpenters house and held in the garage until the next day while under constant watch by either Carpenter or Howard. While the buyer was there, someone took his car and brought it to Carpenters home. Carpenter told the buyer that if he did not give up the money his car would be burned. Carpenter also reportedly told the buyer that his life was on the line. Eventually, the buyer told Howard and Carpenter the money was being stored in a safe deposit box at his work. Howard and Carpenter immediately drove the buyer to his job to retrieve the money. But when the buyer got out of the car, he went through his work to a rear door, ran into some nearby trees, and eventually hopped on a bus to complete his escape. Afterward, the buyer called police. The ensuing investigation resulted in a search warrant for Carpenters home, where detectives found the buyers car and a considerable amount of incriminating evidence, which included four firearms in total, roughly 1,400 grams of meth, scales, drug records, three sets of brass knuckles, and $1,000 in cash. Howards charges were also deferred to a federal court. It does not appear as though the buyer suffered any legal consequences for his role in the situation — though his criminal history is equally as colorful as his aggressors.

1171,"A former Salinas City Councilman was convicted this week of felony kidnapping, domestic violence and stalking, but the Monterey County Superior Court jury could not reach a unanimous decision on charges of misdemeanor sexual battery, prosecutors said. Jose Castañeda approached an ex-girlfriend in front of her home after midnight on Sept. 5, 2015, Monterey County prosecutors said. She refused to speak with him and Castañeda then dragged her to his mothers van and drove her away. Castañeda struck the victim repeatedly then demanded her phone and social media passwords, but she refused and he continued to beat her, prosecutors said. The victim was released and allowed to walk home after her battery died. She reported the assault two days later when Castañeda returned to her home. He faces up to nine years and eight months in prison when he goes to sentencing on June 22. Castañeda was elected to the City Council in 2012 but lost in a bid for re-election last year. During his time in office, he was censured by his fellow council members who alleged he intimidated city staff, failed to pay a $5,000 fine related to a legal dispute over his refusal to resign from the Alisal Union School District board while also serving on the Council, and failed to complete state-mandated ethics training.

Update 11:37 a.m. Friday: Midwest Animal Rescue and Services posted the following on their Facebook page at about 9:30 a.m. today: We would like to thank all of you on behalf of Cesars family for the incredible outpouring of love and support through this time. Cesar is home and resting and he has a long road ahead of him for recovery, not only physically but also emotionally. He is an amazing dog and we have been blessed to call him part of our family. Please keep the positive thoughts going for his recovery and be sure to hug your furry faced family members a little more each day. We will keep you updated on his progress. Again, thank you. Authorities are looking for those responsible – and are now offering a $1,000 for information leading to an arrest – for beating and torturing a dog in Savage. According to a report from KARE 11, the attack on Cesar, a pitbull, occurred on Wednesday afternoon, after his owners let him out into a fenced yard with two other dogs. About 20 minutes later, Cesar appeared in the famillys driveway, limping and bloodied. The two other dogs, a black lab and Chihuahua mix, were unharmed. Investigators say theyre pretty sure it was not a random attack because the message back off was scrawled on the dogs back, according to a report on FOX 9 News. The dogs owner, Robert Cole, is a dog trainer who specializes in calming aggressive dogs, the report said. Since his work frequently puts him in contact with Midwest Animal Rescue and Services, they paid his vet bill -- and have established a fund to help cover costs. Anyone wishing to donate can make a contribution online. Midwest Animal Rescue and Services, which first reported the incident on its Facebook page, issued a statement in which they say the dog was targeted because of his breed, which is often depicted as violent in popular media. Midwest Animal Rescue and Services is taking a stand in this situation because we personally know Cesar and his standing as an ambassador for his breed. He is a pit bull. We have worked directly with him and he has assisted us in rehabilitating dogs. We want to highlight this tragedy and the atrocity of what a human can do to an animal so it does not happen again. He is not a savage as a pit bull is portrayed so often in the media. However, how this breed has been portrayed in the media perpetrates what was done to him simply because of his breed. Anyone with information on the case is asked to call Savage Police at 952-882-2600. The reward of $1,000 has been offered by Savage police for information leading to an arrest in this crime.

Frosh and his Division believe Swift Van Lines gave consumers low estimates for moving services and then drastically increased its prices after loading customers items onto its trucks. The movers sometimes charged several times the estimate, Frosh said. If the customers refused to pay the increased amounts, the drivers allegedly drove off with the goods still on its trucks. Moving companies operating in Maryland cannot hold a consumers items hostage, Frosh said in a statement. When moving consumers within the State, companies cannot exploit consumers either by charging substantially more than promised or by refusing to deliver household goods once they are loaded onto a truck. These charges seek an order that would permanently prohibit Swift Van Lines and its owner from hiking up the price and refusing to deliver to customers. It also orders Swift to pay restitution to consumers harmed by its alleged unfair and deceptive practices, the news release states. Consumers with complaints against Swift Van Lines, LLC, Revolution Moving and Storage, LLC or Juan Carlos Martinez may call the Consumer Protection Division at 410-576-6569, file a complaint online, or write to the Consumer Protection Division at 200 St. Paul Place, 16th Floor, Baltimore, Maryland 21202.

1186,"By FRANK OLAUGHLIN (Patch Staff) The Boston Police Department is warning residents across the city to exercise caution as an ongoing phone extortion scam runs rampant. Police say the scam happens when a caller claims to be holding one of the victims relatives hostage or says a relative has been in a serious accident and needs money. According to the department, in a growing amount of cases in Boston, suspects are demanding large sums of money. They then threaten harm to the victims relatives if the demand is not agreed upon. Police say its not uncommon for the suspects to know basic details about the victims life. Names of family members, places of employment and school information, can be easily found on social media websites. In some cases, the caller phones several members of the same family, extracting information from one person that is then leveraged against a relative to increase the credibility of the callers claims. Victims are often told that if they hang up or contact the police or anyone else, harm will come to their loved one, police say. The scam appears to target the Hispanic community and is known to be an issue in several other cities across the United States, police say. Residents that receive a call similar to the above scheme are advised to: Victims are encouraged to report any Phone or Internet Fraud Scams to the Federal Trade Commission by calling 1-866-653-4261.",0

1192,"During a 2016 gun show in Berea, a Cleveland man with a history of kidnapping and felonious assault stole a .45-caliber pistol. Anthony Lett, 40, was convicted this week for that theft. This is a person with a long history of violence who has no business having a firearm, U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman said. Our community is safer with him behind bars. Lett was convicted on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and one count of being in possession of a stolen firearm. His trial lasted two days in the U.S. District Court. The 40-year-old will be sentenced on August 29. During a gun show at the Cuyahoga County Fairgrounds, Lett snatched a Kahr Arms .45-caliber pistol. He was soon tracked by police and fled into the woods behind the fairgrounds, Cory Shaffer from cleveland.com reported at the time.

1193,"Submitted by the Suffolk County DAs Office The man who robbed and raped a Beacon Hill woman after his release from prison on an earlier sexual assault could die behind bars, Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said on Friday. Scheduled for trial Monday on charges of aggravated rape, kidnapping, armed robbery, armed burglary, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, Anthony G. Williams (D.O.B. 4/2/67) pleaded guilty to all counts this afternoon in Suffolk Superior Court, said the Suffolk County DAs office. Assistant District Attorney Holly Broadbent, chief of Conleys Sexual Assault Unit, recommended that Williams serve 25 to 28 years in state prison, followed by 10 years of probation upon his release. Broadbent recommended that, as conditions of his probation, he be ordered to wear a GPS monitoring device, undergo sex offender treatment, and have no contact with the victim. Judge Linda Giles imposed a term of 18 to 22 years in prison but adopted all of Broadbents other recommendations. Giles noted that state sentencing guidelines call for a sentence of 12 to 18 years. Our recommendation went well beyond the average sentencing guidelines for two reasons, Conley said. First, this crime was not average. It was as vicious and terrifying as can be imagined. Second, the defendant had just finished a lengthy state prison term for the same offense. He has additional convictions for crimes of violence against women. He needs to be taken off the street and away from society. Moreover, a review of his record suggests that hes a candidate for civil commitment under the states sexually dangerous person statute, which would allow him to be held even after his release from prison. While the victims of any crime are asked to call 911 in an emergency, Conley said that survivors of sexual violence in Suffolk County can also call the Boston Area Rape Crisis Centers 24-hour hotline at 800-841-8371. The Boston Area Rape Crisis Center provides medical advocacy, legal services, counseling, and other services to victims of rape and sexual assault. Had the case proceeded to trial, Broadbent would have introduced evidence and testimony to prove that Williams followed the woman, then 28, as she approached her home in the early morning hours of Nov. 10, 2012. He followed her into her apartment building and, as she entered her apartment, forced his way inside, where he robbed her of jewelry, electronic devices, and her bank card. He then sexually assaulted her at knifepoint and threatened to return and kill her if the ATM password she provided was incorrect. The victim was able to contact a neighbor, who called 911. She was transported to an area hospital for treatment, while Boston Police sexual assault detectives undertook a search for evidence and witnesses. Among other things, they were able to retrieve footage from a bank lobby where Williams used the victims debit card and additional footage showing him selling her iPad and iPhone. When detectives released it to the public, they received multiple tips identifying him, leading to his arrest. That surveillance footage was crucial in helping us build our case, Conley said. Surveillance cameras can only help investigate, solve, and prosecute violent crimes, but were routinely delayed by hours or even days trying to get footage from private businesses. Cameras operated by city or state agencies could provide that footage on a moments notice without violating the privacy we enjoy as Americans. Williams was represented by attorney Kelli Porges.",1

1197,"A new wave of ransomware cyberattacks spread globally on Tuesday, affecting businesses and agencies across the globe. The ransomware in question, known as Petya or Petrwrap, locked users and companies out of essential computer files, demanding a fee be paid before the information would be unleashed. The attacks appeared to first start in Ukraine. The software used resembles Wannacry, the ransomware responsible for multiple cyberattacks in recent months, most notably in May during an attack that gravely threatened the British health service. (For more national stories, subscribe to the Across America Patch and receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts.) Wannacry was the start of a new breed of ransomware — where nation state attackers were likely responsible for the malware, said Paul Martini, CEO of iboss, the cybersecurity firm of Goldman Sachs. While its obviously too early to know who is behind this attack, it bears a strong resemblance to Wannacry. We can expect ransomware attacks to continue getting more sophisticated with serious and widespread implications for critical infrastructure. Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity firm, reported that the malware in question used a Microsoft signature to break through cyber defenses: The Department of Homeland Security is monitoring reports of cyber attacks affecting multiple global entities and is coordinating with our international and domestic partners, DHS said in a statement. We stand ready to support any requests for assistance. Upon requests, DHS routinely provides technical analysis and support.

Previous Coverage: San Leandro police Lt. Robert McManus described the 43-year-old suspects attempt to kidnap the 23-year-old woman as she was walking to work in the 14700 block of Washington Avenue at 7:45 a.m. on July 28 as an attempted stranger abduction and as something you would see in a television crime drama. McManus said a passerby who saw the struggle and intervened, allowing the woman to escape, was a Good Samaritan and a hero. However, he said the suspect drove away from the crime scene, ditched his car near the Oakland International Airport, took a long flight across the country and might have gotten away with the crime if not for a business owner near the airport who told police on Aug. 17 that the suspects silver 2014 Nissan Sentra SR car was parked nearby. That information helped investigators break the case because they were able to track the car and ultimately identify the suspect, McManus said. Scientific and technological evidence put the suspect at the scene of the attempted abduction and U.S. Marshals were able to locate him early last week and arrest him without incident, according to McManus. However, police arent yet releasing the suspects name or mugshot or saying where he was arrested because they are still investigating whether he may have committed other crimes, including other possible abductions. He said the suspect, who is from Orange County, had just been paroled from state prison on July 18, 10 days before the attempted abduction, after serving a his conviction for what he described as a variety of violent crimes. McManus said the suspect is in custody at the location where he was arrested out of state and is expected to be extradited in two or three weeks to Alameda County, where he faces kidnapping, carjacking and assault with a deadly weapon charges for the San Leandro incident. He said the suspect is charged with carjacking because he briefly got into the Good Samaritans car and moved it because it was blocking his own car when he was trying to get away from the scene. McManus said the suspect didnt know the victim and at this time investigators dont know why he drove all the way from Orange County to San Leandro to commit the crime. He said police dont know how long the suspect was in San Leandro but he had still been in Southern California as of the morning of July 27, the day before the incident. McManus said police dont know the suspects intentions for trying to kidnap the woman but he said, Based on his record they probably werent good. McManus said it appears that the suspect bought his plane ticket after the incident in San Leandro. He said the man took a long flight to another state where he has relatives and apparently was trying to start a new life there. San Leandro acting police Chief Jeff Tudor said, The notion of a stranger grabbing a person off the street invoked a lot of fear in our community and my heart goes out to the victim. Her strength and courage is inspirational to us. McManus said the victim was very relieved when police told her that the suspect has been arrested. — Bay City News; Image via San Leandro Police",0

1212,"A United Airlines flight returned to Dulles Thursday — five hours after it had taken off on a flight to Beijing — to return a woman wanted for allegedly kidnapping her child, according to several news reports. A custody battle apparently is what set off the return of a planeload of 180 passengers, after the FBI requested that the flight return to Dulles, according to a CBS News report. After Flight 897 lifted off at 12:39 p.m. from Dulles International Airport, located in Northern Virginia just west of Washington, D.C., it turned around five hours later to return, after authorities told airline officials a kidnapping suspect was on board. The childs father alerted the FBI, the news report said, because he thought the childs mother was taking his son to China and not planning to return. The pilot told passengers the return to the airport was due to mechanical difficulties. At the airport, the mother was taken into custody by authorities on attempted kidnapping charges; her mother, who was reportedly accompanying her, was not taken into custody.

1214,"Written By RICH SCINTO (Patch Staff) TRUMBULL, CT- Members of the U.S. Marshals Service took the man accused of assaulting his estranged wife and kidnapping his son into custody. Rodolfo Revello has been wanted since March 12 when he allegedly broke into his estranged wifes home on Unity Road around 4:30 a.m. He was found in the Bronx. Revello is being charged with violation of federal probation and arrangements are being made to serve him with the arrest warrant from Trumbull Police, said Lt. Leonard Scinto, police spokesman. The warrant charges him with kidnapping, larceny, strangulation, assault, threatening and criminal mischief in the second degree. He will also be charged with disorderly conduct and criminal violation of a restraining order.

1215,"Authorities say 10 people — four adults and six juveniles — have been charged in what is now described as the gang-related murder of a 15-year old Gaithersburg girl whose body was found in Springfield, Virginia. The remains of Damaris Reyes Rivas, of Gaithersburg, who was reported missing in December, were found Saturday near a Springfield industrial park. On Wednesday, Virginia authorities charged the 10 suspects with abduction and gang participation. Additional charges are pending further investigation and detectives are working with the Office of the Commonwealths Attorney, Fairfax County Police said at an afternoon news conference. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, through an autopsy, has ruled Reyes Rivas death a homicide, police said. Questions are being raised about why Montgomery County Police, who frequently use social media to release photos and information about missing residents, never issued such an alert for Damaris A. Reyes Rivas, 15. While police tracked her cell phone and social media use, and made flyers to hand out in Gaithersburg, the department didnt issue a missing person alert on its Facebook or Twitter accounts, which it does frequently in similar cases. According to Fairfax County Police the four adults charged in the girls death are: Six teenagers have also been charged with abduction and gang participation, police said. One of them, a 16-year-old girl, is still being sought by police. The other teens facing charges are: Police said at an afternoon news conference that more charges will be made public soon, possibly as early as Thursday. Police said that the murder was gang-related and only related to one gang. Its the policy, the spokesman said, not to name the gangs. Police determined Reyes Rivas was held against her will, taken to Lake Accotink Park in Fairfax County and assaulted before she was killed and left nearby in the 7100 block of Wimsatt Road. Detectives believe this occurred on or around Jan. 8. Her body was found on Saturday, Feb. 11. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Fairfax County police at 703-691-2131 or you can Crime Solvers electronically by visiting http://www.fairfaxcrimesolvers.org or text-a-tip by texting TIP187 plus your message to CRIMES(274637). Fairfax County Police said they were helping another jurisdiction with the search for a missing juvenile when they found the remains. A public information officer told The Washington Post that Reyes Rivas had left home willingly; the Post also reported that detectives believe the girl was killed in Fairfax County. We were getting reports that she was involved or acquainted with gang activity, the spokesperson told the newspaper. We are looking into the possibility that this might have played a role in her death. Tuesday afternoon, Montgomery County Police responded to queries about how the department handled the missing persons report for Reyes Rivas. Authorities say the teen was entered as a missing person in the National Crime Information Center database, which is available to law enforcement nationwide. Information about the girl and her photograph were also placed on an internal Montgomery County Police website. Investigators say Reyes Rivas mother told them her daughter had left home before and while she was gone, the teen remained in contact with her mother. When Damaris learned her mother made plans to have her daughter live out-of-state with a family member, she left home again on Dec. 10. Detectives contacted Montgomery County Public School officials, along with Damaris friends to locate her, and monitored her social media account and cell phone, and conducted surveillance of areas she was believed to frequent. Police say a missing person flyer that included Damaris photograph and physical description was distributed in Gaithersburg and part of Fairfax County. The teens family shared the flyers on social media, but they werent shared on the police departments Facebook or Twitter accounts. Montgomery County investigators are reviewing steps taken in the case, as well as police department practices regarding critical missing persons. Montgomery County Police Capt. Paul Starks told WUSA9 a missing person report was filed in December with the department, but Reyes Rivas case was not publicized because her disappearance was not considered critical. That determination is made using criteria from the National Crime Information Center, but one of the centers guidelines says anyone missing under the age of 21 should be deemed a critical missing person. Police say the teenager used social media, spoke with friends, and replied to a text message from detectives in January, and told her mother she was fine but would not return home. Authorities say the girl likely died sometime last month. — Patch Editor Mary Ann Barton contributed to this story. PHOTOS courtesy of Fairfax County Police",1

1218,"A U.S. District judge on Friday allowed attorneys for a Champaign man accused of kidnapping of visiting Chinese scholar Yingying Zhang to withdraw from the case. Lawyer Tom Bruno and his sons, Anthony and Evan Bruno, last week filed a U.S. District Court motion asking to withdraw from Brendt Christensens defense, saying the accused kidnapper, suspected in the abduction and possible murder of 26-year-old Zhang, cant afford to pay them for what could become a death-penalty case if additional charges are filed, the Champaign/Urbana News-Gazette reported. Judge Colin Bruce granted the lawyers request and said that a new attorney, paid with federal funds, will be brought in to represent Christensen. Zhang, a visiting scholar at the University of Illinois, vanished June 9. She was last seen on surveillance video getting into a Black Saturn Astra — the same vehicle authorities say was owned by Christensen. Zhang arrived in Urbana in April and was on her way to sign a lease for an apartment when she went missing. Authorities have said they believe she is dead. During an interview with FBI agents, Christensen reportedly admitted to giving Zhang a ride, but said he let her out of the vehicle when she asked. Christensen, who was spotted at a vigil held at U of I for Zhang, was under surveillance when investigators say they recorded audio of him talking about how Zhang fought him when he kidnapped her before taking her back to his apartment. Authorities say he also visited an Abduction 101 forum on the website FetLife. He was arrested June 30. A motion filed by Christensens attorneys last week said if additional charges are filed, he could require a death-penalty defense — and he cant afford it. In late August, the government suggested in open court that it would seek a superseding Grand Jury indictment on additional charges within the next 30 to 45 days, the motion states, according to the News-Gazette. Attorneys reasonably anticipate that such additional charges may implicate the prospect of capital punishment ... Despite best efforts over the past two months, Defendant and his family have been unable to secure sufficient additional funds to pay Attorneys for representation on additional charges.

1224,"Its the biggest murder mystery in Joliets history, a crime that has been the topic of bar room chatter, family reunions and dinner table conversations for generations here in Will County. What happened to Amelia Molly Zelko? On September 25, 1957, the 47-year-old Joliet Spectator part-owner and business manager parked her car on Buell Avenue after putting the newspaper to bed. Some neighbors heard a scream. Authorities found her shoes. But her body was never found. Her killers were never caught. Is Molly Zelkos disappearance destined to remain a Joliet cold case forever? Perhaps not. The 61-year-old mystery will come back to life beginning this fall, thanks to the work of former Joliet Herald-News investigative reporter Lonny Cain and Greg Peerbolte, executive director of the Joliet Area Historical Museum in downtown Joliet. The two have been busy for many months producing a multi-part audio podcast that aims to introduce the Joliet legend to a new generation of true-crime listeners. Lynne Lichtenauer, a former Spectator reporter who came on board after Zelkos disappearance, and Dennis Enrietta, an independent researcher from Coal City, are also involved in the project and will be featured in the podcasts. The Joliet Public Library has also been invaluable in letting the group use their digital media studio at the downtown branch for production and editing, Peerbolte said. At the moment, the plan is to unveil eight parts in the Molly Zelko podcast. Each one will be about 30 minutes long. Editing for the first three episodes has been completed, Peerbolte said. The museum wants to launch the podcast series coinciding with the upcoming Zelko anniversary, September 25. Its an ambitious goal, but its very doable, Peerbolte said. With the effect that podcasts have had on cold cases, we just thought it was a perfect medium to tell this story, and the reaction you get when you tell people who arent familiar with this story, they are just shocked that they dont know about it, Peerbolte said. You have the involvement of Robert F. Kennedy (investigating the case), FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover requested weekly updates, and the very likely possible involvement of the Chicago outfit. Its just compelling, and its a story you cant believe you havent heard. The Molly Zelko podcasts will likely be uploaded to the website of either the Joliet Public Library or the museum and will be made easily accessible for the general public, Peerbolte explained. We want it produced as well as any of the best podcasts that are out there, Peerbolte added. In 1978, Cain and late Herald-News columnist John Whiteside spent several months producing a lengthy series re-examining the Zelko mystery. At that time, the unsolved case was 21 years old. What does Cain, who later became managing editor at The Times in Ottawa and has since retired from the newspaper industry, have to say about the podcast series? Its pretty monumental. I think its going to stir up a lot of interest in the story. Cain, who is writing a book about the Zelko case, has also been active on social media. He said the Search For Molly Zelko Facebook page has fueled a lot of interest.  Theres a new generation of readers and audiences that are getting into the story, Cain told Joliet Patch last week. I personally think she was taken and in the (1978 newspaper) series, we had a witness who was in her twenties (in 1957) who lived on Stryker Avenue, Cain told Patch. She witnessed a body being buried in a storm sewer on Stryker Avenue. The witness was never identified (in our newspaper stories). She was put under hypnosis ... Cain said the woman has since passed away, but he remains in regular contact with her family. He believes her story is credible. The woman did not go to the Joliet Police with her eyewitness account back in 1957, because she feared the police, he said. Back in the 1950s, Cain said, a number of police officers had suspected connections to area mobsters. On the night of Zelkos disappearance, the eyewitness had young children and her marriage was on the rocks. She divorced soon afterward. But that night, her husband was out on the town late into night, so she was up waiting for his return. Suddenly, a large black car pulled up along Stryker Avenue as the young woman peered outside into the darkness from her bedroom. It was somewhere between midnight and 1 a.m. when she saw something disturbing outside, Cain said. The black car stopped. The woman saw four guys getting out, Cain said. The men opened the trunk. They grabbed a rug or tarp-like material. A leg flopped out, Cain said. She was convinced it was a woman, and it was a body, Cain added. Early that next day, contractors involved in the ongoing storm sewer project subsequently laid a section of new pipe over the area where the body was reportedly dumped, Cain said. In 1978, Cain said, as part of the series, the eyewitness was put under hypnosis and asked several questions about what she remembered. The podcast will get into details of that event, Cain said. Its pretty dramatic, he said. She was a very small woman in a large leather chair ... At one point during the hypnosis, the womans hand started pounding against the chair as she was asked about the night in question, Cain said. The hypnotist was the late Dr. George Honiotos, a long-time, well-known Joliet area physician. His expert opinion, Cain said, was that she lived through a traumatic experience on Sept. 25, 1957. In 1957, Zelko left The Spectator after she put the paper to bed around 11:30 p.m. The house she rented on Buell Avenue wasnt far from her weekly newspaper building. Cain is convinced she never made it inside the house. The jewelry she was wearing was also not found. Added Peerbolte, There was no evidence that she made it into the house or slept in the bed. The only sign of Zelko was her shoes. They were recovered from the scene of her abduction. Over the years, there was speculation around Joliet that maybe Zelko faked her disappearance and took on a new identity. One theory was that she was in the witness protection program and she took off on her own, Cain said. But he and Whiteside thoroughly researched that angle and never found any evidence to substantiate that. Meanwhile, there have been a significant number of theories about where Zelkos body was buried. Many of those theories were debunked over the decades, Cain said, except for the one that has remained on his mind for years. Cain believes the most logical scenario is that Zelko remains buried underneath Joliets Stryker Avenue on the citys west side. Its just a nagging question that has bothered me since 1978, Cain said. The challenge, at this stage, would be identifying the precise location where her body was put. Cain went on to say, My personal belief is that the mob had something to do with it. She was a real pain in the butt. So, the safest bet is that the mob was involved. Being a longtime newspaperman, Cain is a realist. Were approaching the 61st anniversary of the disappearance. Identifying the true culprits involved in the abduction, murder and disposal of her body isnt practical, he admits. Its been over 60 years, Cain acknowledged. What I would like to do, in the best case scenario, is find the body. Cain believes theres enough intrigue that perhaps somebody at the Will County States Attorneys Office and the Joliet Police Department will want to take a renewed interest in her case, especially once they hear the upcoming podcasts. I think that there are law enforcement people who have an interest in the mystery. Its pretty fascinating, he said. Im pretty sure she was taken, and she died that night and shes buried somewhere. I still think Stryker Avenue is the best place to look.

1225,"By KAREN WALL and JUSTIN HEINZE A woman whose 911 call claiming she was being abducted led to a massive law enforcement response in New Jersey was found in a hotel in Willow Grove, acting Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher J. Gramiccioni announced Thursday afternoon. Marian Petro, 46, of Fort Lee, was found Tuesday where she was staying with extended family, said Charles Webster, spokesman for the Monmouth County Prosecutors Office. The incident began with a 911 call received by Monroe Township police about 6:35 a.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 19, Webster said. In the call, the woman -- now identified as Petro -- said she was pulled over in a vehicle and forced into the back seat of another car at gunpoint near the intersection of Route 33 and Sweetmans Lane in Manalapan, Webster said. Manalapan police officers responded but were unable to find the woman, the car or any witnesses to the incident, he said. The investigation led to a possible location in the area of Hulses Corner Road and Fort Plains Road in Howell, Webster said, where police from several towns, as well as county, state and federal law enforcement agencies responded in an effort to find the victim. That investigation did not yield the reported victim, vehicle or any additional evidence of an abduction, Webster said. After the area was cleared, the efforts to locate the caller and substantiate the report intensified, Webster said. On Tuesday, she was found, unharmed, at a hotel in Willow, Grove, Pa., where she was staying with her extended family. Further investigation revealed she had purposely made several false statements in her 911 call when she claimed she was held at gunpoint and put into the backseat of a black Mercedes Benz by a black male with dreadlocks, Webster said. Petro is charged with third-degree creating a false public alarm. She is being held in the Montgomery Township Correctional Facility, Lower Providence, Pa., pending extradition to New Jersey, he said. If convicted of creating a false public alarm, Petro faces a sentence of three to five years in prison. The case is assigned to Monmouth County Assistant Prosecutor Christopher Decker, director of the Offices Major Crimes Bureau, Webster said. The joint investigation was conducted with the partnership of the Manalapan Township Police Department, Howell Township Police Department, Howell Township Office of Emergency Management, Fort Lee Police Department, Carteret Police Department, Upper Moreland Township, Pa., Police Department, Hatboro, Pa., Police Department, New York City Police Department, Monmouth County Prosecutors Office, Monmouth County Sheriffs Office, Monmouth County Office of Emergency Management, Monmouth County Emergency Response Team, New Jersey State Police, United State Marshals Service, and Federal Bureau of Investigation.",1

1230,"David Michael Tyler put on a fake beard and dark-tinted glasses Saturday morning walked into US Bank, set a black briefcase down on a desk—and passed an employee a note stating: Its going to be a real good day or a real bad day, according to felony charges filed Monday in Washington County District Court. Then he allegedly opened the briefcase, and revealed a note that read: enough explosives to level the entire block. Tyler, 55, of Cheboygan, Michigan, told police he is a career criminal who owes $90,000 in child-support payments and felt he had no option but to rob a bank. On Monday, Tyler was charged by the Washington County Attorneys Office with second-degree aggravated robbery in connection with Saturdays incident that prompted the closure of a two-block radius around the bank. Tyler, in a note he allegedly wrote last week at the Cheboygan Area Public Library, demanded $200,000 in cash. After showing what Tyler purported to be a bomb, he allegedly told bank employees to stuff a backpack full of money. Before fleeing the scene on foot, Tyler pushed a button on his cell phone and told the bank employees he had just activated the bomb, the complaint states, and it will detonate in 10 minutes. Police arrested Tyler while he was running to a truck he parked on Myrtle Street, just west of Main Street. He had $3,726 in his backpack. According to the complaint, Tyler had been plotting to rob a Stillwater bank for about a week. Tyler told police he made the fake bomb at his apartment in Michigan, and then drove to Duluth, but he couldnt find a promising target, so he went back to the drawing board. He then put his finger on an atlas and landed on Forest Lake, the complaint states. So Tyler drove to Forest Lake, but once again he could not find a bank he was comfortable with, the complaint states. On June 2, Tyler reportedly checked into the Super 8 just off of Highway 36 and began scouting banks, the complaint states. During that week, he also bought a beard-and-mustache kit. The night before the attempted bank robbery, Tyler got a room at the Lowell Inn. Tyler told police he has served time for bank robbery and kidnapping incidents during the mid-1970s.

1239,"Four people were arrested in connection with the kidnapping and death of a 3-week-old Long Beach girl whose body was found in a San Diego County trash bin, police announced today. Eliza De La Cruz was abducted Jan. 3 after several members of her family were shot in the Long Beach area. Her body was found the following day. Police said Giseleangelique Rene DMilian, 47, of Thousand Oaks; Anthony McCall, 29, of Oceanside; Todd Damon Boudreaux, 43, of Fontana; and Charisse Shelton, 29, of Corona, were arrested in connection with the case. Boudreaux and Shelton are accused of being accessories after the fact. DMilian and McCall have been booked on suspicion of murder, kidnapping, attempted murder and conspiracy, police said. Long Beach police Chief Robert Luna said DMilian lied to her boyfriend last year, telling him she was pregnant with his twins. She later told him she had given birth to the children in December while out of the country, Luna said. Luna called DMilian and McCall evil, telling the Los Angeles Times, Weve never seen anything like this where somebody goes out looking for babies to kidnap and they attempt to kill the mothers.These people are just evil in nature. Police from Long Beach noted that there was another attempt to steal a baby about a month later in El Segundo. In that case a mother living in a motel was beaten with a baseball bat, but her 4-month-old baby was not taken. According to Luna, DMilian had never given birth, but in order to further the deception, she needed to find two infants who matched the ages of her fabricated twins. Luna said DMilian and McCall came up with a plan to kidnap Eliza and pass her off as her own child. Elizas abduction, and the shootings of her parents and uncle in northern Long Beach, occurred about 5:50 p.m. Jan. 3 at the familys home in the 100 block of West 51st Street. The infants body was found the following afternoon in a trash bin at a commercial strip mall in Imperial Beach. Her family members survived the shooting. Police said Elizas mother was walking home with her infant daughter from a bus stop at Del Amo and Long Beach boulevards, about 90 minutes before the shooting, when a woman -- believed to be DMilian -- pulled up next to them in a black Range Rover and asked about her baby. Luna said the woman had a brief exchange with the mother, then drove away. He said detectives later determined that DMilian and McCall had both been following the bus Eliza and her mother were on, in separate vehicles. About 90 minutes after they got off the bus, McCall showed up at the De La Cruz home, shot the three adults and abducted the baby, Luna said. The reason baby Eliza was killed remains unknown, Luna said. He declined to reveal how the infant was killed. Long Beach police had previously released composite drawings of the woman and the gunman, as well as security video showing the SUV following the victims bus.

1241,"Turkish gold trader Reza Zarrab pleaded guilty to charges and will reveal how he helped Iran skirt U.S. sanctions in an economic jihad, a federal prosecutor said on Tuesday. Zarrab will become a major witness against Turkish banker Mehmet Hakan Atilla, Assistant U.S. Attorney David Denton said. The scheme to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran since 2011 allowed billions of dollars to be moved and threatened Americas national security, the prosecutor said. Defense attorney Victor Rocco attacked Zarrabs credibility in his opening statement, saying the case was really about Zarrabs crimes. Zarrab cut a deal to obtain a get-out-of-jail-free card, the defense attorneysaid, possibly joining the U.S. witness protection program so he and his family can live in America. The case in New York City against Zarrab and Atilla, deputy CEO of Halkbank, has strained relations between the U.S. and Turkey. Tuesdays revelation came as defense attorney Robert Fettweis asked for a two-week delay of Atillas trial. Fettweis said he needed time to prepare for Zarrabs testimony and said prosecutors recently released 10,000 pages of evidence — including emails — linked to Zarrab. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman denied the request and said lawyers shouldve known for months that Zarrab would testify. Assistant U.S. Attorney Sidhardha Kamaraju said Zarrab would take the stand Wednesday. Zarrab stopped appearing in court weeks ago fueling speculation that hed cut a deal and was cooperating with federal officials. A prosecutor said in court Tuesday that Zarrab would testify as part of a plea deal but gave no other details on it. The prosecution in Manhattan has been major news in Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly asked the U.S. to release Zarrab, who is married to Turkish pop star and TV personality Ebru Gundes. And recently, Turkeys deputy prime minister said Zarrab was a hostage being forced to testify against Turkeys government. On Tuesday, a Turkish prosecutor issued warrants for the detention of two citizens for cooperating with U.S. prosecutors. The Istanbul chief prosecutors office ordered the arrests of Osman Zeki Canitez and former opposition party legislator Aykan Erdemir, according to Turkeys state-run news agency, Anadolu Agency. Zarrab, a 34-year-old dual citizen of Turkey and Iran, was arrested on a trip to the U.S. in 2016 as he prepared to take his family to Disney World. Earlier this year, Zarrab hired former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey to try and broker a diplomatic solution to the case. Zarrab had initially been arrested in Turkey in 2013 as part of a sweeping corruption investigation involving several top Erdogan lieutenants and Halkbank, the state bank. But prosecutors and police involved in the corruption accusations were removed from duty and the charges were later dropped. Since then, Erdogans administration has tightened control over the country, arresting at least 50,000 people following 2016 coup attempt he said was orchestrated by Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Several Americans have also been arrested in that crackdown. Erdogan has demanded that Gulen be handed over to Turkey, perhaps in exchange for detained Americans. Gulen has denied having any role in the coup. Erdogan has also demanded that Zarrab be freed. Speculation about a Zarrab plea deal intensified over the summer amid news reports that special counsel Robert Mueller was scrutinizing former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn over his undisclosed lobbying work for the government of Turkey. Among other things, Flynn had written an editorial, published on election day, urging the U.S. to extradite Gulen. Zarrab was charged in the U.S. with conspiring to help the Iranian government and Halkbank make hundreds of millions of dollars in financial transactions that violated U.S. sanctions. Some of the transactions were made through U.S. financial institutions, investigators said, clearing the way for a prosecution in New York. By TOM HAYS and LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press",1

1243,"LAS VEGAS — A Las Vegas federal judge set bail of $30,000 for a celebrated young British cybersecurity researcher — and surfer — accused by federal prosecutors of creating and distributing malicious software designed to steal banking passwords. The attorney for Marcus Hutchins, who has broad support in the information-security community, said the 23-year-old hacker would contest the charges. She said he would not be released until Monday because there wasnt enough time to post bail after Fridays afternoon ruling. Hutchins is due in federal court in Milwaukee on Tuesday. The U.K. resident gained overnight fame with quick thinking in May when he helped curb the spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack that had crippled thousands of computers worldwide. (For more information on this and other neighborhood stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) Much of the cybersecurity community rallied around Hutchins after his arrest Wednesday, calling him a principled, ethical hacker. The conditions of his release came as a relief for his supporters. This is excellent news, said Nicholas Weaver, a computer scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. The indictment is remarkably shallow even by indictment standards, which is disappointing because it adds considerable uncertainty and fosters distrust with the general security community. Las Vegas-based attorney Adrian Lobo said money for Hutchins bond would come from a variety of supporters and family in the U.S. and abroad. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital leading civil liberties non-profit, said it helped arrange Hutchins counsel and was working to find him an attorney to provide the best possible defense. Security researchers are vital to protecting the computers we rely upon every day, EFF general counsel Kurt Opsahl said via email. Mr. Hutchins arrest has unfortunately deepened the divide between the research community and the government. Weaver said federal prosecutors and the FBI were making a mistake by not providing more details about the crimes it alleges Hutchins committed. Having more information would act to reassure the larger security community, he said. At the hearing, assistant U.S. attorney Dan Cowhig said Hutchins admitted to authorities in an interview following his arrest that he was the author of the malware code and sold it. He said the government has evidence of chat logs in which Hutchins discussed with an associate the sale of the Kronos banking Trojan. Magistrate Judge Nancy Koppe said Hutchins is not a danger to the community and has sufficient community support to not be a flight risk. She ordered him to surrender his passport and said he could fly to Wisconsin, where he was indicted last month, without identification. The most recent charge in the indictment is in July of 2015. Thats two years ago that the defendant has been free to roam the world during that period of time, she said. Hutchins did not enter a plea at Fridays hearing. He was arrested while preparing to return home from the Def Con convention for computer security professionals. He stands accused of creating and distributing malware known as the Kronos banking Trojan. Such malware infects web browsers, then captures usernames and passwords when an unsuspecting user visits a bank or other trusted location, enabling cybertheft. Computer law expert Tor Ekeland described the evidence so in the case far as flimsy. This is a very, very problematic prosecution to my mind, and I think its bizarre that the United States government has chosen to prosecute somebody whos arguably their hero in the WannaCry malware attack and potentially saved lives and thousands, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars over the sale of alleged malware, Ekeland said. The indictment alleges that Hutchins and another defendant — whose name was redacted — conspired between July 2014 and July 2015 to advertise the availability of the Kronos malware on internet forums, sell the malware and profit from it. The indictment also accuses Hutchins of creating the malware. Programs, however, can often include code written by multiple programmers. Prosecutors might need to prove that Hutchins wrote code that targeted specific institutions. U.S. Justice Department officials on Friday declined to answers questions about the case. The FBIs Milwaukee field office, which led the 2-year investigation, didnt return requests for comment. Ekeland said that what is notable to him from the indictment is that it doesnt allege any financial loss to any victims — or in any way identify them. Besides that, laws covering aspects of computer crime are unclear, often giving prosecutors broad discretion. The only money mentioned in this indictment is ... for the sale of the software, he said. Jake Williams, a respected cybersecurity researcher, said he found it difficult to believe Hutchins is guilty. The two men have worked together on various projects, including training material for higher education for which the Briton declined payment. Hutchins lives with his family in the town of Ilfracombe, England, and worked out of his bedroom. His mother, Janet, who has been frantically trying to reach her son, said she was outraged by the arrest and that it was hugely unlikely her son was involved because he spends much of his time combatting such attacks. Back in May, the curly-haired computer whiz and surfing enthusiast discovered a so-called kill switch that slowed the unprecedented WannaCry outbreak. He then spent the next three days fighting the worm that crippled Britains hospital network as well as factories, government agencies, banks and other businesses around the world. Though he had always worked under the moniker of MalwareTech, cracking WannaCry led to the loss of his anonymity and propelled him to cyber stardom. There were appearances and a $10,000 prize for cracking WannaCry. He planned to donate the money to charity. I dont think Im ever going back to the MalwareTech that everyone knew, he told The Associated Press at the time.

1244,"- A 21-year-old man pleaded guilty Thursday to an aggravated kidnapping charge for coercing a 13-year-old girl out of her bedroom and then sexually assaulting her, prosecutors said Thursday. Ericsson Gumesindo could now face between 6 and 30 years in prison when he is sentenced on June 6. The charge stems from a call made to the Woodstock Police Department by a concerned father in July 2014, according to a news release from the McHenry County States Attorneys Office. The early morning call came after the father realized his 13-year-old girl was missing from their home. When police arrived, Gumesindo pulled up in a stolen vehicle with the missing child in the passenger seat, according to authorities. An investigation revealed Gumesindo broke a window to the home woke up the teenage girl and coerced her to go with him by lying and telling the victim that her sister was lost, according to the news release. Gumesindo then took the victim in a vehicle he had stolen the day before to a park and sexually assaulted her. As part of his sentence, Gumesindo will be required to register as a sex offender for life, prosecutors said.",1
1245,"Police tracked down and arrested a woman who reportedly tried to kidnap a toddler. Mountain View police worked on the case nonstop through the night following the incident reported at 4 p.m. Wednesday, MVPD officials said in a news release. Officers were told when they responded to the attempted kidnapping that a woman wearing a mask approached a grandmother, her daughter and her grandchild and told them she was there to take the toddler, MVPD Spokeswoman Katie Nelson said. As the masked woman reached for the baby the grandmother intervened but was hit on the head by the suspect, leaving the grandmother injured, Nelson said. Police were told the suspect then threatened the childs mother before driving away in a Toyota Camry. The child was not taken, nor was the toddler harmed in the attempted kidnapping, Nelson said. The childs mother was also not injured. It does not appear that the suspect and the victims knew one another. Officers searched the neighborhood for the suspect but did not immediately locate her. Using extremely detailed descriptions of both the suspect and her vehicle, Nelson said the suspect, later identified as 31-year-old Schauntel Gomez, was arrested within hours. Patrol officers spotted the suspect vehicle at about 2 a.m. Thursday in the Shell gas station parking lot at Rengstorff Avenue and Central Expressway. Nelson said the officers conducted a high-risk traffic stop and detained Gomez, a transient, without incident. Inside Gomezs car, Nelson said, was a white mask consistent with the one the victims described her wearing when she attempted to take the child. Officers also found drug paraphernalia and mail and packages from the area in her car, Nelson alleged. Gomez was booked into a Santa Clara County jail on suspicion of attempted kidnapping, criminal threats, battery and possession of drug paraphernalia. She was being held in lieu of $81,000 Friday at Elmwood Womens Correctional facility, records showed. We were moments away from a potential tragedy involving an innocent child, and an at-large suspect capable such a heinous act was very concerning, said Mountain View police Chief Max Bosel. Im incredibly thankful that the child was not hurt, that the mother quickly notified us, and I am very proud of the teamwork and tenacity of Mountain Views patrol officers and detectives that led to this case being resolved within hours of its report.

1246,"A woman who allegedly tried to kidnap two children in Glendale earlier this week was arrested today, police said. Lisa Arnold, 52, of Glendale, was taken into custody about 2:30 a.m., said Glendale police Sgt. Robert William. Detectives have been working through the night conducting interviews and search warrants, William said. This investigation is still very active and detectives are working to determine a motive, William said. At this time, the Glendale Police Department is not looking for any other suspects. Wednesdays two incidents occurred within 25 minutes and less than a mile away from each other, William said. The first incident occurred at 5:11 p.m. Wednesday at the intersection of Chevy Chase Drive and Adams Street. Police said a mother was walking her infant child in a stroller when she was approached by a suspect who grabbed the child out of the stroller and attempted to flee. The mother struggled over her baby and was able to get the child back before the suspect fled the scene in a small white or silver compact car, police said. The second incident occurred at 5:35 p.m. just outside the John Marshall Elementary School campus located at 1201 E. Broadway, at the intersection of Chevy Chase Drive and Broadway. An 8-year-old child reported to a 911 operator that someone tried to steal his 2-year-old brother, police said. In this incident, the mother was standing nearby and was able to stop the kidnapping. The suspect fled in a small, four-door silver sedan. The 8-year-old witness described the suspect as a man who was dressed like a woman, and the childs mother described the suspect as a male in his late 40s or 50s with salt-and-pepper hair and a two-day-old beard, police said. She also told police the suspect was dressed in a gray shirt with a multi-colored design on the front. The suspect in both incidents also called the children cute before attempting to take them, William said. Anyone with information about the attempted kidnappings is urged to call (818) 548-4911. — City News Service",0
1247,"A 50-year-old Napa man was arrested early Saturday morning after he allegedly drugged, raped and kidnapped a 13-year-old girl, according to the Sonoma County Sheriffs office. Sheriffs officials said deputies responded to state Highway 1 at South Harbour Way in Bodega Bay around 5:40 a.m. after a man called stating his 13-year-old companion had jumped out of his moving vehicle. Upon arrival, deputies were speaking with the caller, Timothy Lee Marble of Napa, when the girl came out of the bushes covered with scrapes and road rash. Sheriffs officials said the girl told deputies Marble had raped her. Marble was detained and the girl was taken to a hospital in an ambulance. Deputies were able to reach the victims mother and learned that the girl had ran away from her Napa home Thursday night after the two had an argument. About 3 a.m. Friday morning, the victim was at a Shell gas station in Napa when she met Marble who offered to give her a ride in his red Chevy pickup, according to the sheriffs office. Marble drove them somewhere in the countryside where they smoked marijuana together, and he allegedly made several sexual advances toward the victim. Sheriffs officials said when the girl rejected Marbles advances, he tied her to a tree before sexually assaulting her. He then allegedly convinced the girl to use methamphetamine, and used a syringe to inject her with the drug. The sheriffs office said that at one point Marble used a razor blade and a knife to make small cuts to the victims legs. He also carved his name into her skin using the knife, which was still visible when she was found. Marble allegedly assaulted the girl two more times while they were in his truck. According to the sheriffs office, Marble was on his way to Bodega Bay early Saturday morning when the girl, fearing for her life, jumped from the moving truck. He stopped his vehicle and called out for the girl, allegedly threatening to kill her if she didnt answer, before eventually calling the police. After an investigation, detectives from the sheriffs office arrested Marble, who has a long criminal history, on suspicion of numerous counts of sexual acts with a minor, kidnapping and child abuse. He was booked into the Sonoma County Jail and is being held without bail. --Bay City News contributed to this report/Image via Sonoma Sheriff",1
1248,"When Lacey police responded to a Caldwell Avenue home on June 12 after a man reported being kidnapped, the victim was not there, Police Chief Michael C. DiBella said. But he showed up at the police department shortly after and told police he had been assaulted and kidnapped in Seaside Heights. The man had extensive injuries, including broken bones in his face and leg. He told police he was assaulted while he waited in a car for a female companion, the chief said. The suspect reportedly entered the vehicle striking the victim numerous times and then forcing him into his (suspect) vehicle, DiBella said. The victim was continually assaulted as the suspect drove him to Forked River, where he eventually escaped from the car. Police have not released the name of the victim. After a lengthy investigation, officers from the Ocean County Sheriffs Department and U.S. Marshals Office located Kevin Johnson, 52, East Main Street, Tuckerton, at a Toms River home on July 27.

1250,"A jury has recommended the death penalty for Steven Dean Gordon,who was convicted of killing four prostitutes in Orange County. Jurors selected capital punishment over life in prison without the possibility of parole for the defendant, who represented himself at his trial in Santa Ana. Earlier on Wednesday, after questioning the juror about whether she had declared that she could not recommend the death penalty for any defendant, unless perhaps the victims were babies, Judge Patrick Donahue indicated he was about to release the woman. But another several minutes in deliberations with the rest of the jury while Donahue discussed what to do with the prosecutor and defendant Steven Dean Gordon, the jury announced it had reached a verdict that will be announced this afternoon. Jurors began deliberations Tuesday afternoon on whether to recommend the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole. Gordon, 47, who is representing himself without an attorney, wanted the woman booted from the jury. I think if she stayed and with the other 11 voted death, the case is going to be overturned and I dont want that. I think you need to remove her, Gordon said. Senior Deputy District Attorney Larry Yellin said, I agree (with Donahue) that shes not deliberating and following the law. The prosecutor said the panelists comment that she thought at one point that she could only support the death penalty for killers of children was disingenuous and showed that she was not considering the evidence in this case. Donahue brought the juror back out alone and asked her if she felt intimidated by him or bullied by the judge or other jurors. She said no. Then, after sending the jury to lunch, Donahue said, I had pretty much made up my mind to boot the woman from the jury.But in the last five or 10 minutes, she mustve decided she would fulfill her obligations as a juror. On Tuesday, Gordon argued that he fought for the right to defend himself so he could get the trial done more quickly. Not once did I say to Mr. Yellin or (Anaheim police Detective Julissa) Trapp that Im going to ask the jury to spare my life, and Im still not going to, Gordon said. Thats your decision... (But) if you kill four people like this in cold blood you deserve to die. I believe that. Gordon also offered apologies to the family members of the victims. Nobody knows how I feel inside, Gordon said. Truthfully, it is very hard knowing I caused all this pain to four families. It wont change anything, and it wont bring them back. My actions were evil and horrible and youre going to get your justice very shortly. Gordon said he complained numerous times about the delays in going to trial. It has nothing to do with my attorney, Gordon said of his previously court-appointed legal representative. It was my decision to get this over with and get out of here. Gordon said he called parole and probation officials to testify in the trial because he wanted them to shoulder blame for the killings. I have no defense, Gordon said of his crimes. I put people up there who are as responsible as me and my co-defendant... I was attacking them because they didnt do their job. Parole and probation officials came under fire when Gordon and his co- defendant Franc Cano, another registered sex offender, were arrested because it appeared they were socializing together, which would be against the rules. I never said it was OK, Gordon said of his spending time with Cano. They gave us permission. The other 11 jurors told Donahue that the holdout declared within 15 to 30 minutes of the start of deliberations that she could not vote for death under any circumstances. Then, this morning, she said she might be able to if the victims were infants or babies. Finally, she told Donahue she wasnt sure of her position on the issue, and then after rejoining the panel several minutes later, the jury announced it had reached a verdict. Gordon, who was convicted Thursday, admitted his involvement in most of the abduction murders, although he insisted Cano, 30, was the main culprit in hunting down and killing the four victims. Yellin argued last week that Gordon was the manipulator and the big brother in the relationship between the convicted sex offenders. Gordon was convicted of murdering 21-year-old Jarrae Nykkole Estepp, 20- year-old Kianna Jackson, 34-year-old Josephine Vargas and 28-year-old Martha Anaya. Only Estepps body was found. That discovery led to multiple clues tying Gordon and Cano to the other killings, with Yellin making his case on evidence from DNA, GPS-tracked movements of both defendants and their own statements to police.

Officers spoke with the woman, who said that she had not taken anything. She opened a bag she had been carrying so police could check, revealing no clothing to be inside. Officers spoke with staff, who said the woman had been in the store on a previous occasion and that she had allegedly assaulted an employee, though she had not taken anything that day. The woman did not have identification on her; police subsequently told her not to return to Old Navy. At 5 p.m., police responded to the Motherbrook apartment complex on North Stone Mill Drive on a report of two bicycles in the river. Upon arrival, officers found the bikes, which appeared to be abandoned. Police searched the area for anyone who may have fallen into the river or in distress, but were not able to locate anyone. The Dedham Fire Department then sent firefighters to retrieve the bikes, which were transported back to the Dedham Police Department and placed in storage. One of the bikes was described as a silver Mongoose Rebel, the other being a silver and black Mongoose XTZ2 (21-speed) bike. Thursday, Oct. 23 At 11:59 a.m., police received a report of a phone scam, during which a resident reported receiving several calls from a person claiming to work for Publishers Clearing House and said that the resident had won more than $500,000, but to obtain the money she would need to forward $700 to a Bank of America account. The resident reportedly knew the call had been a scam, but was able to keep the person on the phone to try to get more information. Police told her that, should the person call her again, she should inform him that the police have been notified. At 12:27 p.m., police responded to a report of a fight in progress at Citizens Bank in Legacy Place. Officers spoke with two individuals, one of whom said that while stepping off a sidewalk, a driver accidentally ran over his foot, and a verbal argument ensued.

Sunday, Oct. 26 At 3:23 p.m, police responded to the area of Fisher and Ames streets on a report of a suspicious person who had been collecting wood from a pile left by NSTAR, which had been doing work in the area. Officers located a stack of wood that was strapped together and other parts used by NSTAR for the project. Police were able to contact the individual, who reportedly admitted that he had taken wood, thinking it was left behind and free for the taking. Police informed the man that he would have to return the wood to the area and ask NSTAR if he would have permission to take it. The man said he would return the wood immediately.",0
1252,"Filmmaker David Beilinson shuddered a bit at the timing – first last summer when Evansdale cousins Lyric Cook-Morrissey and Elizabeth Collins disappeared, and then again over a week ago when their bodies were found by hunters in northeast Iowa.When the Evansale cousins vanished, Beilinson and his film crew were in Iowa interviewing West Des Moines mom Noreen Gosch for a documentary on her 30-year search for answers about the disappearance of her son, Johnny, who never came home from his morning paper route on Sept. 5, 1982. The film, Missing Johnny, premieres Sunday, Dec. 16, on MSNBCs Maximum Drama program. It airs at 8 p.m. CST.When the cousins bodies were discovered, Beilinson was again focused on the Gosch case and was contacting media for the one-hour documentary. In a news release, Beilinson and his Rumur Inc. co-producers – Suki Hawley and Michael Galinski – said the one-hour program chronicles the endless intrigue and conspiracy theories surrounding the eyewitness sightings, physical evidence and case-turning discoveries which span across three decades.Besides Noreen Gosch, those interviewed included her former husband and Johnnys father John Gosch Sr., convicted child molester Paul Bonacci (who confirmed his role in Johnnys abduction), West Des Moines Police Lt. Cam Coppess, retired police Capt. Bob Rushing, and Eileen Wixted and Frank Santiago, reporters for WHO-TV and the Des Moines Register, respectively, who covered the then 12-year-olds disappearance.Beilinson said in an interview with Patch that he and his co-producers have been aware of the Gosch case for about a decade and view it as a watershed case that changed how law enforcement officials respond to reports of missing children.For example: Delving into the various aspects of the story, Beilinson said he and his colleagues experienced a range of emotions, from being sad, angry and inspired by Noreen and inspired by the comradery of people who helped in the beginning.Beilinson called Noreen Gosch an amazing character who has been judged unfairly.It was kind of a, I feel bad for her, but jeez, does she have to go on the media all the time?  Beilinson said. I think they wanted her to be quiet and go away. Its much easier to deal with murders and out-there crimes than sexually exploited children, and she felt the brunt of that.One of the biggest surprises was that since the 1980s, big media stories about human trafficking and child prostitution are rare. People think of it as a problem from the 80s and not something that happens now, he said.A second installment of Missing Johnny may air within six months on MSNBCs Maximum Drama, which takes viewers to places that are considered off limits and out of bounds, Beilinson said.Other investigations this season have resulted in stories such as Sex Slaves: Chicago and Ted Bundys Death Row Tapes._________________________In September, Patchs Iowas Missing Kids project traced Noreen Goschs 30-year journey to find her son.

1259,"A man fearful of going to jail is now in jail after leading police on a wild high-speed chase late Friday afternoon that forced several vehicles to drive into ditches to avoid a head-on collision, according to the Stafford County Sheriffs Office. Michael Harless, 35, of Brookfield Drive in Catlett, was charged with eluding police, two counts of abduction and kidnapping, felony hit and run, driving under the influence, reckless driving, possessing a vehicle with an altered serial number, resisting arrest, driving with a suspended or revoked license and numerous other misdemeanors. Hes being held without bond. Shortly after 4:30 p.m., police responded to a report from a witness who saw a white male urinating behind a business on Garrisonville Road and then throwing beer cans out of his blue Chevrolet Silverado while driving into Doc Stone Commons. The witness said Harless ran a red light and drove over several curbs before stopping at Lowes, where two men got out of the truck, went into the store, picked up another man and then headed west on Route 610. Police caught up with the truck as it turned left into a North Stafford High School parking lot, but Harless refused to pull over and instead headed south on Shelton Shop Road. The truck slowed as it approached the intersection of Mountain View Road and then briefly stopped at the traffic light. Thats when the two passengers bailed and were ordered to the ground by police, but Harless took off again, this time going east on Mountain View Road at speeds from 60-80 mph. Thats when several vehicles drove into ditches to avoid being hit. The two passengers told police they begged Harless to pull over but he replied that he was wanted and had eight years to serve. So now solo, he turned onto Centreport Parkway heading toward I-95 but police ahead deployed stop sticks, which punctured both the driver and passenger side tires. Harless kept going, despite losing tire tread and slowing, He finally was stopped when a rolling road block pinned him against a guard rail on Route 1. But the pursuit didnt end there. Harless got out of the truck and fled on foot but a police dog brought him down. He was handcuffed, resisting all the while, and then led to an awaiting patrol car. But the pursuit didnt end there, either. Harless broke free and fled again before being subdued and taken to a local hospital for treatment of injuries he received during the pursuit. And then? Jail.

1261,"- Two men who pleaded guilty to a 2015 home invasion in South Nashville will spend the next 15 years in prison. Robert Corder and Oscar Burnett-Patton pleaded guilty to aggravated kidnapping in the September 2015 Trousdale Drive home invasion. The pair busted into the home, held the occupants - a 51-year-old woman, her 72-year-old mother, 26-year-old daughter and her 26-year-old boyfriend - at gunpoint and ransacked the house before taking the residents to a nearby ATM and forcing them to withdraw money. Investigators say the men left the family inside their cars when they fled, but the 26-year-old woman memorized the plate numbers, which helped police track down the perpetrators. We appreciate the victims courage, determination and patience throughout this process, Assistant District Attorney Paul DeWitt said. We hope this guilty plea gives the family the justice they deserved. Photos via Metro Nashville Police",1

1263,"Convicted serial killer Oscar Ray Bolins lawyers arent giving up on their fight to spare their client from execution. A request for a stay was filed with the Florida Supreme Court on Tuesday. Bolins initial appeal to the Florida Supreme Court was denied last week. Lawyers intended to present alleged new evidence that an Ohio inmate confessed to the murder of Teri Lynn Matthews. The states highest court denied that request, saying there wasnt enough evidence to substantiate the claim. In the latest stay of execution request, Bolins attorneys say they need time to file a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their clients case. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondis office filed a response Wednesday. The state is asking the court to deny the stay. While convicted in a string of murders in the Tampa Bay area in the 1980s, Bolins appeal centers Matthews death in December 1986. See Also: Matthews, 26, was abducted from the Land O Lakes Post Office on U.S. 41. Her death rocked the community and left many on edge. Bolin was also sentenced to death in the Carrollwood murder of Stephanie Collins in 1986. Collins was abducted from a shopping plaza. The Chamberlain High School student was 17. Bolin was also convicted in the January 1986 slaying of Natalie Blanch Holley in Hillsborough County. Bolin, who was once a carnival worker and long-haul trucker, is suspected in a number of other murders across the country. It is unclear when the state court will take up the stay request. As of Wednesday, Bolins execution was still scheduled for 6 p.m. on Jan. 7, according to Florida Supreme Court records.  Photo of Oscar Ray Bolin courtesy of the Florida Department of Corrections",1
1264,"Jurors have reached a verdict in the case of four grisly murders of Santa Ana prostitutes. Serial killer Steven Dean Gordon, 47 admitted to killing two prostitutes, hinted at his guilt in the murder of a third but denied a fourth murder in a bizarre Orange County trial. Gordon, who is acting as his own attorney in his death-penalty trial, argued that his co-defendant, Franc Cano, 30, was the main culprit in hunting down and killing the four victims. Senior Deputy District Attorney Larry Yellin, however, argued that Gordon was the manipulator and the big brother in the relationship between the convicted sex offenders. Now, Gordon will shift to penalty phase, during which jurors will recommend either the death penalty or life in prison without parole. Cano is currently awaiting trial. In his closing argument, Gordon did not deny many of the allegations, but he argued he was not guilty of attacking and killing 21-year-old Jarrae Nykkole Estepp. Gordon and Cano, who will be tried separately and also faces the death penalty, are also charged with killing 20-year-old Kianna Jackson, 34-year-old Josephine Vargas and 28-year-old Martha Anaya. Only Estepps body was found. That discovery led to multiple clues tying Gordon and Cano to the other killings, with Yellin making his case on evidence from DNA, GPS-tracked movements of both defendants and their own statements to police. Referring to Yellins opening statement of the trial, Gordon told jurors, Everything he said is 100 percent on target. I even complimented him after you (the jurors) left. He brought his A game. While discussing the killing of Jackson, who went missing on Oct. 6, 2013, Gordon said, Franc and I went down to Santa Ana to pick up working girls. Not to kidnap or murder, but things escalated out of control, which led to the death of (Jackson) before her time. The next victim, Vargas, who was reported missing Oct. 24, 2013, became a target of the defendants, Gordon said. Yes, Franc and I went to Santa Ana to commit a murder and kidnapping, which led to the death (of Vargas) before her time, Gordon said. Anaya, who went missing Nov. 12, 2013, was just a target of Canos, Gordon said. Franc Cano went to Santa Ana (that night) to commit a rape and murder all by himself, Gordon said.Gordon argued, You cant prove I was there, because he claimed he was not wearing a GPS tracking device at that time. Probation and parole officials came under fire in the case because the two defendants, who actually cut off their devices and left the state at one point, were supposed to be monitored, but authorities did not seem to notice they were associating with each other, which is typically a violation. Gordon claimed that someday the truth will come out that they had permission to hang around with each other. As for Estepps killing, Gordon said, Yes, we went down to look for a girl to kidnap and murder. Yes, on the drive back I had a change of heart on killing her. Gordon said, however, he could not stop his partner and that, I failed her. Referring to testimony from a coroner that Estepps attacker stomped on her neck, Gordon said, It wasnt me... I didnt stomp on Jarraes neck. ... I saw what he did to her. I watched it. Gordon also argued that Cano tried to set him up by using his phone to send incriminating text messages to Canos phone. He knew of my intent of letting her go, thats my belief, Gordon said. I could have blamed him (Cano) for everything, Gordon said. Our intent on these nights were beyond evil, the defendant added. No doubt about it. Yes, I changed my mind about killing (Estepp), but it doesnt matter because I (screwed) up. Yellin told jurors no one will ever truly know what happened when the victims were attacked. The details of who was driving and who was in the back seat hiding when they picked up prostitutes and ambushed them will remain in dispute, Yellin said. But he said it doesnt matter under the legal theories the jury must consider to weigh Gordons guilt. The defendant can be convicted either as a conspirator or as an accomplice in the kidnappings and murders, Yellin said. A killing resulting from a kidnapping is automatically murder, Yellin argued. Jurors can also consider second-degree murder if they rule out first- degree murder, but Yellin argued all the evidence of premeditation and deliberation needed to prove first-degree murder was present in the killings.Yellin pointed out the two were so savvy about their restrictions as sex offenders that they avoided straying too far from areas they were allowed to visit, to prevent the GPS-tracking devices from being triggered. There was also evidence they used hoses at the auto body shop where they took their victims to wash evidence from the bodies, Yellin said. Yellin brushed off Gordons arguments on the mistakes authorities made in tracking the sex offenders as white noise that was irrelevant to the decisions jurors must make. At the beginning of the trial, Yellin compared the Gordon and Cano to the sharks in Jaws, but in his closing argument, Yellin said that was an insult to the sharks. These guys not only did horrible things -- killing, multiple sexual assaults -- they also psychologically terrorized (the victims). They gave them hope, if you just do this well let you go, the prosecutor said.Jurors will deliberate on four charges of murder with special circumstances of murdering during a kidnapping and multiple murders. If jurors find Gordon guilty, the trial will shift to a penalty phase, in which the panel will consider whether to recommend death or life in prison without the possibility of parole.

1265,"A jury has convicted a man of multiple counts of sexual assault, including rape, sodomy and oral copulation all by force, the Monterey County District Attorneys Office announced Tuesday. Prosecutors said that Salinas resident Jimmy Alexander was also convicted of kidnapping and robbery. On April 15 and 16, a female victim was in the Chinatown area of Salinas when Alexander got into her car and ordered her to drive away. Over the next eight hours they drove to several locations and Alexander sexually assaulted the victim, prosecutors said. The victim eventually convinced Alexander to get out of her car, prosecutors said. According to prosecutors, a sentencing date has not yet been set because the judge is considering evidence to determine if Alexander has a prior conviction under Californias three strikes law.

1266,"For 15 years, the case was cold. The victim, the owner of a popular Ramsey pizzeria, was tied up in his home. Three armed men stole between $100,000 and $200,000 from a safe. The 2003 case went cold until June 16 when the Bergen County Sheriffs Department contacted Mahwah Police Detective Sgt. Kevin Hebert about a positive match to DNA found on a costume mask that was found at the Indian Field Court crime scene, along with a .22-caliber handgun, which were left at the house, Mahwah Police Chief James Batelli. The DNA belonged to Paul Shkreli, 45, of Yonkers, New York. Hebert determined that Shkreli was the building superintendent for an apartment complex in Mahwah when the robbery occurred. The complex was a short walk from the victims home and near the pizzeria in Ramsey, Batelli said. Police investigated and a warrant was issued for Shkreli, who was incarcerated in the Westchester County Jail in New York on other charges, the chief said. Shkreli was charged with kidnapping, robbery, armed burglary, theft of more than $75,000, possession of a weapon and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes. Shkreli is awaiting extradition to New Jersey on the charges once he completes his jail term in New York. Shkreli and the other suspects entered the home through a basement window, tied him up, and demanded to know where the safe was and where money was hidden, Batelli said. The suspects tied the victim to a chair. He gave them $15,000, but they demanded more money and threatened to harm him until he told them where it was, Batelli said. The home was ransacked until the money was found. Shkreli led New York State and local police on a high-speed chase after authorities tried to stop him in Bedford, New York in 2004. Authorities believed he was part of a burglary ring. The vehicle became disabled and Shkreli fled on foot. He was later arrested, Batelli said. Shkreli was arrested in 2017 after he tried to break into a Yorktown, New York jewelry store, the chief said. He was charged with burglary. Batelli said Shkreli is a suspect in two other burglaries to the same residence Shkreli allegedly broke into in 2003. The Mahwah Detective Bureau is already working on information and is confident that the other robberies will be solved and the additional suspects will be identified, charged, and arrested in the near future, Batelli said.

Stephen Lyon, 26, of Alpharetta, is currently charged with felony aggravated assault with attempt to rape and simple battery, said Forsyth County Sheriffs Office spokesman Epifanio Rodriguez. Detectives tied Lyon to two recent incidents in which women were grabbed and had their clothing pulled at. One happened at The Collection shopping center and the other at the Publix grocery store on Mathis Airport Road. Rodriguez noted that inaccurate reports were circulating on social media saying the two incidents were attempted abductions. Neither woman felt she was being abducted, he said. Investigators say they also were able to link Lyon to a February assault at a south Forsyth tanning salon.

1275,"A Detroit toddler was found safe inside a vehicle parked at an abandoned house on the 1900 block of Biltmore Street, about four miles from where he was allegedly kidnapped Thursday morning, and his alleged abductor has been arrested, according to multiple media reports. Michael Grayson, 19, is accused of kidnapping Marvie Gardner, 3, from a home on the 19300 block of Winston Street, near Telegraph Road and Grand River Avenue. Its unclear how the boy ended up in the vehicle, and whether Grayson had been driving it. Grayson and his girlfriend had been visiting the home with their child, according to police.

Spears reported her son missing about 5:30 a.m. Thursday after walking up to find he wasnt sleeping next to her, nor was he anywhere in the house. The Detroit Free Press reported that Marvies mother, Latoya Spears, found a note that read: Get my baby!! Will contact. Done playn Lets play. While her son was still missing, Spears told the Detroit Free Press that she had a message for Grayson: Michael, I promise you, do not hurt my baby, You need to return him now. ...

1276,"By Caitlin Brown (Patch Staff) A 21-year-old Connecticut resident has been arrested and federally charged for his involvement in a swatting ring, which affected two Monmouth County schools in January of this year, according to authorities. Matthew Tollis, of Wethersfield, was first arrested in connection to an April 2014 bomb threat made to the University of Connecticut and is now facing additional charges for his involvement with the swatting ring, who call themselves TCOD, or Team Crucifix or Die, according to the FBI. They comprise mostly Microsoft X-Box gamers, including three residents of the UK who are also being investigated by the FBI. An ongoing investigation by the FBI revealed that Tollis, in connection with TCOD, engaged in swatting threats to schools and other locations in New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, and Texas, including Saint John Vianney in Holmdel, and Allenwood High School in Upper Freehold, according to court documents from the United States Attorneys Office in the District of Connecticut. Swatting is the act of calling in a hoax 9-1-1 call or emergency call, in order to cause a response from emergency services, such as SWAT teams and other law enforcement groups. Many celebrities became the victims of swatting calls throughout 2014 as the hoax became an unfortunate trend among pranksters. These calls are made to seem as if they are coming from the victims phone, causing an otherwise harmless prank to become, usually, a large scale response from law enforcement agencies that are required by protocol to talk the calls of this nature very seriously. The swatting event is a major inconvenience for both the victim targets of the calls as well as the agencies forced to respond, who waste valuable time, resources, and manpower on the fake threats. On January 15, 2014, the Holmdel Police Department was swatted when a call was made to the department at approximately 11:40 a.m. from what was later determined to be a Skype default telephone number. According to the court affidavit, the person who called the Holmdel Police Department stated that he was at the St. John Yianney High School in Homdel, and that a masked man had grabbed him in the bathroom. According to the caller, the masked man threatened to blow up the school, and was armed with a pistol. The caller also stated that the masked man stated that he had sarin gas. The caller stated that he ran out of the high school, and then called Holmdel police. Holmdel Police immediately responded to St. John Vianney High School to evacuate the school and place it in lock down. Each room was searched and cleared by police, and over 1,000 students, faculty, and staff were instructed to exit the school at the rear of the building to St. Benedicts Church. The search for the suspect and evacuation was conducted by multiple agencies, including the Holmdel, Hazlet and Matawan police departments, the FBI, the Monmouth County Sheriffs Department, the New Jersey State Police, and the Monmouth County Emergency Response Team. The Monmouth County K-9 Explosive Detection Unit also responded to the scene, and determined that there were no explosive devices. After conducting a sweep of the school two times, it was determined that there were no weapons, explosive devices, or a masked and armed man, and the school was cleared to reopen at 2:45 p.m. It was an unsubstantiated threat and appears to be a hoax, Acting-Monmouth County Prosecutor Chris Gramiccioni said at the time. A lengthy investigation was then conducted by Detective Andrew Kret and the Holmdel Police Department, in conjunction with the Monmouth County Prosecutors Office and the FBI Office out of Newark. Based on information obtained during the investigation, law enforcement was able to determine the account name tied to the Skype call. Further investigation found that on the day of the bomb threat, a Twitter user tweeted information and photographs of the law enforcement response and evacuation of St. John Vianney High School to another Twitter Account, from which the user then tweeted that they were responsible for the Saint John Vianney bomb threat hoax. The FBIs analysis of the photographs in the tweets revealed that the account holder was a juvenile student who attended St. John Vianney High School at the time of the incident. The FBI reviewed the tweets between the two Twitter accounts, and determined that the minor student had spoken on Twitter with the second Twitter user, who told the minor student that he was going to call in a hoax at St. John Vianney High School that would result in a SWAT team being sent there. According to court documents, Tollis stated that he had seen a screenshot of messages between the two Twitter users that the student had paid the prankster for the hoax call, but was not able to say whether a payment had actually been made or not. Tollis admitted to investigators that he had taken part in the hoax call, but that he never spoke during the Saint John Vianney swatting call and just laughed in the background of the call. The 15-year-old student was later arrested on August 20 by the Holmdel Police Department, and charged with Creating a False Public Alarm and Terroristic Threats. When contacted by Patch after the arrest, Holmdel Police Lt. Keith Cannata declined to reveal whether the juvenile was a Holmdel resident. The suspect was charged at police headquarters and then released to his parents. The case was then sent to the Monmouth County Prosecutors Office for review. Based on information received by Twitter, authorities were able to determine that the Twitter user who claimed responsibility for the call and the Skype account used to make the call both had the same IP Address. Tollis had also made claims to investigators that both users were the same person. On January 16, 2014 a threat to the Upper Freehold Regional School District was made by a male caller, claiming a bomb had been placed in the bathroom of a school, but the caller did not specify which school. The school district, including Allentown Regional High School (ARHS), is a kindergarten through 12th grade school district comprising of over 3,000 students, and the New Jersey State Police were forced to order the entire school system to be evacuated. Because the two swatting calls were made back to back between January 15 and January 16, the NJ State Police, the FBI, and the Holmdel Police Department were able to quickly determine that the two calls were related, and began an investigation into linking the information from the Saint John Vianney hoaxer with the Allentown swatter. Tollis told investigators that he was aware that the Upper Freehold swatting call would take place in advance, and also admitted to participating in the second call as well. Tollis explained to investigators that the Twitter user, a member of the TCOD gaming group, would post online their availability to make swat calls to schools throughout the country, and then other members of the TCOD group would request to take part in the Skype calls by being added to the line. Further investigation has revealed that Tollis, in conjunction with TCOD, were responsible for making swat calls involving bomb threats, hostage taking, firearms, and mass murder, according to the criminal complaint. Tollis was identified by the FBI and admitted to his part in at least six swatting incidents, including the SJV, Upper Freehold School District, and UCONN bomb threats Tollis stated in his confession that he met members of TCOD online and became involved with the gaming group after being bullied.

1278,"The Damascus man facing murder charges for allegedly killing his pregnant girlfriend said he shot her in the head because he was afraid he buried her alive after she struck her head on a porch post, according to reports. Tyler Tessier, 33, was charged with first-degree murder for the death of Laura Wallen, 31, who was a teacher at Wilde Lake High School in Columbia. The disappearance of 31-year-old Wallen, who lived in a condo on Rolling Meadows Way in Olney, prompted a search that was widely publicized last September. She was four months pregnant when she was reported missing on Sept. 4, 2017. Her body was found in a shallow grave in a field in Damascus on Sept. 13. In prosecution filing obtained by WTOP, Tessier admitted to helping Ms. Wallen disappear. Wallen was allegedly upset because she was having another mans baby and she was worried she would lose her teaching job, WTOP reports. Tessier told detectives this was all done at Ms. Wallens insistence because she needed to disappear, assistant prosecutor Donna Fenton wrote in filings. Court filings show Tessier originally told police that he and Wallen were kidnapped by several African-American men in Olney at Ms. Wallens home and were forced to drive to the field in Damascus in the defendants vehicle, where the men proceeded to shoot Ms. Wallen. Tessier later recanted and told police he got into a fight with Wallen at his temporary residence. He said Wallen tried to attack him with a pair of scissors. Tessier darted away from Wallen and she ran into a wooden post on the porch and collapsed. Instead of calling the police, Tessier said he believe Wallen died from striking her head on the porch post and decided to bury her in the field. When he grew concerned perhaps she was not deceased and that he had buried her alive, he stated he shot her once in the back of the head, to ensure she wasnt suffering, prosecutors said. A week after Wallens disappearance, her parents joined Tessier at a press conference coordinated by the Montgomery County Police Department to help find her. Her family offered a reward for information. Police later said the decision to include Tessier in the press conference, while he was considered a person of interest, was strategic and done in concert with the family, to see what Tessier would say. For the week that Wallen was missing, police said Tessier paid several visits to a Damascus property in the 12400 block of Prices Distillery Road where a farm was surrounded by acres of woods and open fields. See Related: When police searched the area, tire tracks led them to nearby location where they found the body on Sept. 13, 2017. Authorities said Wallen had been shot in the back of the head, and they charged Tessier with first-degree murder. Because the unborn child was not viable outside of the womb, Montgomery County States Attorney John McCarthy told media that Tessier was indicted on one murder count rather than two in Wallens death. Now, Wallens parents are advocating for a change in Maryland law that would protect all unborn children if the mother is murdered, regardless of how far along she is in the pregnancy. A monster with one bullet killed two generations of our family, her father, Mark Wallen, said at a press conference at the end of January in Annapolis. A new bill, which is called Laura and Reids Law to recognize the teacher and the name she had selected for her unborn child, would amend the definition of homicide when it comes to killing a fetus so that it includes a fetus at any stage of development that is carried in the womb. Homicide is the leading cause of death among pregnant women, according to a study from the Maryland Department of Health, which found it usually occurs in the first three months of pregnancy, with firearms the most common method. Tessiers 10-day trial will begin on Sept. 4. He faces life in prison without parole. Photos of Tyler Tessier and Laura Wallen courtesy of the Montgomery County Police Department.",0

1288,"A native of China and former student of the University of Iowa who was facing first-degree kidnapping charges pleaded guilty today to lesser charges. According to the Daily Iowan, Peng Tang, 22, entered a guilty plea today to several charges: Peng Tang, 22, plead guilty Monday to sexual abuse in the third degree, extortion, and a separate charge of soliciting to tamper with a witness. With his plea deal he faces up to 17 years total in prison. He may face up to 10 years for the sexual abuse charge, five years for extortion, and two years for the solicitation. His guilty plea to sexual abuse in the third degree was an Alford plea — a plea given to a defendant when he believes he could be convicted however is not admitting to committing a crime. Peng Tangs attorney told the Iowa City Press-Citizen that he almost certainly be deported back to China following his sentence: Clemens Erdahl, Peng Tangs attorney, said there was a 100 percent likelihood (Tang) will be deported. But first, Tang, 22, will serve up to 17 years in prison after reaching a plea agreement with the county attorneys office. Tang had been facing a life sentence and was scheduled to go to trial next week for kidnapping and tampering with a witness. In late March of 2011, Tang was arrested and accused of sexually assaulting a woman who was showing him her apartment for rent last week found her through a website that caters to Chinese nationals, according to a search warrant filed as part of court documents at the Johnson County Courthouse. According to the search warrant, the woman who reported to police that she had been sexually assaulted had placed her ad on zhan.renren.comwith the intent of subletting her apartment. The warrant stated that the ad was directed at Chinese nationals and was written in Chinese. The woman received a response to her ad last Thursday (March 29) and agreed to meet him that night at 8 p.m., according to the warrant. The man was identified as Peng Tang, 21, of Iowa City. As the woman was showing the man the bedroom, he grabbed the victim by the hands and attempted to tie her up, according to the documents. Telling her he had a knife, he then forced her to perform sex acts and took photos, according to the warrant. You have better follow my requirements because I have a knife, the man told the woman, according to Iowa City police criminal complaint. Near the end of the assault, the woman told the man she had friends waiting for her at the University of Iowa Main Library, so he walked her there afterward, later warning her by text message that if she went to the police he would post the photos of the sex acts online, according to the search warrant. Later charges filed against Tang included burglarizing his old residence before the alleged assault -- stealing a laptop and womens underwear -- and after he was in jail attempting to convince the female victim in the case to change her story. The case was also muddied after Tang claimed to not understand the concept of Miranda Rights, due to there being no Chinese equivalent, and a witness tampering case against his parents being dropped by the Johnson County Attorney due to cultural differences. Hayley Bruce of the Gazette reports that so there would be no further confusion, Mondays proceedings took place almost entirely in Chinese: The entire hearing Monday afternoon took place in Tangs native language, with the assistance of an interpreter. During the hearing, Sixth District Judge Ian Thornhill reviewed the possible sentences for each charge, the rights Tang would give up during his plea, and asked a series of questions to determine whether Tang was voluntarily and intelligently entering guilty pleas for each charge.",1

1291,"One of the three men originally from the Peninsula who kidnapped a busload of Chowchilla schoolchildren in 1976 and buried them in a quarry in Livermore for ransom was paroled from the California Mens Colony in San Luis Obispo at 5:15 a.m. Thursday, state prison officials said. The parole for 63-year-old James Schoenfeld, who had been behind bars for 29 years, was expected because last week Gov. Jerry Brown decided to let stand a parole boards ruling on April 1 to grant him parole. Brown had 120 days to approve the panels decision or ask for all 12 members of the panel to review it but that period expired at midnight on July 30 without Brown taking any action. Brown didnt have the authority to reverse the panels decision because he only has that authority in murder cases. The state Board of Parole Hearings legal staff reviewed the panels ruling and concluded that it was consistent with the evidence that was presented at Schoenfelds parole hearing, his attorney, Scott Handelman, said. Schoenfeld, his brother Richard Schoenfeld, 60, and Frederick Woods were in their early to mid 20s when they ambushed a busload of schoolchildren from Dairyland Union School in Chowchilla, a small farm community about 35 miles northwest of Fresno in Madera County, on July 15, 1976, according to prosecutors. The men left the bus camouflaged in a creek bed and drove the children and bus driver Ed Ray about 100 miles to the California Rock and Gravel Quarry in Livermore in Alameda County. They sealed their victims in a large van that had been buried in a cave at the quarry and fitted to keep the children and driver hostage, prosecutors said. The kidnappers, all from wealthy families in the Peninsula communities of Atherton and Portola Valley, then demanded a $5 million ransom for the schoolchildren and Ray. Previous: Chowchilla Kidnapper From Peninsula Who Buried Busload of Children in Quarry in 1976 Granted Parole The hostages escaped from the buried van a little more than a day after they were first kidnapped when Ray and the two oldest children piled mattresses to the top of the van and forced their way out. The Schoenfeld brothers and Woods received life sentences after pleading guilty in Alameda County Superior Court in 1977 to 27 counts of kidnapping for ransom. But an appellate court ruled in 1980 that they were eligible for parole, finding that the victims didnt suffer any bodily harm. The Alameda County District Attorneys has opposed parole for the three defendants and until recently the Board of Parole Hearings had denied their parole requests multiple times over the years. The panel recommended parole for Richard Schoenfeld in 2011 and he was released from prison in June 2012. He was discharged from parole in June. Woods is still in prison but will have another parole hearing on Nov. 19. By Bay City News",1

Marian Petro, 46, of Fort Lee, N.J. was found Tuesday in a hotel in Willow Grove, Pa., where she was staying with extended family, said Charles Webster, spokesman for the Monmouth County Prosecutors Office. The incident began with a 911 call received by Monroe Township, N.J., police about 6:35 a.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 19, Webster said. In the call, the woman -- now identified as Petro -- said she was pulled over in a vehicle and forced into the back seat of another car at gunpoint near the intersection of Route 33 and Sweetmans Lane in Manalapan, N.J., Webster said. Manalapan police officers responded but were unable to find the woman, the car or any witnesses to the incident, he said. The investigation led to a possible location in the area of Hulses Corner Road and Fort Plains Road in Howell, Webster said, where police from several towns, as well as county, state and federal law enforcement agencies responded in an effort to find the victim. That investigation did not yield the reported victim, vehicle or any additional evidence of an abduction, Webster said. After the area was cleared, the efforts to locate the caller and substantiate the report intensified, Webster said. On Tuesday, she was found, unharmed, at a hotel in Willow, Grove, Pa., where she was staying with her extended family. Further investigation revealed she had purposely made several false statements in her 911 call when she claimed she was held at gunpoint and put into the backseat of a black Mercedes Benz by a black male with dreadlocks, Webster said. Petro is charged with third-degree creating a false public alarm. She is being held in the Montgomery Township Correctional Facility, Lower Providence, Pa., pending extradition to New Jersey, he said. If convicted of creating a false public alarm, Petro faces a sentence of three to five years in prison. The case is assigned to Monmouth County Assistant Prosecutor Christopher Decker, director of the Offices Major Crimes Bureau, Webster said. The joint investigation was conducted with the partnership of the Manalapan Township Police Department, Howell Township Police Department, Howell Township Office of Emergency Management, Fort Lee Police Department, Carteret Police Department, Upper Moreland Township, Pa., Police Department, Hatboro, Pa., Police Department, New York City Police Department, Monmouth County Prosecutors Office, Monmouth County Sheriffs Office, Monmouth County Office of Emergency Management, Monmouth County Emergency Response Team, New Jersey State Police, United State Marshals Service, and Federal Bureau of Investigation.",0

1299,"A man was convicted Tuesday of the kidnap-murder of a Riverside County resident who was slain at a Coachella Valley drug den, then left bound inside his burning SUV. Andrew John Muir, 29, faces life in prison without the possibility of parole for the killing of 38-year-old Jason Cupit of Palm Desert. Prosecutors said the victim was stabbed in the back at an Indio home frequented by Muir prior to being left — handcuffed — inside his own vehicle, which was found ablaze off Vista Del Norte in Coachella on Aug. 14, 2015. Jurors deliberated for about one day before returning their verdict on murder, kidnapping and arson counts, and also found true a special circumstance allegation of committing the murder in the commission of a felony. A sentencing date was not immediately set. Deputy District Attorney Anthony Orlando told the jury that Muir brought Cupit to the Indio home, where they bought drugs, and then a day after Cupits death, offered to buy gas and food for several people with the victims credit card, which was used at two area gas stations and at a Jack in the Box restaurant. Orlando said the evidence against Muir was circumstantial, but pointed to him as Cupits killer. Muirs body was found handcuffed inside his burning Toyota Rav4 just before 4 a.m. An autopsy showed he was burned over more than 75 percent of his body, but died of a stab wound to the back and also suffered blunt force trauma before the fire. Defense attorney John Dolan said Muir took part only in burning the victims car. He alleged that Cupit was killed by the men who lived at the home, including a now-deceased drug dealer and other addicts. Dolan said the only evidence linking his client to Cupits death was the word of unreliable witnesses, one of whom told investigators that Muir said Cupit was acting sheisty and that he killed that guy. The witness also told investigators that he saw Muir speeding off from the home in Cupits SUV, while a person in the cargo area was seen popping up once or twice as the vehicle was departing. Dolan said that no one else could corroborate the claims of the witness, who he suggested may have been involved in Cupits death. He made up a story, Dolan alleged, because he knew when the cops came, the jig was up. He was in trouble. He needed to deflect away from himself so hes going to deflect to Mr. Muir. Muir, who was arrested on Sept. 8 at the Arabia Mobile Home Park in Indio, told investigators that he found Cupit lying on the floor of the Indio home. He admitted dragging Cupit into the victims Rav4, which he wiped down at another location, and also told investigators that he stole a can of gasoline, parked the SUV and left the gas can inside before walking away, according to the prosecution. At the Indio home, investigators found Cupits blood on the floor and ceiling of the living room and in two bedrooms. An aluminum baseball bat used to beat Cupit was also found, along with a crowbar that Dolan said was likely used to strike the victim. A forensic pathologist testified that Cupits wound was caused by a knife, but Dolan said no knife was located or could be linked to Muir. He also argued that no fingerprints or DNA from his client were found inside the home or on the bat or crowbar. — By City News Service / Image via Shutterstock",1

1302,"St. Petersburg, FlOpinion by: E. Eugene Webb PhDAuthor: In Search of Robin, So You Want to Blog. First, there was the shooting at Marjory Douglas High School, then the call to action by the Douglas High victims and students, then the Legislature passed a school Safety Bill; the governor signed it. Now all we hear is carping and complaining from sheriffs, police chiefs and mostly from school district superintendents about money and how they will pay for all of this. The legislature provided some money, but that was redirected from school funding all the more to the ire of local school boards, superintendents and educational leaders. Let me tell you what I havent heard. I have not heard of any plan from school systems to lower costs, to reduce administrative staff or overhead. No attempts to push school planners for more efficient schedules for everything from transportation and maintenance to classes. No plans to reduce expenses for sports, arts and other niche educational programs that serve a few provided by the school systems. No, the school boards want to keep doing the same inefficient job and pad their funding by holding your kids safety hostage. It seems they have all seized on this safety issue as an opportunity to go fishing for more funding. If law enforcement from Sheriff to police departments needs to staff up to provide school security, funding should be forth coming immediately from the State, and there should be no reduction in overall policing to accomplish the school security task. All of this will take time to hire, train and equip deputies and police officers for the task. The real question here is: are the law enforcement agencies going to provide school security as a public service or are the school systems going to buy this service from law enforcement? From a dollars and sense perspective, it really does not matter since the money all comes from the same place, your taxes, regardless of who handles it. I for one, would much rather the State fund law enforcement directly to provide the service to the schools and keep school boards and their administrators fingers out of the money flow. School Boards are notoriously poor in administering these types of agreements, and they will add several layers of bureaucracy, all at our expense, to oversee, manage and complicate the issue. These school systems would like nothing better than a new large stream of cash flow that they can manage, massage, manipulate and hold back to keep law enforcement in line. The Legislature should step up and establish a per school resource officer level of funding for each county in the state and supply the funds to the local sheriff who sets the staffing levels and who can provide the service or contract with local police agencies. Now its all law enforcement all the time with no complications. E-mail Doc at mail to: dr.gwebb@yahoo.com or send me a Facebook (E. Eugene Webb) Friend request.

1303,"Authorities are looking for a man who left a woman hospitalized after assaulting her Sunday in the 2900 block of Wetherburn Court, according to Prince William County Police. He already had been wanted for assaulting the same woman last summer at the same address. Marcus Allen Mays, 32, of no fixed address, is wanted for malicious wounding in the latest incident and abduction, assault and battery and destruction of property in the first incident. Hes described as black, 5-9, 210 pounds with brown eyes and black hair.

Both of them fled upon seeing police but the woman eventually was found with injuries to her upper body. She said she and Mays had been involved in an argument that escalated, during which he assaulted her. Further investigation found that Mays was the same man who was wanted for assaulting the woman early on July 17.

1307,"- A state appellate court panel Tuesday upheld a mans conviction for kidnapping a 10-year-old girl from her bed in Northridge and sexually assaulting her at various locations. The three-justice panel from Californias 2nd District Court of Appeal cited overwhelming evidence in the case against Tobias Dustin Summers, who is serving a life prison sentence without the possibility of parole. The justices rejected the defenses contention that Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen violated Summers right to present a defense and to confront witnesses by limiting the defenses questioning of some DNA experts. While DNA can often be powerful evidence against a criminal defendant, the DNA evidence in this case was not critical to the prosecution, the appellate court justices wrote in their 20-page ruling. Even excluding all forms of DNA analysis, defendants guilt was overwhelmingly demonstrated by victim identification testimony, circumstantial evidence, (the victims) toxicology reports, corroborating witnesses, and defendants own testimony and statements. The girl testified during the trial, telling jurors that she was led from her home in the dark in the early morning hours of March 27, 2013, and told to get into a car driven by another man, who got out of the vehicle after her assailant said he was going to drop her off at a fire station. Were you scared? the prosecutor asked. Yes, the girl responded. She said she wanted to go home. The girls mother testified that she woke up, heard noises in her daughters room and saw the familys dog trying to get at the girls pet hamster, then realized that her daughter was not in bed. She started screaming her daughters name and called 911 after not being able to find the girl. Jurors heard a recording of the womans emotional 911 call reporting her daughters disappearance. Summers was arrested almost a month later at a drug and rehabilitation center south of Tijuana, Mexico. He told jurors that the girl looked like a little version of my mom. His trial attorney, Jeff Yanuck, suggested that someone else assaulted the girl and that his client had saved her. There was no sperm, no saliva or any blood of Mr. Summers anywhere, the defense lawyer told jurors. He chose to tell you what happened. Mr. Summers told you that he did not have any inappropriate touching of (the girl) and the DNA evidence supports that. Deputy District Attorney Laura Knight contended that Summers washed DNA evidence off the girl at a vacant house -- one of the locations the girl was taken. A small amount of DNA on the girls face was tested and found to be male. Summers could not be excluded as a contributor, while DNA on the girls shorts was found consistent with the defendant, the prosecutor said. He kidnapped, he raped her, he sexually assaulted her ... He would have you believe that, somehow, he saved her life, Knight told the jury that convicted Summers in September 2015 of more than 30 counts, including aggravated sexual assault of a child. Jurors also found true allegations that he had used a knife and belt and that she had been bound or tied during some of the crimes. At Summers sentencing in October 2015, the judge called him a predator in every sense of the word. He ordered the defendant to serve life in prison without the possibility of parole plus 14 potential life prison terms. The girls father said his daughter is a survivor who insisted on testifying against Summers to ensure that he did not get out from behind bars. He is a monster, the father said. He is a danger to everybody. If he ever gets out, he will do it again. Fidgeting before she spoke, the girl said, It was not right. No one should ever have to go through that, ever. I hope he goes away forever ... Daniel Martinez, who was charged along with Summers, was convicted separately of burglary but acquitted of the girls kidnapping. He was sentenced to six years behind bars, and his appeals have been denied. City News Service",1
1308,"- A leader of the Bloods street gang ordered the hit that killed a 9-month-old boy from behind the walls of a Georgia prison, prosecutors say. Kenneth Eric Jackson -- known as KG the God -- was indicted on murder and gang-related charges Tuesday for his role in the May 2014 shooting death of KenDarious Edwards, Jr. This was a ruthless act ordered by a gang leader looking to spread fear and intimidation, DeKalb County District Attorney Robert James said in a news release. We are in a war with gangs in DeKalb County, and too many innocent people are being hurt. This is not your county. Get out or face the consequences. Prosecutors say Jackson is Georgias highest-ranking member of the Sex Money Murder Bloods, a set within the nationwide Bloods gang. They say he was incarcerated at Autry State Prison when he used a contraband mobile phone to order an assassination attempt. It was on Jacksons orders, prosecutors say, when on the night of May 10, 2014, Devin Thomas, Marco Watson and Christopher Florence forced their way into the home on Lani Farm Road, in southeast DeKalb County, where KenDarious was staying with his mother, grandmother and a family friend. The three women hid in a bathroom with KenDarious, but their attackers cornered them and opened fire, shooting everyone in the room and killing the infant, authorities say. Jackson, Florence and Watson are charged with malice murder, felony murder, multiple counts of aggravated assault and violation of Georgias Street Gang and Terrorism Act. Florence and Watson also were charged with possession of a gun by a felon. Watson, who participated as a part of initiation into Sex Money Murder, and Eunice English, described by prosecutors as a non-gang member, also were charged with one count each of kidnapping and aggravated assault for intimidating a witness cooperating with police on May 28, 2014. Thomas, who prosecutors say was a mid-level member of Sex Money Murder, has pleaded guilty to murder and is serving life plus 20 years in prison.

1309,"After a foot pursuit after a wanted man last year, two local officers were recently recognized. Morris Twp. Officer Clay Boeninghaus and Hanover Twp. Officer Paul Gundersdorf received the Distinguished Service Award from ASIS International on Tuesday. On July 14 last year, Hanover Township Police responded to a home invasion.  The intruder—later indentified as Nisees Ingram, 26 of Irvington—got into the home by using the garage remote from the victims car parked in her driveway. When Ingram got inside, he told the homeowner that he didnt want to hurt her and only wanted her car. He told her to go with him through her garage and into the car in the driveway. However, when the homeowner got into her car, she was able to lock the car doors before Ingram got in. She repeatedly honked the horn, which made him run away. Gundersdorf responded and secured the neighborhood of Academy Drive East. Gundersdorf helped the Morris County Sheriffs K-9 officer as they searched the wooded area behind the homes. A passing motorist reported seeing Ingram running into the backyard of a home on Cedar Knolls Road. Gundersdorf went to the new location and was joined by Boeninghaus. They saw Ingram behind the property and started chasing him asking him to stop, but he continued running into the wooded yards of the homes in the area. Ingram finally ran into an area of heavy brush, where he was handcuffed and searched. Following the arrest, the officers searched the area and found stolen property from the home invasion. Later it was discovered that Ingram was a wanted person by the NJ State Parole Board and had a criminal history of numerous arrests including 13 felony convictions. He was charged with burglary to a motor vehicle, possession of burglary tools, kidnapping, theft of moveable property, hindering apprehension, and possession of a controlled dangerous substance, heroin.",0

1314,"Erick Howard was caught on tape at Wal-Mart buying supplies to use in , Stark County Assistant Prosecutor Chryssa Hartnett said. There are incriminating phone records and firsthand accounts from . And as the person who tied her up, robbed her and raped her in her bedroom, Hartnett said today during her closing arguments in Howards trial. To believe it was someone other than Erick Howard in that room, you would have to believe the mother of all coincidences has occurred and the stars have aligned to make all these other things coincidental. Hartnett presented her closing arguments about 12:45 p.m. today along with Rufus Sims, whos representing Howard. Jury began deliberating about 2:30 p.m. Howard, a  grad and two-time Mr. Football recipient, is accused of breaking into the home of a young North Canton couple in 1100 block of Sunford Avenue, duct-taping their wrists and ankles and robbing them at gunpoint. Hes charged with aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, rape and kidnapping, all carrying a firearm specification. Hes on trial for those charges this week in Stark County Common Pleas Court. Hartnett refuted Sims argument that Howard is too large to fit through the basement window, which is how accomplice Seth R. Obermiller got into the couples townhouse. Obermiller testified this week that, like him, Howard had no difficulty getting into the home. Sims asked several witnesses throughout the week how much they thought Howard weighed and whether a man of his size could fit through the window in question. According to testimony, the men had duct-taped over the window and knocked out the glass on half of it. The tape helped make a clean break and keep the glass together. Look at this, Sims said, holding up a photo of the window to show the jurors. Are you serious? Hows the torso get through? Hows his shoulders get through? We submit to you folks it cant happen and it didnt happen. Hartnett argued that although Howard is somewhat broad, he still is a limber athlete capable of maneuvering his body through a tight space — thats what he had to do as a football player. She called Sims window argument a distraction. Dont be distracted — because this game is over for him, she said. Jurors heard testimony from the male and female victims this week. Both said they believed it was two black men who broke into their apartment (Obermiller, whos been convicted and sentenced for robbing them, is actually white). The female victim said she thought the smaller of the two men (Obermiller) was black because his skin showing through the ski mask looked like that of a lighter-skinned black man. The male victim said he thought the two were both black because of the dialect they used when talking to each other. Sims brought this discrepancy up during his closing argument. He added that the female victim already was convinced it was Howard who robbed and raped her, even before she talked to a detective, because a friend told her he suspected Howard. That friend, Sims said, was holding a grudge against Howard because the two had gotten into a fight in high school. The female victim later and play for her over the phone a Canton Repository YouTube video in which Howard was featured as player of the game. After only hearing the audio, she said thats how she knew for sure that Howard was responsible. Even prior to hearing the evidence, folks, (the victim) was aware of rumors being circulated, Sims said. Howard had met the male victim for the first time a couple weeks before the incident, according to testimony. The three men plotted to rob the couple because knew the male victim, had bought marijuana off of him and knew where he lived, Taylor testified this week. Sims said the Wal-Mart video, which Hartnett said clearly shows Howard buying gloves and walking out of the store, is actually not a clear representation of Howard. Hes also wearing shorts and short-sleeves, while the victims described both men as wearing pants and long-sleeve shirts. And the testimony from co-defendants Obermiller and Michael A. Taylor, who served as the lookout that night? Not credible, Sims said. The two were only looking out for themselves when they struck a plea agreement with prosecutors. Obermiller pleaded guilty to kidnapping, aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery, with all charges accompanied by gun specifications, and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Taylor, who said he originally planned to rob the couple that night but stayed outside the apartment instead, pleaded guilty to attempt to commit burglary. Hell spend three years on probation. All they had to do to seal the deal was deliver this guy, Sims said, pointing at Howard. They got a deal in exchange for coming in here and testifying. You put a value of whatever you want on that. Jury is out on deliberation now. Check back with North Canton Patch for more trial coverage this week. NORTH CANTON PATCH TRIAL COVERAGE    Rape Victim Testifies in Erick Howard Trial",0

1319,"Governor Tom Corbett signed his 21st execution warrant today for Mark Newton Spotz, convicted of kidnapping, robbing and brutally murdering a York County woman during a four-county homicide spree in 1995.. Spotz murdered of Penny Gunnet, 41, who was the third of Spotzs four murder victims during a homicidal rampage between late January and early February 1995. The execution is been scheduled for Jan. 8, 2013. Executions in Pennsylvania are carried out by lethal injection. For more information, visit the Department of Corrections online at www.cor.state.pa.us and select Death Penalty from the left-side navigation bar. The following account was released from the governors office: Gunnet was carjacked on her way to work around 6 a.m. on the morning of Feb. 2, 1995. Spotz forced his way into her car at gunpoint, stealing her cash, credit cards, wedding rings and other jewelry. Gunnets body was found beneath her abandoned car several hours later. During the carjacking, she had been shot and run over, a pathologist said. Spotz was arrested, tried separately and convicted in four different Pennsylvania counties for killing his brother and three women. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death for each woman he killed. For his brothers death, Spotz, who is now 41, was sentenced to 17 ½ to 35 years in prison. The killing spree began Jan. 31, 1995, in Clearfield County when Spotz shot his brother, Dustin, after a fight. He fled the area, stopping in Schuylkill County on Feb. 1, 1995. There, around 5:30 a.m., Spotz encountered June Ohlinger who had just arrived at the convenience store where she worked. Spotz forced her at gunpoint back into her car, stealing her money and jewelry, including her wedding ring. Spotz then ordered Ohlinger out of the car, walked her to the center of the bridge and forced her to stand on a bridge railing. He then shot her in the back of her head and kicked her body into the creek below. Spotz drove off with her car. The following day, concerned that he had been driving Ohlingers car for 24 hours and that the police might be tracking him, Spotz told his girlfriend he was going to get the next woman. The next woman was Gunnet, who like Ohlinger was on her way to work when she stopped her car at an intersection in York. A gun-wielding Spotz forced his way into her car, drove around for awhile, shot her twice at close range and then abandoned her car and dead body. About an hour later, a police officer was called to investigate an abandoned car. Gunnets dead body lay twisted underneath the car with dried blood on her face and clothes. Later that day, Spotz traveled to Harrisburg and abducted 71-year-old Betty Amstutz near her home in Dauphin County. He drove with Amstutz to two banks, cashing checks worth a total of $1,600, and then used her credit card to make purchases at a sporting goods store and to rent a room at a Carlisle motel. Hours later, Spotz then drove Amstutz to a rural road outside of Carlisle, shot her numerous times and left her bullet-riddled body in a roadside ditch. Spotz then drove back to town, picked up friends, bought drugs and returned to the motel, bragging how he had shot and killed his brother and these other women. Shortly before 9 a.m. the next morning, Feb. 3, 1995, police located Spotz and surrounded the motel. Spotz saw the police, tossed his gun outside and turned himself in to authorities.",1
1320,"This is a living hell. That is what I have been telling people. You see this on TV. You dont think this is going to happen to you and it is here. Thats how Shannon Toth of Macungie describes what lifes been like since her mother disappeared Aug. 16. No foul play is involved. There hasnt been an abduction. Toths mother, Denise Kuhns, just walked out the door last Friday morning and she hasnt been seen since. The 55-year-old Macungie woman does suffer from depression, Toth explains, but she is not medicated for the condition. She doesnt drive. She left for work at 6:30 a.m. Friday and hasnt been seen since. Nobody knows what Kuhns was wearing when she disappeared. But she is described as 5-feet-6, 130 pounds, with short blond hair and hazel eyes. She does not have any tattoos or other distinguishing marks, according to her daughter. She is gone and nobody knows anything, Toth says. Kuhns lives with Toths father and he was the last person to see her when she left their home to go to work. He came home from work that day and his wife didnt. Apparently she never even got to work. Toths father eventually found what Toth describes as a  bizarre note from his wife saying that she might not be back. It came totally out of the blue, Toth says. A total bomb dropped on our family. She obviously had a mental breakdown that is clearly obvious. I am assuming people like that need to be hospitalized. Toth says that her family did talk to Macungie Police, but the police cannot classify her mother as a missing person because that means there has been an abduction or some sort of foul play. The police did put out what is called an attempt to locate but that didnt bring any clues. To me and our family she is missing, she is gone, says Toth, who has two sisters and a brother who also live in the Macungie area. We have literally exhausted everything, she says. The police did talk to people. We went to my moms work. We talked to all of her friends. We did everything. All we can say is she has been gone since Friday and we have no idea where she is. Anyone with any information on where Denise Kuhns is can call her daughter, Shannon Toth, at 610-573-3602. Or they can contact the Macungie Police at 610-966-2222. We just want to know where she is and that she is all right, Toth says. If anyone knows anything, whether or not she wants to be found, we need answers.",0
1321,"A Burlington County man has been sentenced to five years in state prison, including more than four years of parole ineligibility, after he admitted to coercing a 13-year-old girl he met online into sending him sexually explicit photos of herself, Attorney General Christopher S. Porrino said on Friday. Craig L. Wyatt, 25, of Willingboro, previously pleaded guilty to charges of first-degree manufacturing child pornography and third-degree possession of child pornography. He will be required to register as a sex offender under Megans Law and will be subject to parole supervision for life. The state recommended Wyatt serve eight years in prison, including nearly seven years of parole ineligibility, but Superior Court Judge Terrence R. Cook instead imposed the five-year sentence on Friday. No reason was given as to why the judge handed down the reduced sentence. An investigation by the New Jersey State Police Digital Technology Investigations Unit revealed that Wyatt threatened to take the girl away from her home against her will if she did not send him sexually explicit photos of herself, according to authorities. His trial in August ended with a hung jury. He was previously convicted of five counts of terroristic threats in Burlington and Atlantic counties for stalking other girls on Facebook and sending them threatening messages.He served over a year in jail and was on probation at the time of the crime to which he ultimately pleaded guilty on June 2. Wyatt was indicted on Nov. 17, 2015, on charges related to the 13-year-old girl, whom he met on Facebook in May of 2014. The girl told him she was 15. Initially, he befriended her by flattering her and sending her affectionate texts. However, after he obtained one or more nude photos of her, he became increasingly threatening, according to authorities. In May and June of 2014, he threatened her 10 times in order to get more photos of her that were more sexually explicit, authorities said. Wyatt repeatedly threatened to abduct her in a series of text messages and on Facebook. He repeatedly threatened to kidnap her and/or post the photos of her he already possessed on the Internet if she did not give him more pictures. He said others would help him take her away, and that he would get her pregnant, according to authorities.After a concerned relative of the victim learned of the threats, they contacted the State Police Digital Technology Investigations Unit, which investigated and arrested Wyatt on Oct. 31, 2014. Detectives said they found 36 sexually explicit images of the victim, including 34 saved in his cell phone that they seized. There were two more saved in his Facebook account. Anyone who suspects improper contact by persons communicating with children on the Internet or possible exploitation or sexual abuse of children is urged to contact the New Jersey Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Tipline at 888-648-6007.

1325,"A man allegedly linked through DNA evidence to the 2001 kidnapping and sexually assault of a 14-year-old boy in the San Fernando Valley pleaded not guilty Thursday to felony charges and was ordered held on $1 million bail. Mirek Voyt, 55, of Hollywood was arrested at his home on Tuesday, according to Los Angeles Police Department Capt. William Hayes, who announced the arrest at a news conference at downtown police headquarters. Voyt was arraigned on one count each of kidnapping to commit oral copulation by force or fear and forcible oral copulation, with an allegation that he used a handgun during the commission of the crimes, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office. Although DNA evidence was obtained at the time of the crime, a match was not made until Voyt was arrested on suspicion of grand theft late last year and his DNA was obtained and run through a state database, according to Hayes, commanding officer of the LAPDs Robbery-Homicide Division. The victim was walking to school with another boy about 9:45 a.m. on June 22, 2001, near the intersection of Chase Street and Vanalden Avenue in Northridge when a man armed with a handgun confronted them, according to Hayes. One of the boys managed to flee but the other was kidnapped, taken to an unknown location and sexually assaulted before he was released, the captain said. Voyt lived within a short distance of the intersection where the abduction occurred, and investigators allege he took the boy to his home after abducting him and blindfolding him. At the time of his arrest, Voyt was working in a management position for a grocery store chain, and since 2001 has lived in various locations in the Los Angeles area, the captain said. Hayes said investigators fear Voyt may have victimized others. Sexual assault crimes involving males often go unreported, and we want them to know we are willing to work with them and help them in any way ...., he said. He displayed photos of the suspect from 1997, 2012 and 2017, and said all investigations would be handled confidentially. When you look at a predator of this nature and the violence that occurred in 2001, although hes remained off the radar in terms of other criminal acts, one would find it hard to believe that that was the only time, Hayes said. So thats why we are trying to be cautious and go out there. Anyone with information about the suspect was urged to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS. Tips can be made anonymously.

1327,"LITTLE ROCK, AR— Arkansas Prosecutor Kyle Hunter has charged inmates Alfred Maxey, Robert Rhodes, Kirk Traylor, Jeremy Williams and Gary Gould in two unrelated attacks that occurred on the same afternoon. Three guards were injured and subsequently hospitalized in the attacks. Gould committed battery, Hunter said, when he attacked a prison guard in the afternoon on Sept. 28 at the Maximum Security Unit in Tucker. The other four were charged with battery for an attack on two guards at the states Varner Unit on on the same day. Traylor and Williams were also each charged with one count of possession or use of a weapon by an incarcerated person. The incidents number among a string of violent disturbances in the states correctional facilities this year. A State Police investigator said in an affidavit filed in state court that the Varner attack began when Traylor confronted Correction Officer Corey Lowery about a homemade hoodie the guard had confiscated from the inmate earlier that day. A Department of Correction spokesman said the hoodie would be considered contraband material. Traylor attacked Lowery, cutting and stabbing him several times with a homemade weapon, according to the affidavit. The affidavit accuses the other three inmates of joining in on the attack. It says Williams also used a homemade weapon to cut and stab the guard. Another officer, Herbert Straughn, received cut and stab wounds to the back of his head and neck when he responded to assist Lowery. The department in September said it used nonlethal force on several inmates who barricaded themselves in a barracks after the assault. The Varner attack occurred less than three hours after the attack at the Maximum Security Unit, also known as Tucker Max. According to another affidavit filed by State Police, security footage showed Gould striking Correction Officer James Duke with his fist as the guard was writing a disciplinary form about the inmate. The footage showed Gould jumping on Duke and hitting the guard repeatedly after he fell to the floor, according to the affidavit. All three guards were hospitalized and later released. The Varner guards have since returned to work, but the guard injured in the Tucker Max attack has not, Correction Department Spokesman Solomon Graves said. The string of violence at Arkansas prisons has included inmates taking guards hostage on two separate occasions at the Tucker Max facility, and in one of those incidents inmates snatched keys and a Taser from the guards. State prison officials earlier this year announced several security upgrades in response to the incidents and have said theyre struggling with a high number of vacancies. Achieving successful prosecutions is an essential tool in combating incidents of violence within our facilities, State Department of Correction Director Wendy Kelley said in a statement Thursday. We will continue to support and cooperate with the prosecution of these cases as they proceed through the trial phase. Photo by Ian Waldie/Getty Images By ANDREW DeMILLO, Associated Press",0

1329,"A homeless man is facing a murder charge after police said he ran down a Marriott shuttle bus driver over the weekend who allegedly tried to stop him from stealing the vehicle with three passengers aboard. The driver died from his injuries. Edward Reid then allegedly took off on a wild chase through nearby streets, striking two vehicles along the way, according to Miami-Dade police. Detective Lee Cowart of the Miami-Dade Police Department told Patch that Reid let his three passengers off the hotel shuttle at some point. Cowart identified the slain Marriott driver as 62-year-old Eladio Rodriguez Cristobal, who had gone inside the hotel for a moment when Reid allegedly boarded the shuttle and attempted to drive away from the Courtyard By Marriott Miami Coral Gables. The hotel is located at 2051 S Le Jeune Road not far from Miami International Airport. Our victim loaded the bus. There were three customers on board at the time. He was loading their luggage, Cowart told Patch. He goes back in the lobby, probably to make an announcement that they are heading over to the airport. The 40-year-old Reid was riding a bicycle through the hotel parking lot when he apparently spotted the shuttle as it was getting ready to leave. He dumps the bicycle, jumps on the truck, throws the truck into drive and tries to flee the Courtyard By Marriott, Cowart said. In the process of fleeing, our victim runs out and somehow positions himself in order to stop the carjacking, and our subject strikes him with the shuttle bus. Cowart said that the passengers were still on the shuttle bus at the time. Then the shuttle bus attempts to leave the premises and the three people in some fashion convince our subject to release them and let them go, which he did, Cowart explained. Reid allegedly struck two more vehicles before being chased down by a driver of one of the vehicles somewhere across the Miami border, Cowart added. Miami police finally caught up with the shuttle bus and took Reid into custody. In addition to murder, Reid is charged with three counts of kidnapping, carjacking and leaving the scene of an accident, Cowart said.

1332,"CROWN HEIGHTS, BROOKLYN — More than 10 years after her unsolved murder in Crown Heights, the family of Bed-Stuy teenager Chanel Petro-Nixon is again calling for any information that could lead to the capture of her killer. Meanwhile, a man reported as a person of interest in the case has been charged with murder on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent, according to Pix11. Petro-Nixon was 16 when she disappeared on June 18, 2006. Before leaving her Bed-Stuy home, Petro-Nixon told her parents that she was going to apply for a job at a neighborhood Applebees, the New York Daily News reported. In a tragic end to her familys search, Petro-Nixon was found dead four days later in a garbage bag outside 212 Kingston Ave. in Crown Heights. A June 18 rally is planned for the site where her body was found. The event will begin at 11 a.m. Its being organized by the Brooklyn Anti-Violence Coalition, a community group led by Rev. W. Taharka Robinson that focuses on preventing violent crime in the borough. Robinson said the gathering will celebrate Petro-Nixons life, and will call for individuals in the community to come forth with information [on the murder] if they have information. The rally is being planned just as a potentially major development in the case unfolds abroad. As reported by Pix11, a man identified by the station as a person of interest in connection to Petro-Nixons murder, 29-year-old Veron Primus, was recently arrested and charged with murder on the island of St. Vincent. According to the news station, Primus — who went to middle school with Petro-Nixon and planned to meet her at Applebees on the day she disappeared — is now accused of fatally stabbing St. Vincent realtor Sharleen Graves, a murder with eerie similarities to Petro-Nixons. Primus is also under investigation for the three-month abduction of another St. Vincent woman, 24-year-old Mewanah Hadaway, according to the St. Vincent news site iWitness News. Primus was deported to St. Vincent last year after serving a prison sentence for violating a restraining order, the New York Daily News reported. In 2006, police failed to collect DNA evidence linking Primus to Petro-Nixons murder, Pix11 reported. The NYPD did not return a request for comment Tuesday on whether he was a suspect in the case. Primus has not admitted to killing Petro-Nixon. However, Rev. Robinson said he hoped that would change. Were praying and hoping that between now and the rally, we get a confession out of him, Robinson said Tuesday.",0

1337,"Three men from across San Gabriel Valley face capital murder charges, and a fourth was arrested in the death of a young Glendora man whose body was discovered severely beaten and bloodied in the Angeles National Forest, authorities say. Glendora resident Hercules Balaskas, 18; Francisco Amigon of La Verne, 19; Jacob Hunter Elmendorf, 19, also of La Verne and most recently Matthew Luzon Martin-Capiendo, 21, of Montebello have all been arrested on suspicion of committing a brutal homicide in June. Deputies arrested Martin-Capiendo on Saturday, according to reports. Martin-Capiendo was the last to be booked on suspicion of murder, and was held without bail. He made his initial appearance at the Pomona courthouse on Monday, but his arraignment was rescheduled for Aug. 6. The four allegedly bludgeoned Julian Hamori-Andrade, 20, of Glendora at Martin-Capiendos Azusa-area home, then kidnapped, robbed and dumped him-- battered-yet-still-alive--down a hillside, where he died. Hamori-Andrades body was found around 6 p.m. May 30 in heavy brush about 30 feet down the hill alongside Highway 39 in Azusa Canyon, according to Deputy Trina Schrader of the Sheriffs Information Bureau. Prosecutors and sheriffs officials said the victim was beaten at a home in the 6100 block of Goodway Drive, where authorities found a large pool of blood on the floor on May 28, but no suspects or victim. Hamori-Andrade was then driven to Azusa Canyon, where again he was beaten and thrown over the side of the road, according to investigators. The other three suspects, all 19 years old, are acquaintances of the victim. They were identified as Hercules Balaskas of Glendora; Jacob Hunter Elmendorf of La Verne; and Francisco Amigon, also of La Verne. All four are charged with first-degree murder, residential robbery and kidnapping. The murder charges include the special circumstance allegations of lying in wait and murder during the commission of a kidnapping and a robbery. The defendants all face a possible death sentence if convicted, but prosecutors have yet to decide whether to pursue capital punishment. Sheriffs officials said the victim and suspects were all at Martin- Capiendos home when the victim was brutally beaten before being dragged to a pickup truck belonging to one of the suspects. Prosecutors contend Balaskas beat the victim with a metal chair, while Martin-Capiendo wielded a rock and broken glass pipe. A GoFundMe page was established for the family of Hamori-Andrade, and raised over $13,000 to aid in funeral costs for the family. According to that page, Hamori-Andrade was a father of one child, and was expecting another baby to be born sometime this year. Life can be unfair in the most heartbreaking ways. As of today, May 31st, our family lost an important piece of our hearts. Julian was a beautiful soul whos life ended in a terrible tragedy, Jasmine Hamori said on the GoFundMe page. At only 20 years old his life was taken from him, he lived his life the best way he could. Julian was an amazing brother, son, father and friend and will be missed beyond words.

On Tuesday, a multi-agency task force arrested Howard Dixon, 23, on charges of sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault in Montgomery County, and attempted kidnapping and aggravated kidnapping in Harris County. He is currently being held in the Montgomery County Jail with his combined bail amount set at $300,000.Dixons reign of terror in Harris County allegedly began with the attempted kidnapping of a woman in north Harris County at about 10:30 a.m. on Saturday. Fortunately for this young lady, there were some employees working on a yard crew, and they were able to rescue her from [Dixon], said Lt. Jeff Stauber, an investigator with the Harris County Sheriffs Office Violent Crimes Unit. Ten minutes after his first attempt, Dixon allegedly tried to kidnap 55-year old Luz Baena. Dixon allegedly got out of his car, grabbed Baena, and forced her into his car, and punched her in the face to subdue her. She decided she wasnt going to be victim, and she actually jumped out of the vehicle, Stauber said. Investigators were able to obtain video footage of Dixons car from neighborhood surveillance cameras, and shared the footage with media outlets throughout the Houston area. On Sunday, the sheriffs office received a tip that the car from the video was at a gas station filling up with gas. Investigators were able to get a clearer picture of the vehicle as a result, Stauber said. Just before 3 p.m. on Sunday, Dixon allegedly coerced a woman to get into his car and sexually assaulted her.She was forced to perform sexual activity against her will, said Detective Mike Lee, an investigator with the Montgomery County Sheriffs Office. The woman was able to escape from Dixon and call police with a description of his car. However, while police were investigating the sexual assault that occurred at Interstate 45 and Rayford Road, Dixon allegedly found another victim in the same area and sexually assaulted her as well, Lee said. In the second case, Dixon allegedly persuaded her to get in his car, where he strangled her and forced her to have sex with him, before she escaped. Stauber said based on Dixons aggression, he believes someone would have eventually been killed if Dixon hadnt been caught. Officials are hoping that if there are more victims, that they will come forward and talk with law enforcement officials Each of the felony charges carry a possible sentence of 5 to 99 years if convicted.

1343,"A detention hearing is set for a 28-year-old charged in the kidnapping of a University of Illinois scholar from China. A federal judge will decide at Wednesdays hearing in Urbana whether Brendt Christensen can be released pending trial. Hes accused of abducting 26-year-old Yingying Zhang on June 9 as she headed to sign an apartment lease off campus in Urbana. Authorities believe shes dead, though her body hasnt been found. (For more local news, click here to sign up for real-time news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) Judges consider two main factors in deciding whether suspects qualify for release. One is whether they pose a danger. The other is whether theyre a flight risk. Christensen lives in Champaign and has a masters degree in physics from the University of Illinois. He previously lived in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, If convicted, he would face a maximum life prison sentence. Christensens attorney Evan Bruno previously said he talked to Christensen a few times, but that this case is very young and we havent had a really full opportunity to develop everything yet. Bruno asked the public to be patient, to keep an open mind, wait till the evidence comes in. He described his client as a very intelligent guy who has no criminal history. He has a speeding ticket, I think, but thats about it, Bruno said. Bruno added that Christensen is married, but that he and his wife do not have any children, according to the newspaper. He said Christensen is not employed but has been looking for a job. Zhang, who received her masters degree in environmental engineering in China last year and hoped to eventually land a professorship and help her family financially, went missing on June 9. Her father traveled from China to Illinois in June for the search. Authorities announced that they believed she was abducted after viewing surveillance video showing her climbing into a vehicle. Authorities charged Christensen on Friday after federal agents heard him tell someone that hed kidnapped Zhang and held her against her will.

1344,"HAYWARD, CA- A 31-year-old man has been convicted of kidnapping to commit a sex crime, forcible rape and forcible oral copulation with aggravated kidnapping enhancements for sexually assaulting a woman in Hayward.

1345,"DuPage County States Attorneys Office said Friday that a man who was convicted of brutally murdering an Elmhurst woman in 1982 is not sexually violent under Illinois law. Thomas Kokoraleis, 57, was a member of the Ripper Crew, which killed and raped several women during the 1980s. Kokoraleis was supposed to be released from prison Sept. 29 after serving half of his 70-year sentence, but it was delayed because he didnt have an approved place to live. If Kokoraleis had been deemed sexually violent, he would not have been able to be released from prison. My office, along with the Illinois Attorney Generals Office, has worked closely with experts to determine whether it is legally possible for the State to prove to a court that Kokoraleis meets the requirements to be found a sexually violent person in order to be civilly committed after he has served his criminal sentence, DuPage county States Attorney Robert Berlin said in a release. Berlin said the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a person suffers from a mental disorder, and that mental disorder makes him dangerous such that it is substantially probable the person will commit acts of sexual violence. After evaluations by highly experienced psychiatrists and psychologists found Kokoraleis does not meet the necessary criteria, we are unable to ethically bring a petition to find that he is sexually violent under Illinois law, Berlin said. Kokoraleis was convicted of the 1982 murder of Lorraine Borowski of Elmhurst based on an accountability theory. According to the States Attorneys Office, this means he was held accountable for the acts committed by other individuals that resulted in Borwoskis death. Kokoraleis brother Andrew and another member of the Ripper crew, Edward Spreitzer were convicted for the murder and rape of Borowski. Andrew Kokoraleis, was convicted of the murders of Borowski and Rose Davis and was sentenced to death. He was executed in 1999. According to the States Attorneys Office, Spreitzer was convicted of the murders of Linda Sutton, Shui Mak, Rose Davis, Sandra Delaware and Raphael Tiradao — and is serving a natural life prison sentence with no possibility of parole. He was originally given a death sentence that was commuted when Governor George Ryan commuted all death sentences in Illinois. The last member of the killing group, Robin Gecht, was convicted of the attempted murder, rape, aggravated kidnapping and deviate sexual assault of a woman and is not eligible for parole until 2042. The States Attorneys Office said Kokoraleis admitted to participating in Borowskis abduction. While he denied he was involved in her rape and murder, Kokoraleis admitted he was present while Andrew Kokoraleis and Spreitzer raped and murdered Borowski. He was sentenced to 70 years in prison. Based on Illinois sentencing laws in effect when he was sentenced in 1986, Kokoraleis served 50 percent of his sentence and was scheduled to enter mandatory supervised release in September 2017. The States Attorneys Office said because the criteria for requiring an individual to register as a sex offender is different than the SVP Act requirements, Kokoraleis will be required to register as a sex offender when he is ultimately released from IDOC custody.

1357,"The convicted sex offender soon to go on trial for the kidnapping and murder of two Montgomery County sisters has told investigators multiple stories of what might have happened to the girls — from saying a minister took the Lyon sisters to accusing relatives of kidnapping and raping the girls to saying he helped plan their abduction. And in one interview with investigators Lloyd Lee Michael Welch Jr. even wondered whats gonna happen to me? Forty-two years ago, Sheila Lyon, 12, and Katherine Lyon, 10, vanished after a trip to a Wheaton mall. An attorney for Welch has filed a motion asking that his Sept. 12 trial be moved from Bedford County Virginia because publicity will not allow a fair hearing; a judge hasnt ruled on the request. The sisters were last seen walking home from the mall in March 1975. The bodies of the missing girls have never been found. Prosecutors in Montgomery County have charged Welch, who is locked up in a Delaware prison, with the first-degree felony murder of the girls. A judge ruled in January that prosecutors may seek the death penalty in the case. Local and federal investigators interviewed Welch several times while he serves time for child sex crimes in a Delaware prison. His response contradict his own statements and accuse both unknown suspects as well as at least two family members. WTOP reviewed the statements, part of the court documents recently filed ahead of the trial. In October 2013 Welch said a minister put the girls in a car near the mall, while in 2014 he said an unknown person put the girls in a car; later said his nephew led them from the mall; and in another interview said he and a girlfriend babysat the sisters during their captivity. In May 2015 Welch reportedly told authorities he knew where the girls were killed, although a specific site isnt mentioned. And he weighed talking with investigators against what he might gain, WTOP reports. I know I should be worried about the girls, the family, puttin it to rest and stuff like that but you also gotta look at it, Im a survivor, Welch told a Montgomery County detective, WTOP reports. … Ive also gotta think of me …, whats gonna happen to me? A judge ruled June 30 that the girls parents and two brothers may testify in the trial, and remain in the courtroom during the entire trial to watch the proceedings, WTOP reports. No decision has been made on whether the trial will be moved out of the community, which is home to Welchs extended family, and where investigators believe the girls were slain. The only physical evidence of the girls bodies appeared to be a tooth found on a remote Virginia mountain. But investigators have lost that piece of potential evidence that was listed in court documents ahead of the trial. Two of the most grisly pieces of evidence expected in the trial are the tooth and witness accounts of bloody bags that smelled like death, which police believe may tie Welch to the victims. But WTOP reports that the tooth has been lost while in the custody of the Bedford County Virginia Sheriffs Office; it went missing before experts could test it to see if it came from one of the girls. A representative for the Bedford County Sheriffs Office declined to talk with WTOP on how the tooth disappeared. Both sides of the case are under a gag order imposed by a judge, so prosecutors and defense attorney arent commenting on the development. The trial date for Welch has twice been pushed back. The original trial for Welch was Oct. 18, 2016, but a new trial date of April 2017 was set so his attorneys can wade through hours of interviews the suspect gave with police. In February it was delayed again and Welchs new trial date is Sept. 12, 2017. Montgomery County authorities believe the girls were taken to Taylors Mountain in the rural Virginia county – where members of the Welch family live and own land – and their bodies burned and hidden. In February 2015, investigators said they believed the girls were taken by the convicted sex offender and later sexually assaulted by his uncle, Richard Welch Sr., according to court documents. Investigators have searched for traces of the sisters in Bedford County. The area is the one-time home for both Welch men, authorities said. The listing of the tooth as evidence earlier this year was the first time investigators mentioned finding any human remains. Whether the tooth belongs to one of the missing girls is not specified in court documents. READ ALSO: Smell of Death According to affidavits in the case, a relative of Lloyd Welch told police that in the spring of 1975 he came by a house on Taylors Mountain unexpectedly with a duffle bag of bloody clothes that he wanted the relative to launder, reports WUSA. A cousin, Henry Parker, also told detectives he helped Lloyd Welch burn two 60- to 70-pound duffle bags stained red and smelling of decay, reports The Washington Postciting a search warrant. The bags smelled like death, Parker said in court documents. Parker told the Post in an interview that he didnt know what was in the bags that were burned on Taylors Mountain. He told the newspaper he didnt see the Lyon sisters. Other family members warned Parker to stay away from Lloyd Welch, saying: Hes trouble. Hes trouble all the way around. Family Members Suspected of Knowing Case Details Investigators have repeatedly said they suspect Lloyd Welchs relatives of knowing about his actions or those of his uncle, Richard Allen Welch Sr. of Hyattsville. The elder Welch has not been charged in the case, and although he has been named a person of interest in the case, he has consistently denied any wrongdoing. He has not been charged in the Lyon case, and his daughter says that her father is innocent. Patricia Ann Welch said that several extended family members who live in the Bedford County, Virginia, area have lied to the grand jury. A conspiracy to hide the fate of the Lyon sisters was formed in 1975 when relatives at Taylors Mountain failed to report what happened, she said. Yes, he did it, I think he did it 100 percent, Patricia Ann Welch of Hyattsville, the daughter of Patricia and Richard, told WTOP and The Washington Post in July 2016 of the charge against her cousin. Lloyd has done it to other people, thats what hes in jail for. Lloyd has molested other kids. I think hes implicating my dad because hes the only one left alive. Patricia Ann Welch said there is no way her father abused the sisters; she would have been 8 years old at the time the Lyon girls were taken and told WTOP she saw nothing amiss in her family home. At least 10 detectives have spent hours talking to Lloyd Welch, along with dozens of people who are potential witnesses. His attorney said that the investigation has yielded more than 1,900 pages of transcripts from police interviews, more than 29,000 electronic files that cover wire-tap information, interview notes, audio recordings and video recordings, and an additional 1,600 PDFs that go back to 1975, reports The Washington Post. When he goes to trial, prosecutors may ask for the death penalty, a Bedford County judge ruled in January 2017. The defense said Virginia didnt allow capital punishment when the girls disappeared, but the judge disagreed, WTOP reports. The judge also decided Welch breached an immunity agreement with Maryland prosecutors by changing his story multiple times, so statements Welch made to police in Maryland will be allowed at trial. Family Members Cross InvestigatorsSeveral of Welchs family members have been prosecuted for hindering the murder investigation.Leslie Joseph Engleking Sr., 69, of Alexandria, Virginia, in February pleaded no-contest to lying to police searching for the Lyon sisters. Engleking was sentenced in June to five years in prison for lying to the grand jury, but the entire sentence was suspended in favor of supervised probation. Authorities say since his arrest for perjury, Engleking has cooperated in the investigation. Along with Engleking, two other Richard Welch family members were charged with impeding the investigation into the sisters deaths. Gladys Stangee and Amy Johnson were charged with obstruction of justice. Stangee is Richard Welchs sister, and Johnson is his granddaughter. Pursuing All Leads Prosecutors said at a July 2015 press conference that the charge filed against Lloyd Welch includes the allegation that during his abduction of the sisters with the intent to defile them, he killed the girls.John McCarthy, the states attorney from Montgomery County, has pledged to continue to pursue anyone who harmed the girls, and those who have lied and misled investigators. Life was never the same for any parent who tried to raise a child after the disappearance of these little girls. Weve never forgotten the Lyon family or the Lyon girls, McCarthy said nearly two years ago. Capt. Darren Franke, head of the Major Crimes Unit of the Montgomery County Police, urged witnesses to come forward. I believe theres someone out there that knows a lot more than theyve shared so far, Franke said. If people have a lead, they can call (434) 534-9521 or email cybertip@ncmec.org. Timeline of Girls Disappearance The girls walked to Wheaton Plaza (now Westfield Wheaton Mall) on March 25, 1975, but never returned home, Patch previously reported. The Washington Post cited documents that say Lloyd Welch told detectives he took the girls when he left the mall the day they disappeared and that he later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the sisters at his home in Hyattsville. Police named Lloyd Welch a person of interest in connection with the kidnapping of the Lyon sisters in February 2014. Welch, who was charged with sex offenses against girls in several states, has been in a Delaware prison since 1997, according to police. Montgomery County Police said Welch was noticed paying attention to the sisters the afternoon they disappeared. His uncle was named a second person of interest in the abductions in October 2014. The elder Welch was a security guard in the Wheaton area during the time of the sisters disappearance, Patch previously reported. In an earlier letter to the Post, Lloyd Welch denied any involvement in the disappearance of the sisters. Richard Welchs daughter told the newspaper the allegations are a lie.

1359,"Javon Roberts, 15, of Mount Vernon was arraigned Wednesday on 28 felony and misdemeanor charges of rape, kidnapping, sexual abuse, criminal sexual act and others in connection with the sexual assaults of two females, one of whom was 11 years old. According to Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore, the first attack occurred in October 2014 when Roberts allegedly kidnapped a 23-year-old woman in Mount Vernon and forced her to perform oral and anal sex at knifepoint. The second incident occurred in December when Roberts is alleged to have kidnapped an 11-year-old - after a Christmas concert - forced her perform the same acts, also at knifepoint. The brutal and violent acts this defendant is alleged to have committed against these two victims, one an 11 year old girl, are extremely dangerous and disturbing, said DiFiore in a statement. We are thankful for the excellent detective work and forensic analysis performed in this case and we are most grateful for the courage displayed by these two victims in coming forward to assist in holding this defendant accountable for the depraved crimes he is accused of committing. Roberts has been remanded into custody and is next scheduled to appear in court in May. Below is DiFiores press release about the case: Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore announced that year old Javon Roberts(DOB 6/17/99) of 113 S.14th Ave., Mount Vernon New York has been arraigned today on a 28 count indictment charging him with: The brutal and violent acts this defendant is alleged to have committed against these two victims, one an 11 year old girl, are extremely dangerous and disturbing. We are thankful for the excellent detective work and forensic analysis performed in this case and we are most grateful for the courage displayed by these two victims in coming forward to assist in holding this defendant accountable for the depraved crimes he is accused of committing, said District Attorney Janet DiFiore. On October 20, 2014 between 6:30 pm and 7:30 pm the defendant abducted a 23 year old female walking home from work in Mount Vernon. Placing a knife to her throat he attempted to rape her but then determining that they were too exposed at their current location, forced her to come with him to the Grimes Elementary School Building located at 58 South 10th Street. There the defendant forced his victim to perform oral sex on him and then forcibly anally sodomized her multiple times. At the conclusion of the attack, the defendant walked the victim to the corner and let her leave. She immediately notified police who then attempted to locate the defendant to no avail. On December 4, 2014, an 11 year old female was walking home from a Christmas concert at a local library in Mount Vernon at approximately 8:00 pm. The defendant abducted her and once again took his victim to the grounds of the Grimes Elementary School. In a stairwell adjacent to the playground, the defendant pulled out a knife and forced the child to perform oral sex on him whereupon he also raped and anally sodomized her multiple times. When the child screamed in pain, the defendant said Shut up or I will kill you. The entire attack went on for approximately two hours. The victim was eventually let go. Police had no leads. Later, police interviewed the defendant on an unrelated investigation. The water bottle he drank from was handed over to the Westchester County Crime lab. Forensics was able to link the defendant to the two sexual attacks. The defendant was remanded. His next court appearance will be on May 12th, 2015. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison. Although the defendant is being tried in Criminal Court as he is under 16 years old, the defendant is considered a juvenile offender.

1361,"A 15-year-old boy pleaded not guilty today to all charges hes facing in the murder of 8-year-old Madyson Maddy Middleton at a Santa Cruz housing complex in July, prosecutors said. Adrian Jerry Gonzalez appeared today in Santa Cruz County Superior Court, where he was arraigned on felony charges of murder, kidnapping to commit another crime, sexual penetration by a foreign object, two counts of forcible lewd acts on a child and forcible rape on a child under 14 years old. The charges also include allegations of murder by lying in wait, causing great bodily injury and other sex crimes. Gonzalez has been charged as an adult in the case, prosecutors said.

1362,"Police say they have charged a Virginia man who led officers on a high-speed, 26-mile chase before a Maryland State Police cruiser rammed the stolen car he was driving on I-95 in Aberdeen as he tried to run down troopers The chase, which reached speeds up to 100 mph, began just before 3 p.m. Tuesday when Harford County Sheriffs deputies spotted a stolen silver Ford Taurus driven by Brandon L. Pegram, 23, a fugitive wanted after allegedly threatening his family with a shotgun and handgun Sunday in Stoney Creek, VA, Maryland State Police said. Harford County sheriffs attempted to initiate a stop and the vehicle fled, Harford County Sheriffs spokeswoman Officer Monica Worrell said. Harford deputies, state troopers, Baltimore County police, including air patrols, and the U.S. Marshals Office joined the pursuit. Pegram led them from U.S. 40 and Gateway Drive to White Marsh Boulevard in Baltimore County onto I-95 North, police said. There, he allegedly tried to drive into civilian cars before trying to run down troopers on the highway. Maryland State Police Sgt. Mark Yingling steered his cruiser into the Taurus, trapping the car against a guardrail near the Maryland House travel plaza, state police said. Pegram, who appeared Wednesday before a court commissioner at the Harford County Central Booking Center, faces first- and second-degree assault, vehicle theft, reckless endangerment and malicious destruction of property charges along with numerous traffic violations in the Tuesday chase. He was wanted on robbery, felony assault and kidnapping charges after allegedly threatening family members at the Virginia home. Pegram reportedly held his family hostage and had allegedly threatened to harm any law enforcement officers who attempted to apprehend him, Maryland State Police spokesman Greg Shipley said in a news release. Virginia State Police said Pegram had barricaded himself in a house in Stoney Creek, about 30 miles south of Richmond. When authorities entered the house early Monday morning, Pegram was gone, and police issued the warrants for his arrest. Virginia authorities also discovered a Ford Taurus owned by Dinwiddie County had been stolen, but it was unclear whether it was taken from authorities who came to the house during the standoff. Pegram, who police said was treated for minor injuries at a local hospital, was in the car alone, and officers found no weapons. No one else was injured, but there were several close calls. Just before the entrance to the Maryland House on I-95, the suspect attempted to ram citizen vehicles, Shipley said. Two sheriffs deputies, who were well ahead of the chase, got out of their cars to throw down markers telling motorists to stop. Pegram avoided the deputies by swerving, Maryland State Police 1st Sgt. Michael Wann said. Then Pegram continued his attempt to elude police. Pegram nearly struck the first deputy, then lost control and traveled across I-95, nearly striking the second deputy, Shipley said. The suspect then appeared to deliberately drive his car directly at the second deputy, who was able to dive out of the way before being hit.",0

1365,"A South Jersey man is among three people who have been arrested after engaging in lurid online discussions with an undercover cop who they believed was a child. All three suspects ultimately planned to meet the child for sex in Montgomery County, the District Attorneys Office announced on Tuesday. Joseph Picchi, 49 of Hammonton, was among three men who made separate overtures to the child, who was really a cop posing as a 14-year-old girl. The other two were 28-year-old Donovan Early, of Philadelphia, and 30-year-old Jonathan Uitto, of Consohocken, according to the District Attorneys Office. The suspects all shared sexually explicit photos with the girl, cops said, and discussed in detail their sexual plans. During the conversations, both over text and email, the undercover cop repeatedly told each man that she was only 14, according to the criminal complaints. Picchi agreed to meet the underaged girl on Jan. 25 in Conshohocken. Police met him at the agreed-upon place and arrested him on charges of statutory sexual assault, kidnapping, and related counts. Picchi failed to post $75,000 bail and was taken to Montgomery County Correctional Facility, with a preliminary hearing set for Feb. 28. Picchis arrest came eight days after Early was arrested at the same spot. He was arrested and charged with statutory sexual assault, attempted involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, and related counts on Jan. 17. Early did not make $150,00 bail and was also remanded to Montgomery County Correctional Facility. He then waived his preliminary hearing. Uitto did not come to meet the girl but was arrested on Feb. 14, police said. He faces charges of communications with a minor with obscene material, corruption of minors, and discussing explicit sexual material with a minor. Uitto posted $100,000 bail and was released. Hes slated to return for his hearing on March 1. The undercover efforts were spearheaded by a partnership between the Montgomery County Detective Bureaus Major Crimes Unit and the Pennsylvania Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.

1377,"Escondido police arrested a 46-year-old San Marcos man Tuesday who they say tried – and in one case, succeeded – luring five different teen girls into a vehicle in which he was stowing an illegal assault rifle. And authorities say Tuesdays attempted kidnappings were far from a first for Spicer Conant, who was booked on one count each of attempted kidnapping and felony possession of an illegal assault rifle. Additional charges may be pending. Conant was taken into custody around 8 a.m. Tuesday, March 21, after an 18-year-old woman reportedly took him up on his offer to enter his red Mazda Miata convertible. Surveillance officers immediately feared for the victims safety, they said, and pulled Conant over near 13th Avenue and Econdido Boulevard. Thats when they allegedly found an illegal assault rifle in his vehicle, according to an Escondido Police Department news alert. But Conants arrest was the culmination of a months-long investigation dating back to May 9, 2016. Attempted luring reports that afternoon included one in which a 15-year-old victim walking near Washington Avenue and Fig Street was approached by a 40-50 year old white male in a red convertible. The man, who police now believe to be Conant, asked her for directions and thereafter, offered her money to get into his car. She reportedly refused and walked away. On the same day at about 1:45 p.m., a 16-year-old female was approached in the same manner, asking for directions, said a news release that documents a laundry list of similar reports. She was offered $10 to get in the car, and she did. The male drove the minor around for several minutes before dropping her off. A witness observed the second May 9 incident and took photos of the vehicle with the minor seated inside. Local authorities then disseminated a press release featuring the vehicle and driver description. At (that) time of the investigation, it was determined no crime had been committed and the case was suspended, police said. That is, until this month, when attempted luring reports such as this one resurfaced in the area: Police then learned of a separate suspicious incident that occurred around 8:15 a.m. on Monday, March 20. Around that time, a 27-year-old woman said she was approached near the intersection of Broadway and El Norte Parkway by a man driving a red Mazda Miata. The victims description of the suspect matched that of Conant, police said. He asked her for directions, which she gave him, but he then asked her to get in his car, the news release said. She refused several times, but he persisted. The victim then took out her cell phone to take his photo and he sped away. Detectives in the Family Protection Unit then reopened the previously suspended 2016 case and launched a fresh investigation. That effort included Tuesdays surveillance of Conant, which started at 6:30 a.m. They followed him into Escondido where over the space of about 90 minutes, (he) attempted to get five different females into his car, all in the general area of Mission Ave and Broadway, police said, in a news release. The ages were 14, 15, 16, 16 and 18. Conant was arrested after he successfully coerced the aforementioned 18-year-old victim into his vehicle.  This investigation remained ongoing Wednesday morning.

A year later, Brazells body was found dismembered in a bloody bag on the A subway line, cops said. Brazells head was never recovered. Soon after Govan was arrested in connection with Thomas murder, investigators found that Govan had lived across the street from Brazell, and they started examining him as a potential suspect in the Brazell case, Boyce told reporters on Wednesday, the New York Daily News reported. Cops were able to link Govan to Brazells murder through physical evidence and Govans inconsistent statements to investigators, Boyce said. The NYPD Cold Case Squad said it solved the Thomas case based on DNA evidence recovered from Thomas fingernails that hadnt been tested before. The DNA results came up with Govan as a match, the Brooklyn DAs office said. Govan was already in a national database after he was arrested in Florida in 2014, and he was taken to Brooklyn to be tried for Thomas murder, a case that is still pending, the Brooklyn DAs office said. Govan refused to be arraigned in court by yelling and violently thrashing around in the court room on Thursday, witnesses reported. He is due back in court on March 3.

The AP and the Washington Post said they generally withhold the names of victims in sexual assault cases. Matthew also has been linked by DNA evidence to the killing of Hannah Graham, a University of Virginia student. Graham vanished in September, and her remains were found about five weeks later. In that case, Matthew faces charges in Albemarle County of capital murder, first-degree murder and abduction with intent to defile. No trial has been scheduled.",1
1385,"Danny Heinrich, who confessed to the abduction and murder of Jacob Wetterling in September after nearly 27 years, was sentenced to federal prison for 20 years Monday morning on one count of possessing child pornography. After serving his prison sentence, Heinrich will be on supervised release for the rest of his life. In a short statement during Mondays hearing, Heinrich, 53, apologized to Jacobs family, saying, Im truly sorry for the evil acts, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. Mr. and Mrs. Wetterling, Heinrich continued, the heinous acts of selfishness are unforgivable. Im so sorry. The hearing took place in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis. As expected, Judge John Tunheim sentenced Heinrich to 20 years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to one count of child pornography possession. Heinrichs guilty plea was part of a complex deal prosecutors struck in order to get him to confess the details of Jacobs murder. Because of the plea deal, though Heinrich confessed to killing Jacob and assaulting one other boy, Jared Scheierl, he will not face additional charges. Twenty years was the maximum sentence Heinrich could have gotten for the child pornography charge. We are getting stronger every day and we will deal with the finality of the search for answers, but like many other realities of life, healing has its ebbs and flows, the Wetterling family said in a statement released after the sentencing. We are felling good one moment and may be in tears from hearing a song that touches our hearts the next moment. Its OK. Its all part of the life management skills that we have had to acquire like so many other victims of violence crimes. KARE 11 reported Mondays hearing opened at 10 a.m., with Scheierl as the first person to make a victim impact statement. Scheierl said facing the man who abducted and assaulted him is something hes wanted for a long time. I was left that night to deal with a lot of emotions, questions, trying to seek clarity, Scheierl said, with Heinrich looking on. This is just one more step in gaining closure to incident in my life that has defined me in many ways. Heinrich confessed to abducting Scheierl in Cold Spring, Minnesota, January 1989, nine months before he killed Jacob. Last month, Patch published a five-part special report about the abduction and murder of Jacob Wetterling and other missing children in Minnesota and the Midwest. Aaron Larson, Jacobs best friend who was with him when the boy was abducted, spoke next. Oct. 22 1989, I considered that the end of my childhood, Larson explained. For 20 years I lived with guilt. Felt like a coward who left a friend. A coward who ran away. I hated it. I hated how I left him. I became the kid who was with Jacob. To me that became, the kid who left Jacob. I just wanted him to come home, he said. The Jacob Wetterling Resource Foundation released the following statement regarding Heinrichs sentencing: Heinrich wont be charged for killing Jacob because of a plea deal he struck with prosecutors. In October 2015, Heinrich was arrested and charged with possessing and receiving child pornography. These charges were pivotal to authorities striking a two-part agreement with Heinrich. According to the Pioneer Press, the first part of the deal with Heinrich was that he show authorities the location of Wetterlings remains and confess what he did to him. The second part was that Heinrich must plead guilty to a child pornography charge and admit that he abducted and assaulted Jared Scheierl in Cold Spring, Minnesota, nine months before he killed Jacob. Without Jacobs body, prosecutors werent able to pursue murder charges against Heinrich. Until Heinrich led investigators to Jacobs body, the only physical evidence authorities had against him were tire tracks and a shoe print, but they werent scientific matches. There wasnt even evidence proving that Jacob had died at all. Heinrich cant be charged in Scheirels case because the statute of limitations has expired, but the plea deal required Heinrich to publicly confess to the assault of the boy. In January 1989, nine months before Jacob was abducted, Heinrich abducted the Scheierl boy in Cold Spring, another small Stearns County town about 10 miles from St. Joseph. Jared was walking home from an ice rink when a man who later turned out to be Heinrich forced him into a car, sexually assaulted him and eventually let him go.

1386,"A man suspected of raping more than a dozen women is in Los Angeles Police custody, according to reports. The Los Angeles Police Department is expected to release details of the arrest at a Wednesday afternoon press conference. In the meantime, the Los Angeles Times, citing police sources, reported that the arrest involves a man suspected of raping at least a dozen women working as prostitutes. In December, warned the community of a serial rapist active in the South LA area since January of 2014. The armed attacker The suspect approaches females that are involved in prostitution activity, has a conversation with them, gets them in (his) vehicle, and then at gunpoint takes them to a remote area of the county near south Los Angeles, where he sexually assaults them, and then releases them, Los Angeles police Capt. William Hayes said at the time. The victims range in age from 15 to 46 years old, Hayes said. The abductions have occurred in the Alameda Corridor area, Hayes said. The corridor is a 20-mile-long rail cargo expressway linking the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to the rail network near downtown Los Angeles, according to the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority. Hayes said the man was linked by investigators to three cases via DNA evidence, and to the other cases based on his method of operation and other undisclosed reasons. The LAPD investigation began with a sexual assault in May of this year in the LAPD 77th Street Stations jurisdiction in south Los Angeles, Hayes said. DNA evidence was obtained from that victim that led investigators to a DNA match in a sexual assault case in sheriffs jurisdiction in January of 2014. A third case also was linked via DNA to the same suspect, Hayes said. Investigators compared those cases and others, and developed a pattern to the crimes, Hayes said.

1387,"Greenville County Sheriffs investigators said the man charged in the slaying of an eastside couple also knew the couples housekeeper. in the deaths of Gary Wells, 78, and his wife, Helen, 77, who were found dead in their home at 10 Terramont Drive Oct. 3. Deputies have charged Jonathan Donell Rhodes, 22, of Greenville with burglary, two counts each of murder, kidnapping and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime. Deputies said scientific evidence connected Rhodes to the crime and that Rhodes also was an acquaintance of the Wells housekeeper, Shirley Ann Rogers, 55, of Greenville. Rogers was arrested on fraud charges in the days following the killings. During Fridays announcement, Maj. Shea Smith said that Rogers was no longer employed by the Wells when she went to the house on Oct. 3. Rogers told WYFF, She (Helen Wells) never once told me not to come to work or not to come over there. Rogers also told the station she knew Rhodes because the two had done community service together. According to a SLED report, Rhodes was arrested in 2007 on a disturbing schools charge and in 2008 on a first-degree burglary charge, both in Greenville County. He was charged with two-counts of first-degree burglary and two-counts of armed robbery in 2009 in Pickens County. The Sheriffs Office is still investigating. According to a report by WSPA, deputies are still hoping to talk to a man who may have been seen in the area around the time of the killings.

1389,"A Kent State University professor said he believes the Cleveland man who allegedly held three women hostage for a decade used information control to hold power over the young victims, reports our partner WEWS News Channel 5. Dr. Jerry Lewis, a sociology professor, said he doesnt feel the term brainwashing applies because that implies cleaning out the brain and replacing it with a whole new system. Brainwashing means that you just eliminate who you were and its quite clear that didnt happen to some of the girls, Lewis said. He used Amanda Berrys dramatic 911 call to police as an example. She clearly stated that she had been missing for 10 years and had been on the news. She knew who she was and what happened to her. Lewis said he believes the suspect, Ariel Castro, 52, likely created a reward and punishment system, and strengthened his hold over the women through information control. Castro controlled the information flowing in. Plus, he probably distorted any information that did come in, that their parents didnt love them. Their parents dont deserve them, he said. Lewis, who has studied kidnappings extensively and teaches about cults, said Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight probably formed a three-person community, and their limited socialization, along with their young ages, may have kept their hopes alive. One of the things Im worried about is that the three girls probably created a community among themselves... I think there should be continual contact between the three young women, Lewis said. The professor said the victims will have to learn how to re-socialize themselves and it will be very important to reestablish ties with family, friends and their church. They should go back and recapture what they lost by reading a paper, looking at yearbooks and talking to old friends. They need to rebuild community. Police have said the women were tied up with ropes and chains at times. Dr. Lewis said it will take time for them to overcome their former world of isolation and distorted information. Theyll never the the same. People who have gone through these traumatic experiences always remember them, Lewis said. Click here for a NewsNet5.com video to accompany the story.",1

1391,"A man wanted on a warrant issued for an alleged kidnapping led authorities on a road chase Tuesday from Valley Center to Bonsall, where he ditched the SUV he was driving and made a failed attempt to escape on foot. Members of a U.S. Marshals Service fugitive task force requested help from sheriffs patrol deputies shortly before 11 a.m. while pursuing the suspect on Lilac Road in the area of Mesa Verde Drive. The wanted man, whose name was not immediately released, fled to the west and south for several miles, then abandoned his SUV in the 3600 block of Pico Road and ran off into a brushy area, sheriffs Lt. Jim Walker said. The pursuing personnel followed and took him into custody after a brief scuffle. Medics were called in to evaluate two deputies who suffered minor injuries during the chase and arrest, the lieutenant said.

1392,"Orlando, FL — Just more than a week after Omar Mateen walked into a crowded Orlando nightclub and opened fire on those gathered there, the FBI has shed more light on just what happened during the early morning hours of June 12. Ron Hooper, the FBIs special agent in charge, on Monday spoke of Mateens 911 calls to Orlando dispatchers the night of the worst mass shooting in American history. Mateen, Hooper said, was chilling, calm and deliberate during those calls. The FBI released transcripts of Mateens calls on Monday. The agency also provided a timeline of events that unfolded at the Pulse Orlando Night Club & Ultra Bar, a popular gay club. Audio of Mateens 911 calls and those placed by victims are not being released. Initially, authorities released only a partial transcript of calls, redacting Mateens pledges of allegiance to the Islamic State. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in interviews on various news channels on Sunday that the purpose of redacting the transcripts was to not re-victimize those that lived through the attack. Shortly after the transcripts were released, the government came under criticism for redacting the transcripts, prompting the FBI and the Department of Justice to release a joint statement with the full transcript from the 911 call. The purpose of releasing the partial transcript of the shooters interaction with 911 operators was to provide transparency, while remaining sensitive to the interests of the surviving victims, their families, and the integrity of the ongoing investigation. We also did not want to provide the killer or terrorist organizations with a publicity platform for hateful propaganda, the joint FBI and DOJ statement said. Unfortunately, the unreleased portions of the transcript that named the terrorist organizations and leaders have caused an unnecessary distraction from the hard work that the FBI and our law enforcement partners have been doing to investigate this heinous crime. As much of this information had been previously reported, we have re-issued the complete transcript to include these references in order to provide the highest level of transparency possible under the circumstances.  The FBIs investigation into Mateens past remains very much active, Hooper said. So does its probe into what motivated Mateen to kill 49 people and wound 53 others before he was shot and killed by authorities. Hooper on Monday said the FBI has found no evidence that Mateen was connected to an Islamic terrorist group. Instead, he said, the 29-year-old was radicalized domestically. Lynch is expected to visit Orlando on Tuesday. Lynch will be updated on the investigation and is expected to speak to survivors of the attack, authorities said Monday. The timeline and transcripts of the calls are as follows, quoted directly from the FBIs release of information. The transcript of the 911 call is not redacted, however the transcripts of the calls with hostage negotiators remain redacted: In a media release, the FBI noted that there were no reports of shots fired inside the Pulse nightclub between the initial exchange of gunfire with Mateen and the time of the final breach. The FBI is still asking for anyone with information about Mateen to contact it by calling 1-800-CALL-FBI or by going to tips.fbi.gov. Photo courtesy of the Orlando Police Department",0
1393,"New Brunswick, NJ - Three robberies occurred after midnight Friday night in New Brunswick, campus police said, two of which involved a gun and the third involved the victim being punched. This comes after a Rutgers student was violently robbed while walking behind the Cook/Douglass campus greenhouses on Thursday night, police said. This also comes after a woman said she was nearly kidnapped while walking alone downtown on Dec. 5. In response to the crime wave, Rutgers police are adding patrols in New Brunswicks 2nd, 5th and 6th wards. You will see a visibly increased police presence by the College Avenue campus, and the Cook/Douglass campus, Rutgers police vowed on Saturday. The first robbery occurred at 1:30 a.m. Saturday, police said, on Morrell Street between Sicard and Wyckoff streets. The victim, who is part of Rutgers University, said he was approached by two men, one of whom displayed a handgun and demanded items of value before fleeing the area on foot. The victim was not physically injured. The second robbery occurred at 2:45 a.m., on Mine Street near the intersection with Easton Avenue. This time, two victims said they were approached by an older African-American teen, about 18 to 20, who struck them with his fists, robbed them and then fled. A Rutgers police officer who was in the area chased him on foot, but the suspect got away. The victims, who were not part of Rutgers, sustained minor injuries but declined medical attention. Lastly, a third robbery was reported Saturday at 3 a.m. at the intersection of Nichol Avenue and Handy Street. A Rutgers student said he was approached by two men who offered to sell him marijuana. When he refused, the two men displayed handguns and forcibly removed items of value before fleeing the area on foot. The victim was not injured. Rutgers University Police say they are taking the crime spree seriously, and strategically adding more patrols to certain areas of the city because of it. Rutgers police also want to remind the community that they will provide security escorts upon request.

1394,"The war on deadly gang infiltration in Suffolk County continued Monday as Suffolk County District Attorney Timothy D. Sini announced the trial conviction of an MS-13 gang member who used the threat of brutal violence to attempt to recruit new members for the gang. The victims did not join; they did the right thing, Sini said. Thats why its critical that the Suffolk County District Attorneys office is here to protect the victims of not only gang violence, but also of gang intimidation. Juan Lopez, 32, of Huntington Station, was convicted by a jury of first degree attempted coercion, a felony, Sini said. On April 16, 2017, at approximately 1 p.m., Lopez and several other MS-13 gang members approached two young men at Manor Field Park in Huntington Station in an attempt to recruit them to join MS-13, Sini said. It was just five days after the murder of four young men near a park in Central Islip by alleged MS-13 gang members, Sini said. When the boys resisted, this defendant stated to them in unequivocal terms, This is how you end up dead in the park, Sini said. My message to Mr. Lopez is: Thats how you end up in jail in Suffolk County. Lopez was arrested by the Suffolk County Police Department on April 17, 2017. The case was prosecuted by the Enhanced Prosecution Bureaus gang unit, launched in January by Sini to focus exclusively on investigating and prosecuting crimes committed by gang members, such as members of MS-13. We are going to bring the fight against MS-13 to a whole new level, and that includes utilizing our penal law in innovative ways, Sini said. That includes putting an enormous amount of pressure on known MS-13 gang members.  Lopez faces a maximum sentence of one and one-third to four years of incarceration. He will be sentenced by State Supreme Court Justice Fernando Camacho at a later date. Since his election in November, Sini has pledged to crack down on the deadly MS-13 gang. We will not tolerate MS-13 in our communities, and my office is implementing an extremely aggressive strategy to combat gang activity in Suffolk County, he said. Under Sinis leadership, the Suffolk County District Attorneys Office has been reorganized to include the designated gang unit within the newly-restructured enhanced prosecution bureau; that unit will focus exclusively on investigating and prosecuting gang members in Suffolk County, the release from Sinis office said. The gang unit will work target gang members, coordinate efforts and intelligence with all gang-assigned law enforcement units in the region, and work to host prevention and intervention programs in the community. While serving as commissioner of the Suffolk County Police Department, Sini launched a multi-pronged strategy to eradicate MS-13 from Suffolk County, which included collaborative efforts to collect intelligence on gang members and share intelligence with partnering law enforcement agencies, enhanced and targeted police presence and patrols in affected areas, and significant investments in gang prevention and intervention strategies, he said. Efforts have resulted in more than 300 arrests of MS-13 gang members since September, 2016, Sini said in January. Spotlight on deadly MS-13 in Suffolk County Days after the gruesome discovery of four bodies in Central Islip on Long Island — the four young men are believed to have been victims of the deadly MS-13 street gang — the national and international spotlight has been on Suffolk County as lawmakers, educators and a horrified public try to shine a light on MS-13 and seek answers on how to stem the tide of escalating violence. The vicious murders have shocked a nation, with President Donald Trump speaking in Brentwood in July, 2017 about the insidious MS-13 gang thats been terrorizing local communities across Long Island in the county. And in his speech, he promised to rid the gang-ravaged communities of Long Island of the animals on their streets. MS-13 gang member, Trump said, are brutally violent. They dont like shooting people because its too quick, its too fast, he said. Instead, they knife them, cut them, let them die slowly because its more painful. These guys are animals. Long Island has been hit hard, with 17 beautiful young lives murdered since Jan. 16 on Long Island alone by July, 2017, he said. They butchered those little girls. They kidnap. They extort. They rape and they rob. They prey on children. They shouldnt be here, Trump said. MS-13 beats with victims with clubs, slashes them with knives and machetes, he said. They have transformed peaceful parks and beautiful, quiet neighborhoods into blood-stained killing fields. Theyre animals, Trump said. Putting the brakes on gang activity before recruitment In an effort to amp up efforts to tackle escalating gang violence and fight back against potential gang recruitment in schools, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the deployment of a new gang violence prevention unit, targeting 10 high-risk schools in Suffolk County in September, 2017. The gang violence prevention unit consists of 10 New York State troopers, deployed to the high-risk schools that serve as ground zero for gang recruitment and activity, Cuomo said. The 10 schools are reportedly in six targeted districts: Brentwood, Central Islip, Huntington, Longwood, South Country Central and Wyandanch. The goal, the governor said, is to put the brakes on deadly gang activity before young people even get recruited; the troopers will also seek to identify early warning signs of any potential gang activity in schools. At least one school district wasnt happy about the plan. At no point did any state official or otherwise reach out and ask what we need or dont need, Huntington School District Superintendent James Polansky wrote in a letter to members of the school district. The gang violence prevention unit was organized to coordinate with the Suffolk County Police Department to launch an Educate the Educators program, which will help teachers and faculty recognize the early warning signs of gang involvement and recruitment, a release from Cuomos office said. In addition, State Police will roll out a gang awareness curriculum directly to students to teach them about the dangers of gangs and foster a relationship between students and police, Cuomo said. Cuomo made the announcement on the one year-anniversary of the horrific murders of high-school students Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas by MS-13. The new initiative follows earlier initiatives by Cuomo to expand access to state intelligence and law enforcement assets in the fight against MS-13. In April, 2017, the governor launched expanded patrols in Brentwood and Central Islip, providing an additional 25 state troopers and added six investigators to the FBI-led Long Island Gang Task Force. Our number one job in government is to keep all New Yorkers, and especially our children, safe. By partnering with our schools, we will be better prepared to stop gang activity before it starts and end this heinous cycle of violence, Cuomo said. This is just one step in our ongoing efforts to eradicate the threat of MS-13 and ensure that every student remains on the path to a bright future. MS-13s insidious spread MS-13, which was formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s by immigrants fleeing El Salvadors civil war, is known for its brutal violence, including machete attacks and home invasions. But for all the public outcry, for those directly impacted by the quadruple homicide in Central Islip, the heartbreak is deeply personal.  One former MS-13 members story Trying to illuminate the dark reality of an MS-13 members life, *Elmer — his real name was withheld to protect his identity — a former MS-13 member who was able to escape the gangs tentacles and is now a member of Council for Unity, shared his story with Patch. Council for Unity is a non-profit organization based in Brooklyn that works with schools and jails to help gang members find a new path and self-empowerment through education and lessons in leadership, self-expression, mediation, conflict resolution and advocacy, according to the groups website. Telling his story, Elmer said: I joined the MS-13 gang right after my mom died. I was 8-years-old. The gang was, for me, a new life, a new family. After an initiation when he was jumped, Elmer said, They showed me everything I needed to know and then I started a new life by busting gangs, robbing, beating our enemies, doing any type of drugs every day, every night, shooting people, drinking every day. When he was 13, Elmer said he was shot three times and almost lost his leg. Ive been shot, stabbed almost to the point of dying and still didnt come to my senses. I spent my young life mostly in jail because of the violent and criminal things that I did. I lost two of my best friends when I was 15, he said. And then came Council for Unity, he said. God gave me a second chance, Elmer said. The Council for Unity helped me to stay away from gangs, showed me the other way of life, the other way to live without being a gang member, showed me love, the love I was looking for, the support and real brothers and sisters that I didnt have, a family to trust, a family to talk to. Council for Unity saved my life. Elmer said he made the decision to leave the gang because he was tired of seeing young people on the street getting killed every day. I was tired of funerals. Tired of watching kids join gangs, doing drugs in their early age. I decide to change when I saw two friends get hit with a straight bullet . . Ive made too many mothers cry. I refuse to let another tear be shed because of me. Today, Elmer is working, has a family and a new life. Getting out of a gang is hard, he admitted. You might be beaten or killed. You think being in a gang is cool? Youre wrong. All its going to do is bring is problems to your life. If knowing gang life was so surrounded by death, I dont know how anyone could want to get into a gang. The way out is not by the guns and violence — it is by using our minds. How did they get here? Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa outlines MS-13s migration to Long Island The recent murders have put the insidious gang violence on Long Island on the international canvas, with the world watching and wondering how such gruesome violence has come to infiltrate sleepy, suburban communities. Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, a non-profit volunteer safety patrol organization whose members are known for their trademark red berets, spoke to Patch about the path MS-13 has taken to Long Island. There was a very violent civil war in El Salvador from 1980 to 1992. In 12 years 75,000 people were killed. It created a refugee crisis and many El Salvadorians fled North to Los Angeles. They settled in Mexican neighborhoods and immediately were preyed upon by the largest Los Angeles street gang, the 18th Street gang, which got started in Los Angeles in 1965, he said. In order to protect themselves from the 18th Street gang, the El Salvadorians formed MS-13 and started to defend their turf. And even though they were outnumbered they proved to be durable and extremely vicious, he said. The Mexican Mafia, which controlled the Latinos in the California prison system, had MS-13 join their ranks, Sliwa said. This larger group was referred to as the Surenos. Thats why, to this day, MS-13 is sometimes referred to as SUR-13. But their enemy continued to be 18th Street gang — and that is similar to what exists presently in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. It is MS-13 vs. 18th Street. MS-13, with this newfound strength had more protection in the barrios and prisons of Southern California, he said. Next, Sliwa said, as El Salvadorians migrated east, looking for work, they landed in large numbers, first in Fairfax County, Va,. which is right outside of Washington, D.C. They then followed the trail up into Nassau and Suffolk counties, where there was a lot of day laborer work, he said. In the early 90s they embedded themselves into Fairfax County and in the late 90s they began to spread into Long Island. Along the way, MS-13 started to recruit Guatemalans and Hondurans who were also being picked on by the Mexican 18th Street gang. MS-13 uses the machete as a weapon of terror. They will slash their victims, slice off fingers and limbs and on occasion, behead their intended targets. The machete is a hallmark of bloody MS-13 crime, Sliwa said. The weapon of choice for MS-13 is the machete, which can be homemade in metal shops or garages, he said. Unlike other gangs, which prefer guns, Ms-13 uses the machete as a weapon of terror. They will slash their victims, slice off fingers and limbs and on occasion, behead their intended targets. It is done to silence any potential snitches. Since their main form of getting money is to shake down and extort their own community, the machete spreads fear to those who are being extorted. The machete, he added, is also a weapon that is used to do field work and gardening and can easily be transported around to do work. But its secondary purpose is to spread fear, Sliwa said. Life in the MS-13 gang Sliwa said those who join or affiliate themselves with MS-13 have been initiated into, or joined, a para military group with a strong code of internal discipline. To slight, diss or repudiate your membership in MS-13 means that you are to be disciplined. There are weekly meetings and dues that are to be paid. To ignore these responsibilities of being a member of MS-13 will earn you a brutal beatdown. MS-13 is paranoid about those who are perceived to be snitches, he said. Gang members have nothing to lose Robert DeSena, president and founder of Council for Unity, said many who want to join MS-13 are beaten as a form of initiation. They have different modes of assault. Theyre ruthless. Theyre violent and come from an extremely violent county. For many MS-13 gang members recruited young, whose agendas include unspeakable acts of brutality, DeSena said. Gang members come from El Salvador, an intense link, he said. If they get deported, they will be killed. They have nothing to lose, he said. Trying to infiltrate them? Its easier to infiltrate the mob. Unaccompanied minors and gang activity on Long Island According to Suffolk County Sheriffs Office Chief of Staff Michael Sharkey, with amped up enforcement efforts, gang members are now trying to become less identifiable. A lot of gangs are trying to blend in, Sharkey said. They used to have noticeable tattoos, but thats now seen as counterproductive to their carrying on their gang business. In a 2017 interview with Patch, Sgt. Steve Lundquist, an investigator for the Suffolk County Sheriffs Office gang intelligence unit, said specifics of the Central Islip murder investigation could not be discussed due to the ongoing case. But he said the murders have put a spotlight on gang activity on Long Island. And rightfully so. Once its young kids, getting killed, young girls getting killed, it really gets peoples attention. Discussing MS-13s presence in Brentwood and Central Islip, Lundquist said the demographics of the area have changed, with communities inundated with individuals of Central American descent. Not to say theyre bad people, but when a new group does come in, sometimes they are the minority in that area, and gangs form for protection. After awhile, when the area changes, their population increases and they become the dominant group in that area. MS-13, he agreed, became a presence on Long Island in the late 90s, but not with the numbers we have now. Today, Lundquist said, families have grown and brought new family members to the area. A lot of people from El Salvador have heard about Brentwood, so they flock there, he said. Unaccompanied minors in the area have been linked to gang activity, Lundquist said.Because they are unaccompanied, they are looking for a place to live, looking for food, looking for people that will take care of them, he said. The gang is very attractive, to help them out, give them a place to live, feed them. Thats one of the ways to recruit them, to become members of a gang — they have no place else to turn sometimes. Many unaccompanied minors, he said, come from areas of El Salvador where MS-13 runs a lot of the country. Some are already MS-13 members when they arrive in the United States, or have grown up with MS-13 family members. They dont know anything different, he said. Recruitment happening wherever kids congregate Recruitment, Lundquist said, is happening in schools, streets, anyplace where people openly congregate, with most kids initiated between 12 and 15-years-old. If theyre going to recruit them, they get them when theyre young and impressionable and dont know better, he said. Some kids who resist recruitment could be killed, Lundquist said, because MS-13 gangs are afraid those potential recruits will be scooped up by the rival 18th Street gang. MS-13 violence, he agreed, is marked by deadly machete use and for violent robberies and home invasions, with less of an emphasis on drug dealing, which is seen more with Latin Kings, Bloods and Crips. Rep. Peter King, R-Seaford, agreed that a federal program that allows unaccompanied minors to cross the border is a critical issue; he said hes had extensive conversations with Sini — and of the MS-13 arrests made, more than 50 to 70 percent were unaccompanied minors, King said. There are more than 4,000 unaccompanied minors in Suffolk County, King told Patch in 2017. Unaccompanied minors who come to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, are placed with families that have been threatened by MS-13 or paid by MS-13, King said. Its believed, King said, that MS-13 is gaming or using the system to get young people placed with Suffolk County families and subsequently, bolster MS-13 ranks. HHS, he said, is not a law enforcement organization, and therefore, there is a question of how extensive their investigation is or how equipped they are to do an investigation. King said there is definite pressure for kids to join gangs, with the threat of violence for those who wont join. Police have told me that kids who dont join get beat up pretty badly, theres definite pressure — a definite risk of being killed, he said. A brighter future Looking forward, Lundquist said, the way to stem gang violence is through outreach.Kids need to have better options, better family support, better community support, he said. Keep them busy playing sports and doing things, not in the streets.

1397,"A Georgia man who shot and killed his estranged wifes father before abducting his wife and her sister is scheduled for execution by lethal injection on Tuesday. Late Monday, the State Board of Pardons and Paroles denied clemency for William Sallie. His execution is set for 7 p.m. at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson. Sallie was sentenced to death for the March 1990 murder of John Moore. He had already abducted the couples 2-year-old son and moved to Illinois when he returned to Georgia and rented a mobile home in Liberty County under an assumed name. He had a friend buy a 9-millimeter pistol for him and, on March 28, 1990, went to the home of John and Linda Moore — his wife, Robins parents — where he cut the phone line while Robin was talking to her boyfriend. At about 12:45 a.m., Sallie pried open a back door of the home, went into the master bedroom and shot John and Linda Moore. John was hit six times, including two shots that damaged his heart, and died. Linda was shot in the thumb, the shoulder and both thighs. Sallie went outside to reload and Robin and her 17-year-old sister, April, pleaded with him to let them get help for her parents. Instead, he re-entered the home and handcuffed a bleeding Linda Moore to Justin, Robins 9-year-old brother. He then bound Robin and April to each other with handcuffs and duct tape. He took the two of them to his Liberty County mobile home, where he assaulted them both. After a few hours, Linda and Justin managed to get themselves free and get to a neighbor, who called police. Sallie released Robin and April in Bacon County the night of March 29, after asking them not to press charges. He was arrested shortly thereafter. If his execution goes ahead as scheduled, Sallie would become the ninth Georgia inmate executed this year and the 68th since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. If executed, Sallie will be the 46th inmate put to death by lethal injection. There are presently 58 men under death sentence in Georgia. For his last meal, Sallie requested a medium pizza with sausage and pepperoni, chicken wings with buffalo sauce and a large soda. Photo courtesy Georgia Department of Corrections",1

1399,"A village resident recently reported that he had received fraudulent text messages claiming that his son had been kidnapped and demanding a ransom. The text messages also contained a photo of the mans son. Westchester County police determined that the texts were coming from overseas and the photo had been obtained from the mans Facebook page. Officers assisted the man in changing the privacy settings on his Facebook page and in blocking any additional texts from the overseas number. County police said the intended victim of this scam knew where his son was and that his son was safe. But he wanted to report the fraud attempt to the police. They warn that this is a scam that often targets senior citizens. Sometimes the claim is that a child or grandchild has been arrested and bail money needs to be sent. Other times, as in this instance, the claim is that a kidnapping has occurred and a ransom is required. Anyone who receives a similar email or text, and has a concern about the safety or status of a relative, can contact the police for assistance. Never send anyone any money in response to contacts of this kind, county police said. Also, county police said: As for social media, some users do prefer to use the least-restrictive privacy settings to enable the most people to see their postings. Be aware that this might expose you to fraud attempts because people you dont know can access personal information from your postings, including the names of family members and details on anyone in the family who is on vacation or traveling on business out-of-state or overseas.

1401,", pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder during a Wednesday morning arraignment. Halgren was arrested at McNeil Island earlier this month in connection with the Lowe case, which had been cold and without leads for more than 30 years. Lowe was strangled in her apartment near Bellevue College the night of April 23, 1980, according to charging papers filed by the Bellevue Police Department. Her roommate discovered Lowe the next morning in their apartment at 2501 148th Ave SE, then known as the Quorum Apartments, now known as the Carrington Apartments. Investigators say that evidence shows that Lowe also was raped. Halgren, a resident of McNeil Islands Special Commitment Center, was identified last year via DNA obtained from sperm found at the scene in 1980, according to police. Halgren, 56, is being held on no-bail in King County jail. If convicted as charged, he faces life in prison, according to the King County Prosecuting Attorneys office. Halgren, who was 23-years-old in 1980, grew up at his parents home in on 151st Avenue SE in Bellevue, three blocks away from Lowes apartment, according to Bellevue Police Det. Jerry Johnsons statement in the court papers. Halgren had not been identified as a suspect until the DNA match made last year, said Bellevue Police Department spokeswoman Officer Carla Iafrate earlier this month According to Johnsons statement, the DNA evidence in the Lowe case was filed into the Washington State Patrol Crime Lab database in 2001. It hit a match with Halgren in 2012, when the database was updated to include civilly committed sexually violent predators at the McNeil Island Special Commitment Center. Lowe was last seen alive around 7 p.m. April 23, 1980, when she told her roommate that she planned to stay in and watch the Seattle Supersonics game on television, according to the court documents. Around 10 p.m. that night -- while Charlies Angels was on TV -- Lowes neighbors heard a knock at Lowes door, then a banging noise as if something hit a wall, running sounds and a muffled scream, but did not act on what they heard, according to the charging papers. Lowes roommate discovered her the next morning, positioned and covered in her bed, in what investigators said was an attempt to make her look like she was asleep, according the court papers. Halgren had been civilly committed at McNeil Island after a history of past sexual related convictions, according to the press release. Halgrens criminal history included a conviction in the 1989 kidnapping and rape of a woman in Bellevue, and other sexual related crimes in Seattle. Bellevue detectives interviewed Halgren in connection with the case last year. According to Johnsons statement in court papers, Halgren told detectives that in 1980, he worked at the Boeing plant in Bellevue on Kamber Road, and he told detectives that after work he would either go home to Fall City, go to his fiancees apartment in Bellevue or buy marijuana from a dealer who lived across the street from the Quorum Apartments. According to court papers, Halgren said he didnt know Lowe and disputed the validity of the DNA match. Lowes roommate, who was re-interviewed, said she never heard Halgrens name come up or recognize his photo. Bellevue detectives arrested Halgren on Jan. 9 at McNeil Island, and he was transferred to King County Jail on a no-bail bond, according to the press release. The case went cold in the 1980s after all investigative leads were exhausted, but Bellevue detectives continued to investigate the case on and off for the next three decades, Iafrate said.",0
1402,"Twenty-five years after she was abducted and murdered, Illinois State Police say they havent forgotten about Tammy Zywicki, the 21-year-old South Jersey woman who left Evanston on Aug. 23, 1992, heading back to college in Iowa. She never made it. Nine days after the Evesham Township natives broken-down car was found abandoned on Interstate 80 near LaSalle, the Zywickis body was found wrapped wrapped in a blanket hundreds of miles away on a highway in rural Missouri. Shed been stabbed to death. No one has ever been arrested in the college seniors death, and an ex-con trucker considered the prime suspect by a former Illinois State Police investigator died of AIDS in 2002. In 2012, as the 20th anniversary of Zywickis death approached, state police said they were pursuing promising new leads in the case. But five years later, it remains unsolved. On Tuesday, Illinois State Police said the case remains active. The FBI and ISP continue exploring new leads, examining 200 items of evidence and retesting items with modern DNA testing, police said in a news release marking 25 years since Zywicki was last seen along a stretch of I-80. Zywicki had reportedly dropped her brother off at Northwestern University in Evanston and was making the trek to Grinnell College in Iowa. She was last seen alive between 3:10 and 4 p.m. Aug. 23, 1992 near mile marker 83. Some witnesses said they saw a tractor-trailer parked behind her broken-down car, a white 1985 Pontiac T1000. Other witnesses said they saw a pickup truck, according to the Daily Herald. According to state police, the truck driver was described as a white male between the ages of 35 and 40 and over six feet tall, with dark, bushy hair. The day she vanished, Zywickis abandoned car was found and ticketed by a state trooper. The car was towed from the scene on Aug. 24, 1992, the same day her mother called state police to say her daughter had never arrived at college. On Sept. 1, 1992, Missouri state troopers, alerted by a passing motorist, found her body wrapped in a blanket sealed in duct tape along I-44 in rural Lawrence County, Missouri, between Joplin and Springfield. The 21-year-old had reportedly been sexually assaulted and stabbed seven times in a circular pattern near her heart. Shed also been stabbed in the right arm, and had duct tape over her mouth, according to the Des Moines Register. Police said some of Zywickis personal items have been missing since her disappearance, including a Cannon 35mm camera and a Lorus brand musical wristwatch that played the tune Raindrops Keep Fallin On My Head. The watch, seen in this photo released by Illinois State Police, had a green umbrella on its face and a green band. Ex-state police investigator Marty McCarthy told the Daily Herald his prime suspect, trucker Lonnie Bierbrodt, reportedly gave his wife a musical watch similar to the one Zywicki owned. In 20 years, lets face it, no other suspect has come forward other than Bierbrodt. Hes a helluva suspect, McCarthy said in 2012. Bierbrodt, who died in 2002, was questioned but never charged, and the watch was never found. But ISP Master Sgt. Jeff Padilla said he believes Tammys killer is still alive. We are treating this investigation as a brand new investigation, he said in 2015. A red and white soccer patch with the monogram St. Giles Soccer Club, Greenville, South Carolina, was also taken from Zywicki, state police said. In 2015, mother JoAnn Zywicki, who now lives in Florida, said she was still holding onto hope that her daughters murder would be solved. It never really goes away, she told the Sioux City Journal. Tammys father, Henry Hank Zywicki, died in 2015. A quarter-century after her death, Zywicki is still featured on the front page of the FBI website, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to the identification of her killer or killers. Anyone with information on Tammy Zywickis murder is asked to contact the ISP at (815) 726-6377, or the FBI Chicago Field Division at 312-421-6700. Callers can remain anonymous.

1403,"A Missouri man connected to two Kansas City-area females who disappeared about 10 years apart was charged Thursday with their murders. Cass County authorities charged Kylr Yust with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of abandoning a corpse in the deaths of Kara Kopetsky, 17, of Belton, and 21-year-old Jessica Runions of Raymore. He is being held on $1 million bond. Authorities had long suspected Yust was involved in the Kopetskys and Runions disappearances. Runions was seen leaving a gathering with Yust before she disappeared in September 2016 and Kopetsky had filed a protection order against Yust in April 2007, a month before she went missing after walking out of Belton High School. In April, a mushroom hunter found human remains in a wooded area south of Belton. Runions remains were identified quickly but Kopetskys remains werent positively identified until August. Yust was already jailed on a charge that he burned Runions car. Online court records do not indicate that Yust has an attorney. In the years after Kopetsky disappeared, Yust had confessed to friends, roommates and cellmates that he had killed her because he was upset that she wanted to end their on-and-off relationship, according to a probable cause statement released Thursday. (For more information on this and other neighborhood stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts.) He allegedly had kidnapped Kopetsky as she left her job about a week before she disappeared and drove around for several hours arguing before she was allowed out of the car. Phone records showed Yust and Kopetsky had exchanged phone calls within minutes of her leaving Belton High School on May 4, 2007, the last time she was seen alive, the statement said. A friend told police in April 2010 that Yust had told him about his volatile relationship with Kopetsky.(The witness) stated Yust then told him the victim K.E.K. wouldnt love him and that he was angry with her because he didnt want her to love someone else, according to the statement. Yust then told (the witness) that he had just snapped, and that something bad happened to the victim. Other witnesses told investigators that Yust confessed to choking Kopetsky to death and said he stared at her body for a long time before putting the body in a car and taking it to the woods. He also said no one would ever find the body, the statement said. In the Runions case, witnesses told police she and Yust were arguing and he was being possessive toward her before they left a party in Grandview. Two days later, Kansas City firefighters responded to a burning vehicle report and determined the car belonged to Runions. A friend told police he was with Yust when he burned the vehicle and took him to his house to recover after Yust suffered burns on his hands and face. The friend notified Belton police that Yust told him he had strangled Runions and taken her body into a wooded area, according to the statement. Yust was arrested on Sept. 11, 2016 at an Edwards, Missouri, mobile home. (Kansas City, Mo. Police Department via AP, File)",0

1407,"A 3-month-old baby who was kidnapped when she was left in a running vehicle stolen from outside a Detroit mini-market about 1 a.m. Sunday — and whose father didnt report her missing until two hours later — was found unharmed on a porch, where her abductors apparently left her after an Amber Alert was issued, police said. In a news conference announcing that the baby, Dakota Grimes, was found safely in her car seat on a porch on the 16600 block of Lakepointe Monday morning, Detroit Police Chief James Craig said he was angry with Dakotas father, a 30-year-old man who wasnt named in media reports. I will tell you and I explained it just this way to him, I said, Im angry with you. Why would you be out at 1 a.m. with a child? Craig said, according to a report in the Detroit Free Press. Now I understand he did drop the mother off, but it was not just so much being out at 1 a.m., it was the fact that he left the child in the car with it running, Craig said. Thats a recipe for what? A bad situation. Police said Dakotas father left his white Chevrolet Impala running outside of the Whittier Mini Market about 12:54 a.m. He exited the store to find it stolen, but didnt report his child missing until about 3 a.m. Dakotas father, who isnt a suspect, reportedly explained to police that he didnt report the abduction right away because he was trying to find his daughter. Michigan State Police were advised about 3 a.m., but an Amber Alert wasnt immediately issued because of a procedural problem. The delay is under investigation. Gary Zielinski, 65, told The Detroit News he found the baby about 7:15 a.m., when he arrived at his contractor friend Ray Harpers home before they began their workday. Houses on either side of Harpers home are vacant, and if Dakota had been left at either of them, she might not have been located so quickly. Its a miracle they picked the right house, Zielinski told The News. Little Dakota was cold — it was about 39 degrees outside when she was found — but unharmed. She was taken to the hospital for a through checkup. Police are still looking for the vehicle — license number CPG8598 — and the three suspects. The car has heavy damage to the right rear, police said. The right rear of the vehicle is heavily damaged. Image credit: Detroit Police Department",1

1413,"SAN FRANCISCO-FBI officials announced in San Francisco this week that the number of bank robberies in Northern California fell in 2015 for the second year in a row, but they are still searching for suspects in several high-profile cases - including Campbell and Felton - that remain unsolved. Bertram Fairries, of the FBIs San Francisco office, said Northern California bank robberies decreased to 102 in 2015, down from 152 in 2014 and 229 in 2013. In Campbell, two men who robbed a Wells Fargo Bank branch on Nov. 21 are being sought. The two men - armed with guns and wearing black hooded sweatshirts and masks - ordered everyone in the bank to get on the floor, forced an employee to open the bank vault and fled to a waiting white VW Jetta, which was occupied by one or two more suspects. The VW was later found abandoned on Kuehnis Drive (the street directly behind the bank). Witnesses saw the suspects get out of the VW and get into a green pickup truck. The green truck was later located a short distance away on Phantom Avenue. Both vehicles were determined to be stolen. In the Felton robbery, the FBI says a white man about 510 to 60 and likely left-handed entered the Liberty Bank at 6230 Highway 9 about 1:30 p.m. on July 13, 2015 and produced a handgun. He threatened the employees and customers, took hostages, and robbed the bank after moving the employees and customers into the vault area. He then fled on foot with a large sum of money in a backpack. He was seen wearing a white shirt and hat. FBI authorities theorize there may be several reasons for the drop: Fairries had advice for members of the public who find themselves caught in the midst of a bank robbery. Safety is the most important, he said. Be quiet, dont do anything to draw attention to yourself, but observe. People with information about these robberies or any others are urged to call the FBI at (415) 553-7400, the Santa Cruz County Sheriffs Office at (831) 461-7400, or the Campbell Police Department at (408) 866-2101.

1417,"A man wielding an axe kept police at bay for more than two hours at a Hartford apartment complex Tuesday morning before finally being disarmed. At 7:57 a.m., police responded to a 911 call from a resident of the Carriage Place Apartments at 30 Forest Street, complaining of an unknown person banging on their apartment door. Responding officers observed the door to apartment C5 was splintered with marks consistent of an axe or sharp object being pounded into it. A resident told officers that they heard the banging and saw the tenant from a specific apartment yelling and screaming in the hallway, Deputy Chief Brian Foley said. Officers walked over to the apartment, when suddenly, an emotionally disturbed person exited the apartment wielding an axe, approximately 3 to 4 feet in length. The man raised the pick axe to shoulder length, and a nearby officer, fearing for his safety and the safety of the residents, drew his firearm and attempted to get the man to drop the axe. The man retreated back into his apartment and locked the door, Foley said. Backup officers were summoned, interior and exterior perimeters were established, and a police officer trained in hostage negotiation and crisis intervention began talking to the man. It was determined that he was the only person in the apartment, but had mentioned several times he had a gun and wanted to shoot the place up, Foley said. The building was evacuated, and nearby Hartford Public High School was placed on precautionary lockdown until the situation could be resolved as a SWAT team was called to the scene, Foley said. The negotiating patrol officer attempted unsuccessfully to calm the man as the SWAT team arrived and set up a perimeter. Eventually the man went silent and stopped responding to negotiators, Foley said. In fear that the man actually had a firearm and would go through with his threat or harm himself or others, the SWAT team was directed to make entry and secure the man. At 10:06 a.m., SWAT personnel breached the door and the man was secured without incident. He was transported by EMS personnel for medical evaluation, Foley said. No injuries were reported. The high school was taken off lockdown and residents were allowed back in the building, according to Foley. This potentially deadly situation was skillfully handled without the use of violence, Foley said.

1421,"When drivers of vans approached two children in small Story County , the children ran off and their parents called law enforcement officers immediately. Reports of abduction attempts, similar to these local cases, have spiked since two girls disappeared in Evansdale in July. Police are calling it an abduction. Such attention and reaction was rare before high profile cases like Johnny Gosch in Des Moines and the murder of Adam Walsh, which inspired the television show Americas Most Wanted, caught Americas attention in the 1980s. Officers, who have worked in law enforcement since the 1980s, said the way they respond to missing cases has not changed but the technology has. They can make use of Amber Alerts, websites, telephone alert services such as A Child is Missing and have learned how to make better use of the media. Story County Sheriff Captain Thomas Barry said missing persons and abduction cases are all resolved using the same good police work: by asking questions and following up on diligent leads.  Story County Sheriff deputies said they always send a deputy for each reported missing persons and abduction attempt. Sgt. Rod Bunn said they treat all reports as if the person reporting them is honest and go from there. Rarely, if ever, does the Sheriffs Office ever receive a true missing person case, but parents often call to report that a child isnt where parents thought they should be and thats exactly how the sheriffs office wants it. Time is of the essence, said Barry, especially in the case of a missing child. The bottom line is, if you as a parent think there is something suspicious going on, call us right away, Barry said. Thats exactly what an Ames mother did when a woman reportedly asked her children if they knew the owner of the black and white dog she had with her. The report lead to a Facebook post on Aug. 20 from someone who heard the story: Ames Friends~ WARNING!!!! Today two boys were approached as they were walking to ACE HARDWARE. They were asked to look at a dog that a male and female found. They are driving a red or maroon van. Thank God they knew what to do...they are safe. Mom was watching from her yard. They have not found the van or the sickos that tried to get the boys in their van. PLEASE~ BE VERY CAREFUL, KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.. IF ANYTHING LOOKS STRANGE, CALL IT IN!! That post was shared 52 times. Ames , who investigated the case, said they found nothing to indicate the woman intended to take the children. Barry said Story County Sheriff Paul Fitzgerald tells deputies that all reports of missing children and possible abduction attempts are taken very seriously. You will throw everything you have at it, Barry said Fitzgerald has told him. In Iowa, state code sets the requirements for missing persons cases and whether that person can be entered into the . Anyone reported missing must be declared missing if they: Police must file a report and their names must be added to the missing persons clearinghouse. If law enforcement know where the missing person might be, they must also contact law enforcement in that area and let them know about the report. Even if missing persons cases do not meet these requirements there is nothing that says there cant be an investigation, according to the law.",0

Here are some of the details released by Metro Police: Between Dec. 12, 2014, and May 12, 2015, the Metro Transit Police Communications Division received 11 telephone calls via the 911 emergency system reporting bomb threats and/or hostage situations at or directed against Metro stations, trains and buses. In each instance, the caller conveyed specific threat information concerning destructive devices and intended acts of violence. Each report prompted an emergency response by Metro Transit Police and in some cases other law enforcement agencies. The threat information provided in each of the 911 calls turned out to be wholly false, according to the Complaint.Investigators allege that Stone-Coleman made false threats on approximately 11 occasions, each resulting in an emergency response and some resulting in disruptions to transit service. Among the false threats: Metro Transit Police detectives used cellular phone records, digital video surveillance from stations and buses, and telephone audio to identify Stone-Coleman. A warrant for his arrest was issued Tuesday (May 26, 2015). We have no greater responsibility than protecting Metros customers and employees, said Metro Transit Police Chief Ron Pavlik.

1430,"A U.S. Marine Corps non-commissioned officer was convicted Wednesday, June 17 of killing an unarmed civilian in Iraq nine years ago. Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins III of Plymouth, Massachusetts, was also convicted of conspiracy and larceny, but acquitted of preparing a false report about the killing, the Los Angeles Times reported from Camp Pendleton. The six-Marine jury is scheduled to return to court Thursday to consider a sentence. Hutchins faces more than four years behind bars, The Times reported. Hutchins had been convicted of unpremeditated murder in 2007 and sentenced to 15 years behind bars but that was later reduced to an 11-year sentence. A military court in 2007 convicted Hutchins of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, making a false official statement, and larceny. Hutchins conviction was overturned in 2010 because his lawyer was allowed to retire on the eve of trial and again two years ago because his initial confession was deemed to have been illegally obtained. Authorities said Hutchins -- then a squad leader of a unit conducting counter-insurgency operations -- took part in a plan to kidnap and kill suspected insurgent Saleh Gowad near Hamdania in 2006 but grabbed disabled 52-year-old war veteran Hashim Awad instead when Gowads family foiled the plan.

1431,"The trial of a man accused of the kidnapping and murder of 15-year-old Sierra LaMar more than four years ago will remain in Santa Clara County. In a written decision issued today, Superior Court Judge Vanessa Zecher denied without prejudice a request by attorneys for 25-year-old Antolin Garcia-Torres to move the trial outside of the county. The court does not find that there is a reasonable likelihood that the defendant would be unable to receive a fair trial in Santa Clara County, Zecher wrote. Sierra disappeared on March 16, 2012, from unincorporated Morgan Hill where she left home that morning for school but never made it to the bus. Her body hasnt been found despite numerous organized searches in the southern section of the county. The decision comes after three days of testimony last week at the Hall of Justice in San Jose from defense witness Edward Bronson, a California State University, Chico professor emeritus who advised the trial be moved outside the county. Bronson, who has testified on multiple change of venue motions for more than 30 years, made the recommendation based on his research of news coverage and a survey of 300 residents to determine if a prejudice exists among potential jurors. Attorneys from both sides of the case presented their final arguments on the change of venue motion before Zecher during a hearing Tuesday morning. Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Dana Veazey argued that Bronsons testimony was undoubtedly passionate, and pointed out flaws in his research. The large size of the county would allow the court to find jurors who have no or little knowledge of the case, according to Veazey. The fact that Sierra was a child and a daughter would follow the case wherever it went, Veazey said. Brian Matthews of the Santa Clara County Alternate Defender Office asserted that Bronsons research showed the case still had a high prominence within the county four years after Sierra vanished. The 15-year-old girl was considered a universal daughter only within the county and Garcia-Torres would receive a fair trial if it were moved outside the county, Matthews said. The case is widely known throughout the county and has become a reference point in news coverage for other stories, according to Matthews. Garcia-Torres is scheduled to return to the Hall of Justice at 3 p.m. Friday for a hearing on a motion to suppress evidence in the case.

1433,"Image: Wossen Assaye (FCPD) The accused bank robber who allegedly sparked a massive manhunt on March 31 wants his trial moved from Alexandria to Charlottesville, according to media reports. Wossen Assaye is accused of being the bicycle bandit, who robbed around a dozen banks in Northern Virginia and sometimes rode away on two wheels, says the Washington Times and other sources. Hes also charged with trying to escape custody from Inova Fairfax Hospital, triggering a huge police response that involved dozens of officers, helicopters, roadblocks and live coverage on local TV. Over the course of nine hours, Assaye allegedly stole a security officers gun at the hospital and carjacked two vehicles before law enforcement authorities captured him as he got off a Metro bus in Washington, D.C. Now his lawyers want his Aug. 31 trial on charges of escape, kidnapping and bank robbery to be moved from the federal courthouse in Alexandria to Charlottesville, radio station WTOP-FM reported. They argue that the publicity generated by the massive manhunt has tainted the jury pool and will prevent him from getting a fair trial. Federal prosecutors with the U.S. District Court in Alexandria are due to respond next week to the motion for a change of venue, WTOP reported. Assaye has been jailed without bond.",0

1440,"By Bay City News Service: A Marin County jury convicted a Larkspur man Wednesday of robbing banks throughout Marin County in 2012 and 2013. Christopher Jay Wootton, 61, was dubbed the Cotton Ball Bandit because of a knit hat with earflaps and a cotton ball that he wore during some of the heists. He was convicted of 10 bank robberies and an attempted bank robbery, his attorney Michael Coffino said. The jury deliberated over a period of three days. The jury was scheduled to return to court Friday to decide whether Wootton has prior felony convictions for kidnapping and burglary that could increase his sentence. A sentencing date has not been set. Wootton was charged with robbing banks in San Rafael, San Anselmo, Greenbrae, Corte Madera, Tiburon and Novato between Dec. 12, 2012 and Dec. 11, 2013. He also was charged with an attempted bank robbery, commercial burglary, evading police while driving recklessly, possession of a loaded weapon and assaulting police with a weapon. Wooton was arrested on Dec. 11, 2013 after the Novato Bank of the West robbery. A Marin County sheriffs deputy followed his silver Saturn from southbound U.S. Highway 101 into San Rafael where he crashed into a light police near the Northgate Mall.

1441,"Two North Bay men have been arrested following a months-long investigation into a San Francisco womans account of being kidnapped from San Francisco and driven to Sonoma County where she was violently sexually assaulted. Fredi Analberto Lopez-Flores, 33, of Novato, was taken into custody Friday in connection with the April 14 rape and kidnapping and Christian Alejandro Quintero, 24, of Sonoma, was arrested Saturday, a Sonoma County Sheriffs Office spokesman said Monday. This incident began when a San Francisco woman got into what she thought was a ride-sharing car after leaving Brunos Bar in San Francisco, said sheriffs Sgt. Spencer Crum. The suspects took her to Sonoma where she was beaten, choked and sexually assaulted by two men in the car. She eventually escaped and was aided by a Safeway employee. Following more than 2,000 hours of staff time, Crum said detectives have determined Quintero and Lopez-Flores were not drivers for any ride-sharing company. Rather, it was a random attack, Crum said. The suspects found the woman standing on the corner of Stanyan Street and Fulton Street in San Francisco, waiting for a ride on the morning of April 14 when Lopez-Flores drove up next to her, Crum said. She had actually taken a ride share from Brunos Bar in the Mission District to this location accidentally and was waiting for a second ride share to get her home. PREVIOUS: Woman Hails Ride In SF, Found Sexually Assaulted In Sonoma: Cops Detectives allege Quintero got out of the car and forced the victim into the back seat of Lopez-Flores car. There, he violently beat and attacked her all the way to Sonoma, Crum said. Once they got to Quinteros neighborhood, they pulled over in a shopping center across from Safeway where Quintero continued to attack and sexually assault her, Crum said. While this occurred, Lopez-Flores walked to the gas station and bought a condom and then he got into the back seat and sexually assaulted the woman. Evidence in the case was gathered by reviewing countless hours of surveillance video from various businesses and bridge cameras. In watching the video they identified one suspect who was seen at about the time of the crime, entering a gas station across the street from the crime scene in Sonoma, Crum said. In this video he was seen purchasing a condom. Numerous search warrants were also written, Crum said, one key warrant being for the victims cellular phone which provided data telling detectives approximately when she crossed the Golden Gate Bridge. Detectives used that information and wrote a warrant for Golden Gate Bridge District surveillance video which was ultimately supplied. While watching that video, detectives observed a black Dodge Magnum car with a specific blue neon license plate light, Crum said. This Dodge Magnum with the neon light was also captured on video from various business surveillance systems in Sonoma. A flier showing the car with its neon light was put out to local law enforcement agencies. The flier also showed the suspect in the gas station. An officer from the Novato Police Department recognized the suspect and distinctive vehicle from a recent unrelated arrest where he towed the suspects car, Crum said. With that suspect identified as Lopez-Flores, Sonoma County detectives wrote a warrant for Lope-Flores cellphone records. These records indicated that Lopez-Flores was in San Francisco on the morning of April 14, 2018 and in the area where the victim was forced into the car and drove north across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sonoma at the same time the victim came to Sonoma, Crum said. Detectives used probable cause to obtain a $2 million warrant for Lopez-Flores arrest. He was taken into custody Friday in San Rafael where he works doing general labor, Crum said. Detectives also determined that the morning of April 14, Lopez-Flores was with his friend, Quintero, who lives about a block away from where the alleged violent attack happened, Crum said. A search warrant was served at Quinteros home, where physical evidence of the crime was allegedly located. Quintero was arrested Saturday at his workplace in Sonoma. Both men were booked into the Sonoma County Jail on suspicion of numerous sex crimes and assault charges. Lopez-Flores is being held on $2 million bail, while Quintero is being held without bail due to an alleged attempted murder charge associated with the case, Crum said. This investigation was very extensive and involved over 2,000 hours of staff time and approximately 20 search warrants written and issued, Crum said. The investigation took detectives to nine different counties and required cooperation from numerous agencies and private businesses. We wish to thank everyone who helped solve this crime.

1448,"Federal authorities descended upon Beaumont in the early morning hours of Friday, as they executed warrants at various Southland locations in what was described as a long-term criminal probe, Patch has learned. Arrested was a local man who was named as one of the leaders of the Vagos Outlaw Motorcycle Gang, accused in numerous violent crimes including racketeering, murder, robbery, kidnapping and aggravated assault, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. A 45-page federal indictment was unsealed Friday afternoon after multiple agencies across California, Nevada and Hawaii served search and arrest warrants related to the alleged criminal activities of the Vagos gang. In total, 22 people were arrested, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Though 23 people were named in the indictment, officials say that one of the suspects died within the last few weeks. A cause of death was not provided. Warrants related to this case were also served in Las Vegas, Reno, Pasadena, Moreno Valley, Fontana, Hollister, San Jose, Granada Hills, Alhambra, Canyon Country and Oahu, Hawaii. Among those arrested locally was Beaumont resident Pastor Fausto Palafox – who goes by the name Ta Ta, according to federal officials. Palofox, 53, worked as a leader for the gang, the indictment alleges. Among other things, the indictment says that Palofox and 11 other alleged leaders were responsible for: These arrests and indictments are the culmination of a far-reaching, meticulous, long-term probe involving HSI and multiple other law enforcement agencies aimed at dealing a crippling blow to one of this countrys most ruthless and violent criminal gangs, said Acting Executive Associate Director Derek N. Benner for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcements Homeland Security Investigations. Members of this organization wrongly believed themselves to be above the law and immune from justice, but as todays enforcement actions make abundantly clear, they should not have underestimated our collective resolve, he added. The 12-count superseding indictment paints a picture of the gang as a multinational organization operating in seven countries on four different continents. Prosecutors say they have nearly 75 chapters in the United States alone. The indictment describes them like an organized crime family with a hierarchy where the goal of members to enrich the gang and victims are intimidated through violence and threats. According to the allegations in the indictment, witnesses to the gangs criminal acts are typically victims of acts of obstruction, intimidation and harassment who are too afraid to approach law enforcement or testify in court proceedings, a news release from the DOJ said Friday.

Of Justice by BanningBeaumontPatch on Scribd Around 5 a.m. Friday, witnesses to the Beaumont raid say they spotted several agents in the area of Edgar Avenue and East 12th Street. Special agents and tactical personnel with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) and officers from a number of other state and local agencies executed federal search and arrest warrants at multiple locations throughout the Los Angeles area and in other jurisdictions this morning in conjunction with a long-term criminal probe, Department of Homeland Security Spokeswoman Lori Haley told Patch via email. Beaumont Resident TJ Smith says that after hearing a loud banging noise around 5 a.m., he saw lots of unmarked cars and what he described as a bigger SWAT vehicle off of Edgar Avenue. I was outside maybe 30 seconds after the bang and they had already had 3-4 people on the curb, he said. Another was being pushed down the driveway into the back of an SUV. Its a significant investigation, Haley added. Beaumont Police say they assisted Friday morning, providing their assistance with the use of K-9 Mila. The U.S. Department of Justice identified the following 22 people in connection to the case: Officials say Thomas Granville Garretson, aka Tommy Guns, died before he could be arrested. -- Image credit: TJ Smith",1
1449,"Dont waste the Puyallup police departments time, or theyll charge you with a crime. Thats what happened this week when a father called police to report that his son had been abducted by his drug-addict mom. The incident nearly triggered an Amber Alert before police figured out the dad had fabricated the story. The father, who was working construction in Puyallup, called police to report that his truck had been stolen with his son inside. The father had apparently left the 7-year-old in the truck for about two hours while he went to work. He told police his estranged wife was likely the culprit. But while the father was talking to police, the mother called the father, and police were able to ascertain that the mother and son were just shopping at the Best Buy along South Meridian. It turns out that the Best Buy shopping trip was planned, and the father knew about it. Police are pursuing charges of false reporting against the father. One thing did turn out to be true: police found the mother in possession of drugs, and she was arrested. Just an absolute complete cluster that wasted so many resources and time, Puyallup police said in a report about the incident. Image via Shutterstock",0

1451,"A mall shooting at a busy Oregon mall Tuesday brought many in the South Sound back to Nov. 20, 2005. Thats when the region experienced its own terrifying case of a gunman opening fire inside a crowded mall. Dominick S. Maldonado, who was 20 at the time, began walking through the Tacoma Mall and pulling the trigger. People ran screaming away from the mall or were hiding terrified inside of it. Maldonaldo took four people hostage. He left one man paralyzed. Maldonaldo eventually surrendered and was sentenced to 163 years in prison. Tuesdays shooting at the Clackamas Mall in Oregon had some eerie similarities. Police say the shooter was Jacob Tyler Roberts, who was 22, just two years older than Maldonaldo. Donning a white mask, he opened fire in one of the Portland areas busiest malls, just like the Tacoma Mall during the holiday shopping season. At this point, police believe he acted alone and had no clear motive, the same manner in which Maldonaldo carried out his act. But one glaring difference: Roberts turned the gun on himself while Maldonaldo is still alive. It seems like these shootings are becoming more common than not. We ask you, Patch users, what do you think? Did Tuesdays mall shooting in Oregon remind you of the Tacoma Mall shooting in 2005? Is there anything authorities can do to help prevent these types of tragedies? Tell us in the comments below.",0

1453,"A taxi driver taken hostage by the three inmates who recently escaped from the Orange County Jail described in remarks published today how his drunken captors argued about his fate, climaxing in a drag-out fight between two of them at a motel in San Jose. Taxi driver Long Ma told The Orange County Register he was resigned to die at the hands of his kidnappers. Ma, who speaks only Vietnamese, couldnt understand what the men were saying. But he figured it was about him. And it wasnt good, the paper reported. In the beginning I was very scared, but by that time I had said, If I die Im going to be happy, not sad, because thats no way to live, Ma, a 74- year-old independent taxi driver from Garden Grove, said through an interpreter.If God calls you, you answer. The escapees held Ma captive for seven days starting the evening of Jan. 22, moving him from one motel to the next. Ma said the fugitives hijacked him at gunpoint and used him to cash checks and sign motel registrations. They toyed over and over with killing him, at one point buying rope and marching him to the end of the Santa Cruz Wharf, according to the Register. When one of the escapees stuck a gun against Mas belly after the hijacking, I was in a panic, he said. I said, Help me, Ill do whatever you say, Ma recalled. He sad his captors spent each night knocking back bottles of Jack Daniels and 12-packs of beer. They began each bleary morning the same way: watching the Orange County Sheriffs Departments news conferences on television and proudly pointing to their pictures. They werent afraid, Ma said. They were gloating, Ma told the newspaper. After the group settled in midweek at the Alameda Motel in San Jose, the nightly arguments between Bac Duong and Hossein Nayeri grew more heated and finally erupted into a fistfight. Ma said he watched in fear as Nayeri wrestled Duong to the ground and then pummeled his face, appearing to break his nose. Thats when Duong began whispering to Ma about escaping together. They got their chance Thursday night when Nayeri and Jonathan Tieu, the third escapee, left to get the windows tinted on a white van the trio had stolen. The two returned to Southern California in Mas leased Honda, which he uses as a taxi. Duong surrendered and Ma was released. Related: City News Service",1
1454,"- A police officer in Marietta is receiving high marks for championing a community-based youth program that trains children to be safe and aware of their surroundings. The RadKIDS program gives children the tools they need to contend with a number of problems affecting them today: abductions, bullying and internet safety, to name a few. While RadKIDS headquarters are located in South Dennis, Massachusetts, their initiatives, such as the Ride Along program, have been instituted across the country, including in Marietta. The police department has participated in the program since 2001, but recent efforts by a local officer have re-energized the citys commitment. The Marietta Police Department singled out Officer Paul Hill along with local personal injury lawyer Gary Martin Hays for their efforts in trying to make RadKIDS a priority in the citys schools. Officer Hill has been aggressively promoting the radKIDS® program within our city schools. He set a goal of teaching this program to every child inside the Citys school system, Marietta police said in a news release. Martin and his wife started the nonprofit organization Keep Georgia Safe in 2008 to provide safety education and crime prevention training for families. Hill had a goal of implementing the RadKIDS program in schools by training physical education teachers. But there was one problem. He needed funds to turn the dream into a reality. Hill turned to the community after researching what it would cost to teach every elementary school child the safety techniques of the RadKIDS program. Hays, in conjunction with Keep Georgia Safe, quickly agreed to donate the full amount needed to fund the program for the Marietta City Schools, the police said in the news release. His generous donation will ensure all employees are certified and able to teach at their respective school. We expect certification of the teachers to take place this summer and implementation of the program into the curriculum in the fall of 2017. With efforts like these, Hays and Officer Hill are doing what they can to make 2017 a great year for children in Marietta. Image via Pixabay",0

1456,"A now 39-year-old Fountain Valley man who was involved in the kidnapping, torture and sexually mutilation of a Newport Beach marijuana dispensary owner was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life in prison without the possibility of parole, officials said. An Orange County Superior Court judge also tacked on two consecutive terms of seven years to life for Kyle Shirakawa Handley, who was convicted in January. Handley was one of three prison escapees who fled the Orange County Jail then aired video of their escape. Handley was found guilty of helping to kidnap the pair from a Newport home and drive them out to the desert. One of the victims was brutally beaten in an effort to get his money, according to Newport Beach Police Lt. Jon Lewis. All four defendants were charged with two felony counts of kidnapping for ransom and one felony count each of aggravated mayhem, torture, and first degree residential burglary, with a sentencing enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury, according to the D.A.s office. The victim, whose penis was slashed off by his attackers, described in a statement how the torture has left permanent physical and emotional scars.Due to the horrific nature of Kyle Handleys crime, my family and I have serious physical security concerns, he said in the statement read to the court by Senior Deputy District Attorney Heather Brown.I live with the feeling of always looking over my shoulder, never feeling safe in any one location for any period of time, and fearing for the safety the people I care about, he said. This is a constant and ongoing anxiety. The victim said he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and has ongoing issues with socializing and trusting people, being in crowds and sleeping. My family was emotionally distraught seeing that I was nearly tortured to death, and they themselves share in many of the anxieties and PTSD that plague me today. He said doctors have told him that he will have issues for the rest of my life. The damage to my genital area has not only been physically painful but has caused ongoing mental distress and is a near constant reminder of what happened to me, he said. I fear that I will never have the feeling or sense of being comfortable and carefree anywhere ever again. Handleys attorney, Robert Weinberg, advocated for a life sentence with the possibility of parole. But Prickett rejected that appeal, noting that the defendant, who was the driver of the van used to kidnap the victim under one legal theory, could have pulled over and jumped out and run away. And if Handley was not behind the wheel, then he would have been actively participating in the torturing of the victim, who the kidnappers mistakenly believed had buried a great deal of cash in the desert, the judge said. After dumping (the victim) outside the van, the abductors poured bleach on his open wounds, Pickett said. That act was done possibly to erase DNA evidence, but also could have been done to further punish the victim, he said. Weinberg argued that prosecutors did not prove what specific acts Handley might have done in the torturing of the victim. But the judge noted that the victims abductors blindfolded him with military precision, so quickly that an identification of the participants in the attack was not possible. Handley befriended the dispensary owner and saw the victim spending a great deal of cash while on a trip to Las Vegas, where they stayed in an expensive suite, according to Murphy. Months later, on Oct. 2, 2012, the dispensary owner and his female landlord were abducted from their Newport Beach home about 2:30 a.m. and taken to the Mojave Desert.The prosecutor said the abductors believed the dispensary owner had buried $1 million in the desert, since banks do not accept proceeds from marijuana sales. When they realized there was no buried money, they cut off the mans penis and threw it out the window of the van they used to flee the scene, Murphy said. The kidnappers left the woman a knife so she could cut zip-ties they had used to bind her feet. She was then able to walk to a highway, where a Kern County sheriffs deputy spotted her, Murphy said. A key witness in the trial was Cortney Shegerian, the ex-wife of co- defendant Hossein Nayeri, 39, who was one of three Orange County Jail inmates who escaped from custody in 2016 and sparked a statewide manhunt.Shegerian cut a deal with prosecutors and helped investigators lure Nayeri out of Iran, where he fled following the dispensary owners abduction and mutilation, Murphy said. Shegerian testified that she heard Handley laughing and playing with a blow torch, one of the tools used to torture the man, two weeks before the victim and his landlord were abducted. Investigators found a zip-tie in Handleys home that contained DNA of another co-defendant, Ryan Anthony Kevorkian, 39, and a blue latex glove found at Handleys home had DNA on it matching Nayeris, prosecutors allege. Nayeri and Kevorkian are still awaiting trial.On Sept. 26, 2012, Nayeri led police on a chase in Newport Beach and got away, but police recovered his vehicle, which had surveillance cameras and GPS trackers in it, Brown said. Videos found in the Chevrolet Tahoe -- which belonged to Handley -- showed hours of surveillance of the residence where the dispensary owner lived with the abducted woman and her boyfriend, the prosecutor said. A break came in the case came when Shegerian went to claim Handleys Chevrolet Tahoe from the Newport Beach impound yard, she said.

1458,"By Bay City News Service: A Marin County jury convicted a Larkspur man Wednesday of robbing banks throughout Marin County in 2012 and 2013. Christopher Jay Wootton, 61, was dubbed the Cotton Ball Bandit because of a knit hat with earflaps and a cotton ball that he wore during some of the heists. He was convicted of 10 bank robberies and an attempted bank robbery, his attorney Michael Coffino said. The jury deliberated over a period of three days. The jury was scheduled to return to court Friday to decide whether Wootton has prior felony convictions for kidnapping and burglary that could increase his sentence. A sentencing date has not been set. Wootton was charged with robbing banks in San Rafael, San Anselmo, Greenbrae, Corte Madera, Tiburon and Novato between Dec. 12, 2012 and Dec. 11, 2013. He also was charged with an attempted bank robbery, commercial burglary, evading police while driving recklessly, possession of a loaded weapon and assaulting police with a weapon. Wooton was arrested on Dec. 11, 2013 after the Novato Bank of the West robbery. A Marin County sheriffs deputy followed his silver Saturn from southbound U.S. Highway 101 into San Rafael where he crashed into a light police near the Northgate Mall. When Wootton got out of the car with a gun in his hand he was shot by Deputy Donald Carpenter. Wootton was hospitalized until Dec. 17 and booked in the Marin County Jail. The Marin County District Attorneys Office filed 16 charges against him.",0
1459,"The recent arrest of an Austin woman for allegedly assaulting an officer has yielded dual focus on how police interact with the mentally ill and the protocol involved when arresting an undocumented immigrant in a city that touts its empathetic stance toward migrants. Tania Silva, 21, was arrested by police last Thursday, July 19, by police in what began as a welfare check requested by family members describing her to be in the throes of a mental health crisis — calls that followed a missing person report for the same woman, Officer Destiny Winston said during a Tuesday press conference. Upon arriving at 3103 Edgedale just before 7:30 a.m., police found the woman clutching a small dog. According to police, Silva expressed desires to harm herself. Her actions prompted officers to attempt to secure a hospital stay for the woman as they continued to negotiate with her to cooperate, the police spokeswoman said. Winston added that a mental health officer was dispatched to the scene to better handle the situation given the womans mental state. He did his due diligence and called nearby hospitals to locate a bed for Silva so she could get the help that she needed, Winston said. Yet despite her mental state — and a known history of mental episodes familiar to police — the decision was made to handcuff the woman. Winston said the decision was based on Silvas allegedly aggressive behavior, her past episodes and an aversion to men. Knowing this, Winston said a female backup officer also was dispatched to the scene. After explaining shed need to relinquish the dog, officers then made the decision to handcuff the woman, Winston said. Based off of Silvas prior aggressive behavior described by callers, Winston said, officers made the decision to take her into custody ...for the safety of not only herself, but others as well in order to transport her to the hospital, again so that she could get some help. Thats when the situation broke down. As police reached for the dog to return it to its owner, Winston said the woman became aggressive towards the officers. So when officers attempted to remove the dog and get Silva into handcuffs, she became agitated, Winston told reporters. A physical disturbance ensued before Silva dropped to her knees, Winston said, at which time the small dog she had been holding was retrieved. After being handcuffed, Silva allegedly twice landed kicks to one officers midsection before scratching him, ...causing him pain, Winston said. Despite relatives later assertions that police previously had transported Silva to the hospital without incident during mental episodes, shes now charged with assault on a public servant — a second-degree felony. And in an age of heightened deportations — urged on both by the Trump administration and Gov. Greg Abbott whose stance on immigration has proved intractable — Silva may also be deported. While Silva languishes at the Travis County Jail, the Immigration and Customs Enforcment (ICE) has placed a detainer on her — a hold of up to 48 hours preventing her release — to allow an agent sufficient time for travel (usually from the San Antonio field office) to fetch her and proceed with deportation proceedings. The case has galvanized immigrant advocates who gathered outside the Travis County Correctional Complex on Tuesday demanding her release. Among them were Silva family members, including her sister, Pamela, and father, Rosendo Segovia. Concurrently, a petition calling for her release has been circulated. We are here to demand justice for a young woman who is in crisis, a Workers Defense Project member said at the spontaneous rally. Tania struggles with mental illness and was arrested when her family called 911 for assistance. Now Tania faces an ICE hold, and we cannot get her into hospital care unless the ICE hold is dropped. Silvas sister described her sibling as a good person who despite her mental illness contributed to her community by tutoring children and advocating for animals. Silvas father also vouched for his daughters personal attributes: Tania is a very sensitive, strong and capable young woman, he said in Spanish, adding she is is studying to be a veterinarian at the Alamo Community Colleges. But she didnt return from school last Wednesday, prompting family members to call police. The following day, police were called for assistance once she was located. The police who normally have helped us transport her to the hospital in many occasions when she gets sick, the father continued This time they escalated the situation with little attention to a person who suffers from mental illness, and took her to jail where they filed charges instead of taking her to the hospital as we asked because thats what we usually do. Segovia said his daughter has been in jail for nearly a week without taking her needed medications. He wondered if police were equipped to recognize that his daughter required hospitalization. She is sick, and needs help, Segovia said. She is not bleeding. Perhaps the police needed to see her bleeding and injured physically to understand she needed medical attention, but her brain is deteriorating and we fear the damage from her jail stay might be irreversible. Winston painted a slightly different story, saying officers tried many times to deescalate the situation before one of the officers was physically assaulted: To be clear, officers tried several deescalation techniques, Winston said. They explained to Silva over and over that they were there to help her, even before they got on scene attempted to have a female officer present because they had the prior knowledge that Silva was aggressive toward males. So they tried to explain, they tried to make her comfortable. The ultimate goal was to get Silva the help that she needed, and thats why the officers were there. Unfortunately, it did turn into a violent incident where an arrest had to be made. Deescalation has become something of a buzz term for the APD, particularly in the wake of several high-profile incident of what many critics have viewed as police overreach in dealing with mentally ill suspects. After recently being named permanent police chief after serving in an interim role for 16 months, top cop Brian Manley vowed to community members he would instruct his rank and file to exhaust all other deescalation techniques when confronting suspects before force is used. Focus on deescalation comes after people later deemed to have been suffering mental issues were shot by police during confrontations: The new focus on police deescalation appears to be taking hold of late. This past Sunday, police declined to press charges on a man barricaded in his car while threatening to harm himself who held police at bay for several hours. Rather than arrest the man, police said they opted to take him to the hospital for evaluation after the early Sunday episode at 11901 Hobby Horse Court, not far from the upscale Domain Northside mixed-use development. Typically, Austin police send out the whole SWAT arsenal — armored vehicles, robots, hostage negotiators and the like — in dealing with barricaded suspects, while an officer on a megaphone shouts commands to surrender toward eventual arrest of suspects. But this past Sunday, the tactics used on the barricaded man were decidedly subdued and prolonged toward a peaceful resolution. Yet police declined to identify the race and age of that detainee, citing medical privacy provisions outlined under provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, legislation that provides data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding medical information. The mans hospitalization rather than arrest gave him the cover of privacy, as an officer speaking to reporters after the the incident suggested. Whether that man is Anglo is conjecture given the HIPAA shield yielded by his hospitalization, and that statistical datum may never be known given the privacy provision to include it in the mix in assessing potential police profiling. Silva, on the other hand, is Hispanic with questionable documentation status, and her arrest comes amid a crackdown on undocumented immigrants living in the city — enforced action stridently endorsed by Gov. Greg Abbott whose efforts have led to a ban on so-called sanctuary cities more hospitable to immigrants. Last years passage of Senate Bill 4 — legislation championed by Abbott — gave police greater leeway in asking about immigration status during even the most benign encounters with residents amid a broader anti-immigrant sentiment at the federal level. The legislation calls for greater cooperation with ICE in reporting undocumented residents, with penalties included for law enforcement officials deemed uncooperative that include possible jail time. Whether the tactics of SB4 and/or the current anti-immigrant climate fueled by the Trump administration thats taken hold nationwide played a role in Silvas arrest also is the subject of conjecture. The official line is she was aggressive toward officers as they tried to take away the dog she was holding to detain her. But some critics wonder if profiling played a role this time, particularly given previous police assistance in helping Silvas family with her hospitalization. Critics also question the use of handcuffs on a woman known to be mentally ill. In her press conference, Winston cited Austin Police Department policy dictating any person transported in a police vehicle must have the restraints. But she did note some exceptions: Those of advanced age, physically injured detainees or those with a disability that prevents the handcuffs placed behind their back, in which case they are handcuffed at the front or secured with flex cuffs, Winston explained. Yet its unclear from Winstons narrative if the officers involved had the proper training in dealing with the mentally ill. Lacking such training — particularly via Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) programs that have gained in popularity among law enforcement agencies nationwide — can lead to quick escalations when dealing with the mentally ill, according to the PowerDMS blog. Studies show that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed by police than other suspects, according to the blog. Furthermore, the Washington Post reports that one-quarter of police shootings in 2015 involved people in the throes of emotional or mental crisis. In most of these cases the individual in question was armed, but police officers werent responding to reports of a crime, according to the Post. More often, the police officers were called by relatives, neighbors or other bystanders worried that a mentally fragile person was behaving erratically, the Post reported. More than 50 people were explicitly suicidal. Silva was not armed when she was arrested, but holding a small dog. While local law enforcement and federal agents mull over what to do with Silva, her family simply wants her out of jail and in a medical setting. During the rally outside the jail, her father pleaded with ICE to remove the detainer that would enable her hospitalization and called for empathetic residents for support. We are desperate, Segovia said. We ask for relief from Austin police officials to have her urgently transport her to the hospital so she can get the medical treatment she needs. He also called for ICE to release their detainer in order for that medical treatment to be sought. Please, I offer my plea to this city. The empathy you have demonstrated I very much appreciate. I ask for the solidarity from the good citizens of Austin who are always characterized by their love of the people so that this time my daughter might be be tended to at the hospital she urgently needs.

1461,"Attorneys representing a man being investigated for faking the kidnapping and ransom of Denise Huskins, his 30-year-old girlfriend, held a news conference this afternoon to say the crime is not a hoax. Daniel Russo and Amy Morton, attorneys for Aaron Quinn, said their client was drugged and bound during the abduction, which took place between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. Monday morning. Quinn has fully cooperated with the police investigation, according to his lawyers. What has been coming out makes him look like hes somehow perpetrating a hoax and I want to make it clear to everyone that we have not seen evidence yet that this was some kind of hoax, Russo said. As to the victim and her failure to cooperate with police, we dont know what thats motivated by, Russo said. And its unfair to speculate. Russo said he understands that there are significant pressures on the Vallejo Police Department and the FBI, but there seems to be a stream of blatant lies coming out about our client, about the victim and about whats going on. God help us, but we want to rely on the FBI and the Vallejo Police Department to solve this crime, Russo said. Wednesday night Vallejo police said that Huskins and Quinn had wasted the time and resources of the department, and that the two Vallejo residents owed police and the FBI an apology for sending them on a wild goose chase. We have had over 40 police detectives at the local, state and federal levels, and over 100 support personnel assisting the investigation, working around the clock to help locate Ms. Hoskins, Lt. Kenny Park said. The fact that weve wasted all these resources is really upsetting, he said, adding that, Mr. Quinn and Ms. Huskins owe this community an apology. Quinn contacted police on Monday around 2 p.m. to report that Huskins, 30, had been abducted by strangers from their home in the 500 block of Kirkland Avenue on Mare Island in the early morning hours that day, and that he had since received a ransom demand for $8,500. The report triggered a massive search of Mare Island, but Park said police found the story incredible and hard to believe from the beginning. We could not substantiate any of it, Park said. Wednesday morning police in Southern California announced via Twitter that Huskins had been found safe at a relatives home in Huntington Beach. Officials arranged a jet to fly her to Northern California, but they were unable to locate her, Park said Wednesday night. Police now understand Huskins has retained a lawyer. Park added that theyll refer the case for state or federal charges if sufficient information can be gathered. --Bay City News Also on Patch:",0

Shes not back in her home yet, so I guess that gives you some indication to how shes feeling. Your sense of security is violated, Ripken told ABCs Good Morning America Friday morning. Ripken told Good Morning America he didnt find out his mother was missing until 9 p.m. that evening. Violet Ripken was taken from her home early July 24. She was doing her normal days activities and was met in her garage at gunpoint, Ripken said. The elder Ripken was then tied up and driven around in a car for about 23 hours. Who knows what actually happened in the car for that period of time, mom tries to articulate it but really it was just her trying to stay calm and hope and believe that she was going to be returned, Ripken said in the interview. Ripken told Good Morning America his mothers kidnapping was premeditated, but its unclear if it had anything to do with the familys fame. It could be a random act or it could be one that was deeper than that, Ripken told show hosts. Violet Ripken, 74, was taken from her home by a man hiding in her garage between 7 and 8 a.m. on July 24, and returned unharmed to her neighborhood, where she was found tied up in her car around 6:15 a.m. on July 25, police said.

1465,"Update, Dec. 9: Investigators have determined the suspicious items found in the SUV that crashed Saturday at the Edmonds waterfront were not explosives. Detectives from the bomb squad examined the device and determined that it was not an explosive, although it was designed to look very much like an actual pipe bomb, Detective Mark Jamieson of the Seattle Police Department wrote in a news release. --- Update, 2:30 p.m.: A bank robbery suspect is in custody after leading police on a chase through Shoreline and crashing an SUV on the Edmonds waterfront. Assistant Chief Paul McDonagh of the Seattle Police Department said the incident began at around 11 a.m. Saturday when a man in his 30s robbed a bank in the 13200 block of Aurora Avenue North in Seattle. The suspect fled the bank and then confronted a man in a pickup truck, carjacking the vehicle with the occupant still inside. He traveled into Shoreline, dropping the man and the truck off near North 143rd Street and Meridian and getting into a gold Ford Explorer. The vehicle was spotted by a Shoreline police officer, and the King County Sheriffs Office began a pursuit, with the assistance of Shoreline Police and Edmonds Police. The suspect crashed the SUV while attempting to make a turn in the 301 block of Admiral Way. The vehicle landed on its side, and the suspect was able to crawl out through the sunroof. He was immediately taken into police custody and did not appear to have any serious injuries, McDonagh said. A bomb squad was called to the scene because the man told employees at the bank that he had explosives, and police spotted some unknown suspicious items in the Explorer, McDonagh said. Bomb squad detectives from the King County Sheriffs Office and Seattle Police Department are still processing the scene. At this point, its not clear whether the suspect used any sort of weapon or if the suspicious items are in fact explosives. McDonagh said no one was injured in the bank robbery or police pursuit, although the pickup truck driver was emotionally shaken. Obviously its a very frightening situation, he said. The crash caused some minor property damage to the marina, McDonagh said. Check back with Patch for more updates as the investigation continues. --- Original post: A man who robbed a bank in Seattle has crashed his car near the Edmonds ferry terminal, according to Sgt. Cindi West of the King County Sheriffs Office. A bomb squad is en route to the scene because the suspect apparently claimed to have explosives.

1466,"A parolee who allegedly abducted an acquaintance and forced him to perform sex acts at gunpoint in a Carlsbad motel room is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday at the Vista Courthouse. Anthony Henderson, also known as Antoine Demond Henderson, was arrested last Thursday after the midday attack. The 22-year-old alleged victim made a 911 call shortly before 11 a.m. to report the purported crimes, telling a dispatcher he had managed to escape the lodge in the 700 block of Macadamia Drive when the assailant stepped out, according to police. About 40 minutes later, a patrol sergeant spotted a man matching the description of the alleged assailant in a car heading south on Interstate 5, near Birmingham Drive, Lt. Chris Boyd said. Officers pulled over the vehicle and arrested one of its three occupants, identified as Henderson, of Chula Vista. Henderson, 44, was booked into county jail in Vista on suspicion of kidnapping, forced oral copulation and violation of parole. The nature of the prior relationship between the alleged victim, an Escondido resident, and Henderson was unclear, and police were unsure if the people with the suspect at the time of his arrest might face charges in the case. - City News Service / Image via Shutterstock",1

1468,"Royal Oak police said a Saturday morning report that a man had barricaded himself inside a house and taken two hostages at a house in the 1100 block of royal was actually an instance of swatting, a hoax that has been sweeping the country. Royal Oak police and the Southeast Oakland County SWAT team responded to the residence about 11:04 a.m. after receiving a 911 call in which an unknown suspect claimed he had stabbed two females at the residence and was armed with a shotgun, according to a police statement. Police established a perimeter and advised neighbors to remain in their homes. The annual Mind Over Matter 5K run/walk was diverted to ensure the safety of the race participants. After about an hour officers began to realize this may be a swatting call, which is a term commonly used to describe a false report causing a significant police response, Royal Oak police said in a news release. Related: During the incident, police made contact with a man inside the house, who was working at his computer in the basement and was unaware of the heavy police presence outside his residence. After interviewing him, police realized they had been punked. False reports of this nature create a very dangerous situation for responding emergency services and the community, police said in the statement. The person who called in this fake report committed a felony, which carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. In a similar hoax last year, police in West Bloomfield dispatched a special operations team after receiving a call from a man who claimed he had shot his wife with an AK-47, planted explosives throughout the condo, and taken a neighbor hostage and killed him. Also last year, Oakland County sheriffs deputies responded to a residence in Independence Township after getting a call that a man with a machine gun had taken hostages. The FBI says swatting has resulted in some close calls, including the injury of a police officer en route to a hoax. Also, the FBI said, some victims have suffered mild heart attacks when SWAT teams show up at their doors. The hoaxes are usually the work of a computer hacker whos able to make it seem a call came from a specific address.",0

1470,"The new countywide Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system has resulted in its first two arrests, Mercer County Prosecutor Angelo J. Onofri and Hopewell Township Police Chief Lance Maloney said on Thursday. A Hopewell Police officer equipped with an automated license plate reader stopped a 2014 Ford F450 truck in the area of Route 31 near North Main Street at about 2:25 a.m. on March 20 after the reader identified the truck as having been stolen out of Houston, Texas. The driver, identified as 23-year-old Ernesto Herrera-Lesteiro and passenger, 27-year-old Yonder Diaz-Sanchez were taken into custody. Both were Cuban Nationals with a listed address of Paterson, NJ. Police said they recovered credit cards that werent in either mans name. Further investigation revealed that the cards had been stolen during a robbery in Perryville, Maryland on March 17. Working with Maryland State Police, investigators linked Herrera-Lesteiro and Diaz-Sanchez to the kidnapping and armed robbery of a truck driver. They were charged with receiving stolen property and possession of marijuana. Maryland State Police filed extradition warrants on charges of kidnapping, carjacking, theft and assault with a knife. Both men have been lodged without bail in the Mercer County Correction Center. ALPR systems are being adopted nationwide to assist police with enforcement and investigation, Onofri said. They automatically capture an image of a vehicles license plate, transform that image into alphanumeric characters, compare the plate number to vehicles of interest in one or more databases and alert the officer when a vehicle of interest has been identified. The whole process takes a matter of seconds, Onofri said. A total of 25 local and county police departments have been equipped with the system since last summer.The images of Ernesto Herrera-Lesteiro and Yonder Diaz-Sanchez were provided by the Mercer County Prosecutors Office.",1

1473,"A judge has sentenced Adrian Beaton to 35 years in jail for murder, kidnapping, first-degree burglary and assault and battery with intent to kill for a brutal 2010 Mount Pleasant home invasion and homicide. Beaton, 22, of North Charleston, pleaded guilty this week for his part in the crime. Authorities allege he and two accomplices broke into Jose Contrerras apartment in March 2010 and then initiated a burglary that eventually left one man dead and two others injured. Contrerras was bound, pistol-whipped and stunned from a Taser gun, laying on the floor in his apartment, when two friends showed up at his apartment to take him to run errands. His friends, Oscar Girdon and his wife Leticia Herrara, surprised the intruders and authorities allege Beaton fatally shot Girdon twice, and then shot Herrara in the chest. She survived, he did not. All three suspects fled the scene. Area schools were put on lockdown as the police searched for the assailants vehicle. Prosecutors praised Mount Pleasant police for collecting solid evidence that led to the arrest and guilty plea. Meticulous crime scene analysis led to a DNA match to Beaton from swabs taken from the cords used to bind Contrerras, said Prosecutor Jennifer Kneece Shealy. The DNA led to Beatons arrest and eventual conviction. Beaton has two previous burglary charges. He was sentenced Thursday by Circuit Court Judge Thomas Hughston. The Mount Pleasant Police Department should be commended for their thorough investigative efforts and excellent police work involved in bringing Adrian Beaton to justice, said Ninth Circuit Solicitor Scarlett Wilson. Police also arrested James Gerald Pinckney Jr., 28, and Terrell R. Montgomery, 33, for their roles in the home invasion. Their cases are still pending.",1
1474,"By pleading guilty to three murders at a hearing Friday morning, a 20-year-old Indiana man has avoided a possible death penalty sentence. Johnathan Cruz, now 20, admitted to killing three men at random during a four-day crime spree last year. Prosecutors said he was inspired by the 2013 horror movie The Purge, about an authoritarian dystopia with an annual night of violence with impunity. Billy Boyd, 54, Jay Higginbotham, 40, and Jose Alberto Ruiz, 44, were shot and killed by Cruz on May 12 and May 15, 2016. Cruz was arrested on May 16 for a separate crime, illegally imprisoning a girl in a Wendys restaurant, as well as in her home and car. He was charged with kidnapping, criminal confinement, intimidation and battery for that incident and soon implicated in the string of murders. Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry, who has said Cruz killed the three men for sport, Friday described the murders as brazen and random. He said there was no indication Cruz had intending to end his violent crime spree. On the contrary, he was pretty much bragging about it based on statements to witnesses and what was found on his cellphone, he said, according to the AP. Cruz sent messages about the murders to his friends and mother during his spree, court documents said. He sent texts to a girlfriend telling her to watch da videos of me shooting people, on Facebook. I Purge every night now. Since im dieing someone else Has to. Alot of people f-- dat, he wrote, according to court documents. When his mother asked what he was doing, Cruz sent her a link to news coverage of one of the murders. Another witness told detectives Cruz said he was purging, apparently in reference to the movie. Delete those after u read it, he wrote. Do u know they can still pull up deleted history, responded his mother. Yep Ima get a new phone soon say mine was stolen, he wrote back. After an initial court appearance, Cruzs girlfriend, Angela Barger, defended him. Hes not evil...Hes fun. Not violent, she said, according to WRTV. Homicide detectives found dozens of videos and photos of Cruz posing with gang signs and showing off guns, drugs and cash, the Indianapolis Star reported. He posted many such photos on Facebook, although after his arrest he asked a friend to switch everything around, change my profile picture to me and my kid and run his page while he was incarcerated, detectives testified. Cruz accepted a plea agreement and will receive three life sentences to be served consecutively without parole at an official sentencing on May 11, according to Marion County court records reviewed by the AP. Two other defendants still face charges related to their alleged involvement in parts of the crime spree. Alleged getaway driver Elijiah Brooks is accused of participating in the murders of Boyd and Higginbotham. He has been charged with two counts of murder. Steven Clark (also known as Rayvaugh Wood) has been charged with armed robbery and is accused of being involved in Cruzs crimes on May 14, 2016. » Read more: Complete charges against Johnathan Cruz (pdf) SIGN UP: For more news and alerts from the new Indianapolis Patch, subscribe for real-time alerts on breaking stories.

1475,"Opening statements began in a San Jose courtroom Monday in the long-awaited trial of a man charged with murdering Sierra LaMar, a 15-year-old girl from rural Morgan Hill who has not been seen or heard from since March 16, 2012. Antolin Garcia-Torres, now 25, has also been charged with attempting to kidnap three women in separate incidents in Morgan Hill in March 2009. He pleaded not guilty to all four charges. Sierra LaMar is dead, and this man killed her, prosecutor David Boyd began, pointing to Garcia-Torres, who looked calm and composed in a gray sweater, a gelled undercut hairstyle and clean shave. Boyd clicked through a slideshow, projecting a photo Sierra took of herself on her MacBook Pro in a borrowed San Jose Sharks sweatshirt, with her hair curled and her tongue sticking out. Within the hour, Sierra had disappeared, Boyd said. The photo was taken at 7:12 a.m. on March 16, 2012 at her home in the Perry area north of Morgan Hill.Sierra normally caught the school bus around 7:30 a.m. and had made plans to meet up with her friend Karissa Pugh that morning, Boyd said. Sierra never made that bus. She never made that meeting. She never made it to school, Boyd said. It is a parents worst nightmare. Boyd played the 911 call recording of Marlene LaMars panicked, then choked up, crying voice reporting Sierras disappearance to dispatchers at 6:27 p.m. Security video images showed Garcia-Torres distinctive 1998 Volkswagen Jetta leaving the Maple Leaf RV Park where he lived eight miles south of Sierras bus stop at 7 a.m. the morning she disappeared. Further slides showed images of the rope and gloves where Sierras DNA had been found in the trunk of the Jetta, as well as Sierras backpack containing all of her clothing, bra, underwear, and other essentials like her inhaler and her lunch money. What does that leave Sierra? Boyd asked. That leaves her naked. Sierras jeans and sweatshirt, Boyd argued, were found with dirt stains consistent with stains that would be left if Sierra had been on her back, dragged by her feet. Reflective beads found in some roads were also found on her clothing. Her jeans also had a strong scent of human urine, Boyd said. On March 13, 2012, three days before Sierras disappearance, Garcia-Torres Safeway club card records reveal that he bought a 20-gallon jug of bleach and a turkey baster, neither of which was found in his trailer, Boyd said. Bleach breaks down DNA, Boyd said. Sierras body has never been found, and a few of the hundreds of volunteers who helped search for her showed up for the first day of the trial, some wearing the red Converse sneakers she loved. Sierra, Boyd said, had no reason to abandon everything she knew, loved and cared about. Were all glad this day has finally come, Steve LaMar told reporters outside the courthouse. Weve waited a long time for it. Opening statements wrapped up in a San Jose courtroom Tuesday. Prosecutor David Boyd continued his statement by rehashing two kidnapping attempts, which took place in the parking lots of two Morgan Hill Safeway stores, including the Tennant Avenue location where Garcia-Torres worked as a courtesy clerk. A stun gun that was collected as evidence in one of the attempts contained a nine-volt Duracell battery marked by Garcia-Torres left thumbprint, Boyd said. Records connected to Garcia-Torres sisters Safeway Club Card, which Boyd said the defendant used regularly at that time, list a purchase of the same nine-volt Duracell batteries hours before the kidnapping attempt. In his opening statement, defense attorney Al Lopez told jurors that Garcia-Torres then-manager at Safeway would testify at a later date that those batteries were too heavy for their packaging and often broke it open. Garcia-Torres could have left a thumbprint on one of them if he had picked up an open pack of batteries at the register, which, Lopez said, he could have had reason to do as a courtesy clerk. Lopez went on to attack the arguments made by prosecutors regarding physical evidence collected from Garcia-Torres distinctive 1998 Volkswagen Jetta and Sierras backpack. The black and gray polyester fibers found on Sierras clothing that Boyd described as indistinguishable from those found on the after-market floor mats in the Jetta are generic and can be found on any number of products, Lopez argued. The tiny reflective glass beads from the road found on Sierras clothing were not found in Garcia-Torres Jetta, Lopez said. Prosecutors have said that Garcia-Torres, described as an avid outdoorsman, had the outdoor knowledge to hide Sierras body in any number of remote locations. If shes taken somewhere in the wilderness, where did the glass beads come from? Lopez asked. Safeway Club Card records show that Garcia-Torres purchased a jug of bleach and a turkey baster three days before Sierra disappeared, items that Boyd suggested the defendant bought to break down DNA evidence of a sexual assault. Lopez pulled out a turkey baster and, using coffee filters and a rubber band, showed the jury how it could be used to manufacture concentrated marijuana hash oil. As for the bleach, Lopez said, there was nothing sinister about buying a gallon of bleach to get your socks white. Perhaps most significantly, Lopez argued that DNA evidence had been cross-contaminated during the collection process. Sierras hair, for example, was not found on the rope from the trunk of Garcia-Torres Jetta until months after being collected. Unlike fingerprints, DNA can be transferred, and some of the evidence presented by the prosecution was inconclusive. The complete picture is this is not gold-standard DNA. Its background DNA, Lopez said. What theyre presenting to you is not reliable. It doesnt prove who, how or when. Garcia-Torres smirked and laughed quietly to himself when Boyd played a video of his April 2012 interview with investigators from the Santa Clara County Sheriffs Office, in which a sergeant explains the spread of DNA evidence with a reference to a Reeses Peanut Butter Cup commercial. In that interview, the sergeant asks Garcia-Torres how his DNA may have been found on Sierras clothing, which was found covered in dirt stains and a strong odor of human urine three days after her disappearance. I like masturbating, so, ha, thats it, a 21-year-old Garcia-Torres says in the video, explaining that he kept tissue or toilet paper in his car for this purpose and that his DNA would have been carried on the tissue wherever he disposed of it outside. Boyd pointed out that prior to this, neither sergeant raises the subject of anything sexual or suggests that ejaculate was found on Sierras jeans. Lopez warned jurors about shaming evidence provided to distract and create bias against the defendant without proving the defendants culpability in crimes as charged. Youre not going to hear any evidence that she was killed, Lopez said. Absolutely none. By Bay City News",1

She followed that with a second tweet, saying: it was never my intention to say that these rumors were in fact true, i only tried to bring awareness to a growing problem that could happen ANYWHERE, including close to home. i apologize for any panic or harm caused by the tweet. She appears to be referencing the arrest last week of a police sergeant from Howell Township. Richard C. Conte, 47, was arrested Sept. 6 in Toms River, and is accused of trying to meet who he thought was a 15-year-old girl to have sex with her, according to a statement from Howell Township Police Chief Andrew J. Kudrick Jr. The teenage girl was in reality an undercover officer portraying a teen as part of a sting operation, Kudrick said. Conte was charged with luring, which is the criminal charge that applies to such instances. Typically in these cases the luring is a reference to the accused person contacting the minor through social media or websites. There are social media posts circulating with a slew of photos of men arrested on luring charges that include Contes photo, but no law enforcement agency has released information on other arrests. An email requesting further information from the state Attorney Generals office was not immediately answered. There has been no information released on where in Toms River Contes arrest occurred. In her original tweet, which has since been deleted but was shared on Facebook, Snapchat and other social media platforms via screenshots, she stated the parking lot on route 37 is apparently becoming a spot for human traffickers to kidnap victims!!!!! The flood of messages and inquiries prompted Toms River police to post on Facebook, saying they had no official criminal reports of anything of that nature. Please be aware that posting unsubstantiated rumors can rise to causing false public alarm which is a chargeable offense, Toms River police said. If you have been witness to something or feel in danger, call the police, do not post about it.

1479,"One suspect has been shot and killed, and two more arrested, after last weeks shooting of a north Georgia sheriffs deputy. On Friday, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents shot Avery Richard, 32, during an arrest attempt on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in Atlanta. At about 4 p.m., agents had tracked Richard to the Holmes Plaza parking lot. According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Richard was sitting inside a vehicle when he began shooting at FBI agents. One agent, a 30-year veteran, was shot in the arm and a female passenger who was in the vehicle with Richard also suffered from gunshot wounds. Both the agent and the woman were taken to Grady Memorial Hospital for medical treatment. Over the weekend, two more arrests were made in the shooting of Banks County Deputy Robert Wilkins. Dustin Terrell Heuatt, 29, was charged with numerous felonies, including aggravated assault on a peace officer, aggravated assault and armed robbery. James Hall Askew, 26, was charged with aiding and abetting. At about 4:12 p.m last Wednesday, deputies in Banks County — in northeast Georgia along I-85 and I-985 — responded to a report of an armed robbery in progress at the Atlanta Dragway race track. According to the Banks County Sheriffs Office, while deputies were en route, the robber — who has since been identified as Richard — attempted to kidnap a victim, but ended up fleeing the scene after stealing the victims car. Deputies located the vehicle in the area of the Tanger Outlet shopping center, where a traffic stop was attempted. Richard tried to drive away and, a short time later, got out of the vehicle and fired at a deputy. The deputy, who the sheriffs office has not identified, was shot while still in a patrol car. As Richard ran away, he continued to shoot toward the deputys patrol car, authorities said. Authorities say the bullet was blocked by a ballistic vest the deputy was wearing. The deputy was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for non-life threatening injuries. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said a kidnapping happened hours after the deputys shooting. A Commerce woman arrived at her home to find a man matching Richards description inside. Her home is about two miles away from where the deputy was shot. The intruder forced the woman at gunpoint to drive him to the metro Atlanta area before she was released, the GBI said. She sustained minor injuries in the incident. Since then, a multitude of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies had taken part in the search for Richard and the other suspects. Photos courtesy Banks County Sheriffs Office",1
1480,"- A 15-month-old boy allegedly abducted by his father and taken to Mexico last week was delivered to authorities at the Mexico border Monday by an uncle and an Amber Alert was canceled, authorities said. Noe Reyna was turned over to officers of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security at 2:45 p.m. the Otay Mesa border crossing by the uncle, who walked up with the boy, said Sgt. E. Yerkey of the Los Angeles Police Departments Hollenbeck Station. The father had the uncle deliver the boy, Yerkey said. The LAPD was contacted at 3:10 p.m. by Homeland Security and Hollenbeck detectives went to the border to pick him up. The father may have learned that authorities were looking for him from media attention and his family may have helped convince him to return the boy, Yerkey said. Noe was in the custody of the Department of Children and Family Services which had a warrant to remove the child from his home due to the parents drug use, he said. The boys mother was notified of his recovery. Social workers were due to pick up Noe Tuesday, which led to the alleged abduction by father Carlos Ivan Reyna Lara, 35, and the Amber Alert. He was believed to have taken the boy to the state of Sonora, Mexico. --City News Service/Photo via LAPD",1

1486,"Photo courtesy of law enforcement authorities A pre-trial hearing is scheduled next Wednesday for a Los Angeles man who allegedly overpowered and beat a 79-year-old woman in her South Pasadena home, putting her in the hospital. Alonzo Bernard Johnson, 52, is set for a hearing in Dept. T of the Alhambra Courthouse, 150 W. Commonwealth Ave. He is charged with one count each of first-degree burglary with a person present, first-degree residential robbery and kidnapping to commit another crime. The criminal complaint also alleges that Johnson personally inflicted great bodily injury on a victim over 70, personally used a knife and has seven criminal convictions dating back to 1981 for burglary, theft and attemptedrobbery. The victim left her front door open while waiting for her grandchildren to arrive to her home on the 1000 block of Indiana Avenue around 7:45 a.m. in 2012, said South Pasadena Detective Bill Earley. This was a crime of convenience, said Earley. The suspect saw the front door wide open. South Pasadena is safe and small town, but residents still need to lock their doors, he continued. The suspect walked in and asked to charge his cell phone, but when the victim told him to leave, he allegedly pulled out a kitchen knife and threatened to kill her, according to reports. While holding the knife against her, the suspect forced her into a rear bedroom, face down onto the bed and began beating her, police reported. Authorities said the woman was threatened with a paring knife taken from her kitchen, struck in the face by her assailants fists and taken to various parts of the home to try to find money. The attacker ran from the home with a fistful of jewelry when the womans grandchildren arrived, according to authorities. Johnson was arrested a short time later. If convicted, Johnson faces life in state prison with the possibility of parole, according to the District Attorneys Office. South Pasadena is safe and small town, but residents still need to lock their doors, he continued. Johnson was carrying an MTA pass, and allegedly took the Gold Line from Los Angeles to South Pasadena, said Earley. His last registered address was to a group home on Skid Row. Since the Gold Line has opened up, a lot more crime has happened in that area, he said. The police department pays a lot more attention to that area. Earley says Johnson has been in and out of jail since the 80s. He has used several aliases and has served time in state prison, according to reports. Previous felony arrests include robbery and burglary. Most recently, he was released from jail in July after serving time for a parole violation, said Earley. The victim was treated at a hospital for a broken nose, unspecified internal injuries, and numerous cuts and bruises; her grandchildren underwent counseling after the trauma of witnessing their grandmother being beaten, according to L.A. Now. The grandmother recovered from her injuries. --City News Service contributed to this story",1
1487,"Five suspects have been arrested and two more remain at-large and wanted by police following multiple armed robberies and an attempted kidnapping at a Norristown car dealership. The Montgomery County District Attorneys Office announced the results of the months-long, multi-agency investigation into the incidents on Monday afternoon. Authorities traced the suspects to a criminal organization that was behind at least three incidents at El Camino Motors — located on 747 E. Main Street in Norristown — the first of which occurred on April 30. Two of the suspects - Damon Murphy, 32, and Rebecca Roman 28, both of Philadelphia - along with a third, unidentified suspect, held up the clerk at El Camino at gunpoint at around 8:05 p.m., authorities said. The group came away with around $8,000 in cash, a wallet, an iPhone, and titles to 100 vehicles, according to the DA. A second incident took place on July 18. Three men — Charlie Franco, 30, Eric Santana, 35, and Theophilus Berry, 31, all of of Philadelphia — returned to El Camino, the DA said. Brandishing semiautomatic weapons, they robbed an employee of $1,200, and then tried to force him into a waiting vehicle outside, according to police. The victim was able to escape, however. Franco and Santana were arrested on July 24, which led to the final incident, on Aug. 1. Their associate Michael Dukes, 27, of Norristown phoned the victim who had escaped and who was still employed at El Camino motors and arranged to meet him, the DA said. Police staked out the dealership. When Dukes arrived, he displayed a gun in his waistband, and told the victim he had to lie at the upcoming preliminary hearing for the pair, police said. Authorities moved in and took Dukes into custody. The investigation continued. Police tracked down and arrested Murphy and Berry on Sept. 7. Roman and another suspect, Calvin Berkins, 29, of Philadelphia, are the two that remain at large. Roman is Hispanic, 5 feet, 5 inches tall, and about 135 pounds.

San Diego police Officer Dan Lasher said they no longer believe a kidnap had occurred. But it was not clear if action would be taken against his family, who had told officers the boy had possibly been abducted, triggering an Amber Alert across the southern part of California.

1492,"In response to recent questions regarding the San Diego Police Departments purchase of a cell phone tracking device, the City Attorneys Office Monday released documents that explain what it does and why details need to be kept secret. Last week, the inewsource website reported that the nonprofit First Amendment Coalition sued the city of San Diego and the police department to get them to release documents related to the use of the International Mobile Subscriber IdentityCatchers device called Stingray. According to inewsource, the Stingray was developed by the military. The Stingray works by mimicking cell phone towers. By capturing signals from targeted cell phones, police can obtain locations, outgoing calls, text messages and other information, according to inewsource, which reported that the SDPD has only made public a heavily redacted purchase order for $33,000.  Stay on top of Patchs local coverage by subscribing to the daily Patch newsletter right here. Todays release of documents by the City Attorneys Office included a generic explainer of Stingray written by the U.S. Department of Justice; a copy of a court ruling that allowed the Tucson Police Department to withholdinformation about the device; and an affidavit from a top FBI technology official. The explainer, meant to be a template for local agencies, says: The cell site simulator is a particularly effective tool and has assisted greatly in keeping the citizens of (LEAs jurisdiction or community) safe. LEA standsfor Law Enforcement Agency. It goes on to say that the need for secrecy has unfortunately led to widely held misconceptions about the device. Police are required to get a court order before using the device, except in emergency situations involving kidnapping, missing children or evidence that a criminal act could lead to death of serious bodily injury, in whichpaperwork would be filed later, the document says. It says secrecy is required so that criminals dont learn how to avoid detection. In the court ruling, police in Tucson released some information regarding its Stingray, but not others. A reporters lawsuit to get the rest of the documentation was denied after a judge reviewed the materials in question. In his declaration, Bradley Morrison, chief of the FBIs Tracking Technology Unit, says publication of details about the Stingray could lead to the development of countermeasures. Law enforcement agencies that take the cell phone trackers sign a nondisclosure agreement, he said. The City Attorneys Office said city and police officials would have no further comment, and that further questions should be referred to the U.S. Justice Department.

He allegedly frequented areas in the San Gabriel Valley, including El Monte, Monterey Park and Temple City, along with the city of Lynwood. He targets women on major thoroughfares. He targets women that are addicted to drugs or are drug users and he has proven to be violent. He targets women that are more vulnerable than most, sheriffs Lt. Todd Deeds told reporters. The number of years that hes been doing it, for over five years, we believe there are other victims out there, and thats what we want — people to come forward. We want you to know that Mr. Yu is in custody and we want you to feel safe notifying law enforcement. And we feel that weve taken a predator off the street. Yu was arrested May 24 at his workplace in Irwindale by detectives from the sheriffs Major Crimes Bureau. He has been behind bars since then in lieu of $1.37 million. Authorities believe there might be additional victims. Anyone with information related to the investigation was asked to call the departments Special Victims Bureau at (877) 710-5273. — City News Service, photo courtesy of the LASD",0
1497,"- An infant whose been missing for more than a week was found Wednesday afternoon on the citys West Side, Chicago police said in a tweet Wednesday afternoon. Three-month-old Royalty Wolf was last seen May 14 when her biological mother Mikequera Randolph, 24, is said to have kidnapped the infant during a supervised DCFS home visit. The baby was found near Flournoy and Francisco. Police said Randolph took off but was apprehended shortly after. The Chicago Fire Department took Royalty to Stroger Hospital for an evaluation. Police have not commented on the babys condition. Friends of Royaltys foster mother said she has not been able to see the baby.

1498,"Federal authorities on Tuesday charged three men from rural central Illinois with the bombing of a Minnesota mosque last year and said one of the suspects told an investigator the goal of the attack was to scare Muslims out of the United States. A statement from the U.S. attorneys office in Springfield, Illinois, says the men also are suspected in the attempted bombing of an abortion clinic in November. The Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minnesota, was bombed just before morning prayers on Aug. 5, causing extensive damage although no one was injured or killed. There was an attempt bomb the Champaign, Illinois, Womens Health Practice on Nov. 7. The three men are identified as Michael B. Hari, 47; Joe Morris, 22; Michael McWhorter, 29. All are from Clarence, a rural community 35 miles north of Champaign-Urbana. A fourth man was charged with a gun offense, but he was not identified as a suspect bombing or attempted bombing. McWhorter allegedly told an FBI agent during an interview that the three rented a pickup in Champaign and drove to Minnesota with a plan to bomb the mosque, according to a criminal complaint. He said they wanted to let Muslims know they are not welcome in the United States and scare them out of the country, according notes taken by the FBI. It wasnt clear from the complaint why the men may have targeted a mosque so far from Illinois.Morris told one informant that Hari had promised to pay him and McWhorter $18,000 for participating in the mosque bombing, according to the complaint. McWhorter also allegedly admitted that the three men tried to bomb the abortion clinic on Nov. 7, again renting a truck to carry out the attack. McWhorter described a PVC pipe bomb and said Morris broke a window and threw it in, where it failed to go off, according to the complaint. RELATED: Former Deputy Who Abducted Daughters Wants To Build Trumps Wall The complaint also said nothing about a possible motivation for the clinic attack. The complaint said a tip led authorities to investigate the men, with a person sending the Ford County sheriff photos of guns and bomb-making material inside Haris parents home, where Hari often stayed. The tipster eventually became one of two informants in the case, according to the complaint. Hari is the owner of the global security firm Crisis Resolution Security Services, and his company was one of the more than 700 contractors that expressed interest in working on President Donald Trumps proposed border wall between the United States and Mexico. RELATED: Rep. Keith Ellison Calls On Trump To Condemn Minnesota Mosque Bombing A former Ford County sheriffs deputy, Hari also was convicted of child abduction in 2006 after he fled to Mexico and Belize with his daugther during a custody battle with his ex-wife. After taking his daughters — ages 15 and 13 at the time — Hari was featured on episodes of Dr. Phil, and Dr. Phil McGraw and show representatives were apparently able to talk him into returning to the country with the girls. Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Muslim advocacy and civil liberties group Council on American-Islamic Relations, welcomed news of the arrests. This is definitely a relief that this case is finally to conclusion and those assailants-slash-suspects are apprehended and no longer a threat to our community, Hussein said in a telephone interview Tuesday. The mosque primarily serves Somalis in the Minneapolis area. Minnesota is home to the largest Somali community outside of east Africa, with an estimated 57,000 people, according to the most recent census estimates. Mohamed Omar, the centers executive director, said at the time that the mosque didnt receive any threats beforehand or claims of responsibility afterward. The FBI had offered a $30,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction in the bombing. Officials said at the time that witnesses saw someone throw something from a truck or van before the blast and saw a vehicle speed away afterward. Mosque leaders later released security video from inside the mosque that caught the moments before the explosion, and some smoke and flying debris. The video didnt show the blast itself. Gov. Mark Dayton called the bombing an act of terrorism when he and other officials visited the mosque the day after the explosion.

1499,"A Burlington County man has been indicted on charges of kidnapping and murder in connection with death of a man whose skeletal remains were discovered in a wooded area in Jackson in March, Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph D. Coronato announced Thursday. Alan McGinnis, 27, of Pemberton, was indicted by an Ocean County grand jury in the death of Cody MacPherson, said Al Della Fave, spokesman for the prosecutors office. MacPherson, 20, was reported missing to the Pemberton Township Police Department on Sept. 24, 2017. He had moved to the Browns Mills section of the township from Portage, Indiana not long before he was killed. McGinnis is accused of stabbing MacPherson to death in the early hours of Sept. 24, 2017, and then dumping his body in the Colliers Mills Wildlife Management Area, where it remained until March 19, when Richard Byrne, a district warden with the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, was walking through the area and discovered the remains. (READ MORE: Skeleton Found During Controlled Burn In Jackson: Prosecutor) Byrne was preparing the area for the burn when he observed human remains under logs close to the area of the burn, Della Fave said. He then moved closer and noticed what he believed to be a human skull. Byrne called his supervisor and the burn was halted so they could preserve evidence. Authorities were able to make a preliminary identification of MacPherson based on dental records and the cause of death ruled to be a stab wound to the left abdomen. He was positively identified through DNA analysis by the New Jersey State Police laboratory on April 17, 2018.

McGinnis allegedly traveled back to Pemberton, where the scene was cleaned of visible blood and other evidence of the murder, they allege. Authorities allege he returned a week later to the site where they say he left MacPherson to destroy evidence associated with the crime. McGinnis was indicted on charges of first-degree kidnapping, for allegedly driving MacPherson from Pemberton to Jackson;, two charges first-degree murder, for allegedly causing the injury and allegedly causing the death during a kidnapping; possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, unlawful possession of weapon, and desecrating human remains, for allegedly leaving MacPherson in the wildlife area and covering his body with logs, according to the indictment.

The two were housemates. Steven Vander Briel was sentenced by Fredericksburg Circuit Court Judge Gordon F. Willis Tuesday to life in prison, plus 11 years and was also told to pay $5,000 toward the costs of Manns funeral expenses.

1503,"A parent who was killed after taking a Riverside teacher hostage this week, prompting an hours-long standoff, was unarmed, according to a report. The suspect, identified as Luvelle Kennon, took Linda Montgomery, a longtime teacher, hostage at Castle View Elementary School after he struck a male substitute teacher, according Riverside police. In a Press-Enterprise article on Wednesday, it was revealed that Kennon was unarmed when he was shot by police after negotiations failed. Kennon barricaded himself and Montgomery in a classroom around 11 a.m. Tuesday. Emergency negotiators communicated with Kennon for hours trying to convince him to surrender before entering the classroom around 6 p.m., police said. An officer-involved shooting involving the Riverside SWAT team ensued and the suspect was shot. Montgomery was unharmed but taking to a local hospital for an evaluation, police said. A Police Department spokesperson told the Press Enterprise that their major concerns included the fact that they were only intermittently able to speak with Kennon and that he wouldnt allow them to see or speak to the hostage. Montgomery had also been held hostage for roughly seven hours without food or water, the newspaper reported. All students and staff were evacuated to Castle View Park immediately after the incident was reported, officials said.

1504,"The key witness in a Bay Area police sexual exploitation scandal who prosecutors need to come back to California to file charges against seven current and former law enforcement officers has been released from a Florida jail. California attorneys Pamela Price and Charles Bonner announced in a statement that the 19-year-old woman known as Celeste Guap pleaded no contest to misdemeanor simple battery today. While they did not immediately disclose the conditions of the plea deal, they said it contained a stipulation that she would not have a criminal record. Price stood by the just-released Guap at a news conference in Florida later today announcing their intention to return to California, where the officers involved are expected to be prosecuted, and Price said she would file a lawsuit against an undisclosed number of officers. Price addressed Guap by her legal name, Jasmine Abuslin. Celeste Guap is dead, Price said. Celeste Guap is a woman whose name and picture has been blasted over the news with Kardashian-like celebrity status but Jasmine is a young woman who is going to find herself and has dreams of becoming a veterinarian, Price said. Jasmine is glad to be free and wants to go home, Price said. She said they have arranged for her to get medical treatment at Stanford University when they return. Abuslin went to a Florida rehabilitation facility last month with the assistance of the Richmond Police Department but was swiftly arrested for allegedly assaulting a guard and was jailed for the last 17 days on $300,000 bail, rankling Alameda County prosecutors because of her key role in bringing the charges against the seven officers. Price said that Abuslin is not a drug addict and accused the Richmond Police Department of sending her to the Florida facility under false pretenses, potentially tampering with a witness. Richmond police interim Chief Allwyn Brown said in a report issued earlier this week that allegations that the department sent her there distort reality. Instead, Brown said the department helped her get funds from the states Victim Compensation Program so she could receive treatment. But Price said the facility was incapable of providing the kind of care that Abuslin needs. We have many lovely facilities in the Bay Area and throughout California. The kind of treatment she needs is not from a drug rehab facility, Price said. As a lawyer, I dont tamper with witnesses, she said. She is a witness to criminal activity, to criminal conspiracy in the Bay Area. There is no reason at all for why she is in Florida. Abuslin is expected to testify against seven current and former law enforcement officers, including five from the Oakland Police Department, who Alameda County District Attorney Nancy OMalley announced last week would be facing criminal charges. The most serious charges are for two officers accused of felony oral copulation with a minor. Price said Abuslin has been a victim of sex trafficking since she was 12 years old. She came under investigation by the Oakland Police Department last year for a relationship she had with Officer Brendan OBrien, who killed himself in September 2015 and implicated himself and other officers in a suicide note. Her attorneys have continued to suggest that there may be more such victims of exploitation who have not come forward.Bay Area police officers engaged in a conspiracy to sexually traffic children. She is not the only one, Price said. Its happening every day. It happened in a lot of different places under a lot of different circumstances. Payment can be money, it can be intimidation, it can be I will let you live today. I will kill you in this room. she said. This child has been kidnapped, she has been held against her will. The fact that she is alive today is a miracle. Despite the Oakland police internal investigation being opened last year, details of the scandal did not emerge publicly until May. Other departments, such as in Richmond and Livermore, did not learn of their officers involvement until after the case was reported in the media. Since then, dozens of officers in at least eight different law enforcement agencies have been implicated. Last week, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf announced that 12 Oakland police officers would be disciplined, including four who would be fired. Days later, OMalley announced criminal charges against five Oakland police officers, a Livermore officer and a Contra Costa County sheriffs deputy. A total of 11 Richmond police officers were investigated in connection with the scandal. Brown said this week that some of them would be fired or disciplined but refused to provide further details. Former Contra Costa County sheriffs Deputy Ricardo Perez and Oakland police Officer Giovanni LoVerde are each facing charges of felony oral copulation with a minor. If convicted, they could face 16 months to three years in state prison. Perez will also be charged with two counts of engaging in a lewd act in a public place. Former Livermore police Officer Dan Black will be charged with two counts of engaging in an act of prostitution and two counts of lewd acts in public. Oakland police Officer Brian Bunton faces one count of felony conspiracy to obstruct justice, which carries a possible sentence of a year in prison, and one misdemeanor charge of engaging in an act of prostitution. Retired Oakland police Officer Leroy Johnson will be charged with one count of failing to report sexual misconduct concerning a minor. Oakland police Officer Warit Utappa will be accused of searching official criminal justice data and computer systems for an unauthorized purpose. Former Oakland police Officer Tyrell Smith, who resigned in May, faces four counts of the same crime. Price called for possible federal intervention because of the widespread regional allegations. A federal judge overseeing court-mandated reforms to the Oakland Police Department as part of a 2003 settlement agreement already stepped in once in March, questioning the integrity of the departments internal affairs investigation. In his latest report issued Monday, court-appointed monitor Robert Warshaw said that while he was satisfied with the conclusion of the investigation, he was concerned about how it was initially handled. He reiterated that the fallout from the scandal has led to perhaps the most trying time in OPDs history. Judge Thelton Henderson wrote in his March 23 order, This case raises most serious concerns that may well impact Defendants ability to demonstrate their commitment to accountability and sustainability - both of which are key to ending court oversight. In his report Monday, Warshaw wrote, While there still remain some issues to be resolved regarding the sufficiency of resources devoted to the investigation until the matter was brought to the attention of the Court, we recognize the efforts of the City, OPD, and its leadership on this extensive investigation.

1505,"A northeast Georgia sheriffs deputy was shot Wednesday and investigators believe the shooter forced a woman at gunpoint to drive him to the Atlanta area. At about 4:12 p.m Wednesday, deputies in Banks County — in northeast Georgia along I-85 and I-985 — responded to a report of an armed robbery in progress at the Atlanta Dragway race track. According to the Banks County Sheriffs Office, while deputies were en route, the robber attempted to kidnap a victim, but ended up fleeing the scene after stealing the victims car. Deputies located the vehicle in the area of the Tanger Outlet shopping center, where a traffic stop was attempted. The suspect tried to drive away and, a short time later, got out of the vehicle and fired at a deputy. The deputy, who the sheriffs office has not identified, was shot while still in a patrol car. As the suspect ran away, he continued to shoot toward the deputys patrol car. Authorities say the bullet was blocked by a ballistic vest the deputy was wearing. The deputy was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for non-life threatening injuries. On Thursday, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said a kidnapping happened hours after the deputys shooting. A Commerce woman arrived at her home to find a man matching the description of the shooter inside. Her home is about two miles away from where the deputy was shot. The intruder forced the woman at gunpoint to drive him to the metro Atlanta area before she was released, the GBI said. She sustained minor injuries in the incident. Investigators were continuing to work Thursday to determine the time and location of the suspect arriving in the Atlanta area. The shooter is described as a black male in his 40s with short hair, standing about 6 tall and weighing about 170 pounds. He was wearing what was described as dark clothing. He is believed to have at least two handguns. The GBI and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the identity and capture of the suspect. Anyone with information is asked to call the GBI tip line at 1-800-597 -8477, Jackson County Sheriffs Office at 706-367-3784, or the Banks County Sheriffs Office at 706-677-2248.

1506,"A man who beat and strangled his neighbor and co- worker in her Riverside apartment more than two decades ago was sentenced Friday to 26 years to life in state prison. A Riverside jury in March convicted 58-year-old Leonard Terrance Woods of Moreno Valley of murder and a sentence-enhancing allegation of using a deadly weapon during a felony in the slaying of Judith Goodman. Riverside County Superior Court Judge Michael Donner imposed the sentence required by law. Woods killed Goodman, 44, in her Gould Street residence in February 1992. A DNA match linked the defendant to the womans murder when a 2010 forensic re-examination of the evidence was undertaken by the Riverside Police Department Cold Case Squad, whose investigators submitted clippings of the victims fingernails to a state crime lab for analysis. A profile of the killer was developed, and not long afterward, investigators sought out Woods for a sample of his DNA, which he provided in response to a court order. The profile showed the odds of anyone other than the defendant contributing the genetic evidence found under Goodmans fingernails were 1 in 7 billion, according to the prosecution. The victims immediate neighbors heard her cry for help twice shortly before dawn on Feb. 26, 1992, and heard a loud bang inside her apartment that prompted them to call 911. Two patrol officers arrived about 6 a.m. and noticed Goodmans front door slightly ajar, so they rapped on it with their flashlights and asked whether everything was alright inside. After knocking several times, they heard a male voice respond from within the unit, Who is it? What do you want? When the officers identified themselves, the door was slammed shut and double- bolted. The patrolmen saw a window had been broken out and feared a hostage situation, at which point they summoned SWAT personnel, who forced their way into the apartment less than an hour later, tossing a flash-bang grenade just prior to entering the unit, which had been soaked with gasoline. The officers spotted Goodman lying on her kitchen floor, her head in a pool of blood. She was partially disrobed, gagged with duct tape, and bound at the wrists and ankles with zip ties. Officers carried her lifeless body out of the apartment as it caught fire from the grenade igniting the gas. The entire four-unit complex turned into an inferno. Investigators questioned Woods immediately after Goodmans death and noticed scratch marks on his face, which he attributed to a tussle with his then-girlfriend. Detectives suspected him but did not have enough evidence to proceed with an arrest after the killing. Woods and Goodman worked at Rohr manufacturing, and it was his recommendation that prompted the victim to move to the apartment complex, prosecutors said. An autopsy revealed that Goodman had been beaten about the face and head, causing deep lacerations, but they were not fatal. A decorative hay hook that had been mounted on the wall of her apartment was found near her body and could have been used in the assault, investigators said. Medical examiners ultimately determined that the probable cause of death was strangulation. – By City News Service. Image via Shutterstock.",1

The couple had been married for just a few months, according to police. Mount Pleasant police told reporters that her husband found her hiding at a friends house, dragged her from the house, attacked her with the hatchet and took her to the Super 8 motel where he was staying. She was struck in the face, neck, head and body with the hatchet. The husband has been identified in Racine County Jail records as Cristian Loga-Negru, 38, and hes being held in the jail on a $1 million bail. Hell face charges of mayhem with a deadly weapon — a charge lodged when deliberate disfigurement is intended — kidnapping and first degree intentional homicide while armed. Hes due in court Friday afternoon. She actually came to Mount Pleasant to try and hide from her husband because she feared for her safety. A very traumatic incident occurred, and as a result a woman lost her life, Mount Pleasant Police Sgt. Eric Relich said. Loga-Negrus booking photo shows scratches on his face. The wife, 36, has not been publicly identified pending notification of her family. The woman had obtained a restraining order against her husband and weapons were removed from the mans house, according to police. The Racine County Eye reports that the woman was returning to her friends house at 8:20 p.m. after going somewhere to pick up the friends dog. The suspect was hiding out at the house and waited for her to come back, Relich said. It is unknown how the suspect discovered where the victim was staying. He dragged her to his car. Her screams alerted neighbors who called 911. The husband drove to the nearby Super 8 motel, 1150 Oakes Road. At about 9:30 p.m., the mans father reportedly alerted the motel manager to call police. The woman was seen bleeding in the back seat of the vehicle. She was flown by Flight for Life to a nearby hospital but died at about 10 p.m. Wednesday. Police arrested Loga-Negru at the motel without incident. Loga-Negrus LinkedIn profile states that hes in the trading and financial services business.

She was expected back in court Monday to make the restraining order permanent. Arlington Heights police told the Tribune that officers responded to the couples home on three domestic abuse calls this year. I can tell you we are familiar with the couple, said Arlington Heights police Sgt. Rich Sperando, who said the wife was trying to get out of the relationship. Neighbors told NBC Chicago they also knew there was trouble in the household, and that Loga-Negru was not a friendly man. Everyone in the building, they say hi to each other and stuff, neighbor Stephanie Gomez told NBC Chicago. We are all civil, and this guy was just there. He was just rude.

Original post, 8:09 p.m. —Bethel police are warning parents to be on the lookout for a man driving a dark-colored sedan after the attempted kidnapping of a student on their way home from school, police said. On Sept. 1, 2016 at approximately 3:30 p.m., Bethel Police responded to a report of a man trying to lure a 12-year-old juvenile into a car, Lt. Libertini said. The student said they were walking home from the bus stop at about 3:15 p.m. and was approached by the operator of a black 4-door sedan, police said. The victim told police that the operator of the vehicle asked the juvenile if they needed a ride home but the student declined. The driver demanded that they get in the car and the student fled from the area, police said. Lt. Libertini said the description provided to police was of an approximately 40-year-old white male, black hair that was slicked back, clean shaven, muscular build, with a deep voice. The vehicle was described as one similar to a black Ford Crown Victoria possibly bearing Connecticut plates. Lt. Libertini said the student was never physically contacted by the operator of the vehicle. The neighborhood of the incident was not reported to Patch. Libertini said parents are encouraged to speak with their children about the dangers of getting in or near vehicles that are unknown to them. With most children now having their own cell phones, parents are asked to discuss the appropriate times to dial 911. Being approached by a stranger and being asked to enter a vehicle or otherwise leave with a stranger is cause to call 911. They will not be in trouble for calling 911 if a situation that is of concern to them turns out to be benign, he said in a statement. Anyone with information about the vehicle and/or the operator is asked to contact the Bethel Police at (203) 744-7900. Image via Google Earth",0
1512,"Sign up for the Smyrna-Vinings Patch newsletter! --- Smyrna police have released a composite sketch of the suspect in an attempted child abduction which allegedly occurred on Aug. 5 as a middle school student was walking home from class. According to Chief David Lee, an 11-year-old girl from the Heritage at Vinings neighborhood was walking home from Campbell Middle School when she was approached by a white male driving a black truck. The young girl said the truck followed her for a time, then the driver said that the girls mother had an emergency and that the girl should get in the truck right away.  Thinking quickly, the girl asked the driver if he knew what her mothers name was. He did not, but continued to insist the girl get in the truck. The girl picked a nearby house and walked towards it as if it was her own, she said. Once she put her books down on the front steps of the house the man drove away, according to the girls story. Lee said in an Aug. 6 statement that investigators have a good lead in the case, and added that his department is working hand in hand with other local law enforcement agencies including the Cobb County Campus Police. Smyrna police say the suspect is a white male in his 30s with a brown goatee who was last seen driving a black, four door truck with tinted windows.

1514,"Takoma Parks new chief of police Alan Goldberg was sworn in last month and said the transition to becoming the new chief has been smooth and enjoyable. Goldberg, who grew up in Aspen Hill, came out of retirement because he said he wasnt done doing what he loved to do yet. Goldberg has nearly 30 years of law enforcement experience with the Montgomery County Police Department. Takoma Park Patch: What do you see as the biggest crime-related issues facing Takoma Park? Alan Goldberg: Gangs are one of the number one issues. Its not just Takoma Park; its only 2.5 square miles granted, so any of these crime issues are really regional. I think that the associated violence and gang culture is certainly detrimental to the quality of life. While we dont have a lot of gang-on-gang violence here, and we dont really have gang-related crime, gang members do commit the crimes, so I think thats one of the priorities. Theres always going to be a trend that pops up, like when we had a burglary trend, but we made arrests in that. Of course weve had serious crime like the armored-car robbery in Langley Park and the shooting related to it. Those violent crimes are certainly a priority. Patch: What concerns has the public raised about safety and how will you connect with the public? AG: Some concerns were raised regarding the burglary trend in the neighborhood. There was a lot of misinformation, so we put the message out. Theres always a difference between perception of crime and reality that we still have to address. Through being open and honest, itll lay the fears of most of the people. Most of the concerns are still traffic-related. Im perfectly happy thats one of the concerns… crime is down. Most of the residents have referenced speed cameras and things like that. Patch: Why did you decide to go into law enforcement and what advice do you have for people who want to go into the field? AG: Ive been doing this for a long time and the reasons havent really changed. I like the challenge of not knowing whats going to happen when coming to work. Its not routine; its a challenge. You can be sitting here doing paperwork one day and the next day youre having a hostage situation or saving someones life. I really enjoy it; I feel like Im giving something back and I get a lot of reward from that. Thats why I went into it—I wanted something that wasnt the same old thing. My dad was an electrical engineer for most of his life, but he was police officer in New York for three years. I never heard exciting stories about electrical engineering, but he kept repeating the same old war stories of being a cop. That piqued my interest and put me in that direction when I was younger. Just hearing some of those stories—I just knew it from early on. I started in 1978 and I would recommend people to get that educational background; get a degree in criminal justice or psychology. It will definitely help them in the long run in the career as a profession. Try to finish that degree and look for the place they want to work. Patch: Are there any plans to improve the police department in the future? AG: Were trying to improve the technology and cars. Were also trying to improve communications and have the ability to communicate with the other agencies. We can talk to other police departments, but we dont always have the ability to listen to dispatch channels. One of the goals Ive set is to come up with some technology to allow us to know whats going on across the street. Patch: What have been your proudest accomplishments and/or most memorable experiences? AG: From a personnel aspect, a lot of people I supervised have made rank and are now in positions of leadership in the department. Thats really the legacy. Thats my biggest accomplishment: the people Ive mentored who have made a positive change. From a personal standpoint, I still remember when I was a DC police officer for a couple years in a poor high-rise public housing project; we had a call for child neglect. There were some kids in there, and a girl taking care of an infant or toddler was no more than seven years old. There was no food in the refrigerator, so we brought them food and McDonalds. Sitting there, the girl just put her arm around my leg, grabbed me and hugged me. Those are some of the things—its one life that you touch, but hopefully you did something positive.",0

1518,"The California Supreme Court in San Francisco today unanimously upheld the death penalties of a Sacramento couple for the murder, kidnapping and rape of a 22-year-old Pleasanton woman in 1997. James Daveggio, 57, and Michelle Michaud, 59, were given the death penalties in Alameda County Superior Court in 2002 for kidnapping Vanessa Lei Samson on the morning of Dec. 2, 1997, raping her with modified curling irons and murdering her by strangulation with a rope. During the sentencing, Superior Court Judge Larry Goodman called the murder vile, cruel, senseless, depraved, brutal, evil and vicious. The couple abducted Samson into Michauds green Dodge minivan as she walked to her job at an insurance company and assaulted her during a trip to Lake Tahoe. Samsons body was found two days later, in the snow on an embankment along state Highway 88 in Alpine County. Daveggio and Michaud were also convicted in the 2002 trial of the oral copulation of Daveggios daughter, then 16, and the daughters friend, then 17, on Nov. 3 and 27, 1997. Prosecutors alleged the crimes were part of a spree of utter depravity in which the two sexually assaulted a series of girls and young women during their 13-month relationship in 1996 and 1997. Goodman allowed prosecutors to present testimony during the trial from four other alleged victims of 1997 assaults that were not charged in the Alameda County case, but he excluded evidence of alleged sexual attacks on 11 other victims whom prosecutors had hoped to bring to the stand. Two of the alleged victims who did testify were Michauds daughter and a friend of the daughter, who were 12 and 13 when they were allegedly forced into sexual acts by the couple in the fall of 1997. Another victim who testified was a then-20-year-old Reno college student who was kidnapped and assaulted on Sept. 29, 1997. Like Samson, she was abducted into the van as she walked by the side of a road. Although that case was not charged as part of the Alameda County trial, Daveggio and Michaud were separately convicted of kidnapping in federal court in Reno in 1999. The two were arrested by the FBI on Dec. 3, 1997, the day after Samsons murder, on kidnapping charges in the Reno case. After being convicted in the federal case, they were transferred to Alameda County for trial on the state charges. In a 98-page decision, the state high court rejected a series of appeal arguments, including the defendants claim that evidence from the uncharged cases should not have been allowed. The court said the testimony was admissible to show the distinctive characteristics of the couples motive and methods. Justice Leondra Kruger, the author of the courts opinion, wrote, The evidence concerning the uncharged incidents shed light on whether Daveggio and Michaud had a propensity to commit acts of sexual misconduct. The couples direct appeal to the California Supreme Court was the first step in the death penalty appeal process. They can continue appeals through habeas corpus petitions in the federal court system. Michaud is one of 23 women among the 746 inmates on death row in California. Executions in the state have been on hold since 2006 because of a federal lawsuit challenging execution procedures.  By Bay City News Photo via Shutterstock",1

1520,"Two Howard County teens were indicted Tuesday in the murder of a 13-year-old girl. David E. Eisenhauer, 19, of Columbia, and Natalie M. Keepers, 19, of Laurel, were indicted on charges that carry the possibility of life in prison. The grand jury in Christiansburg, Virginia, added a new charge — concealment — in Eisenhauers case, according to The Roanoke Times. Prosecutors said that Eisenhauer and Keepers, who both attended Virginia Tech, planned the killing of a Blacksburg middle school girl. Nicole Madison Lovell, 13, described her alleged killer, Eisenhauer, as her boyfriend after the two met on Facebook, according to The Washington Post. The prosecutor in the case reportedly said there was no evidence of sexual contact when the body was found, which would have made Eisenhauer eligible for the death penalty. Instead, Eisenhauer faces the possibility of life in prison for murder, 10 years for abduction and five years for concealment, according to The Roanoke Times. Keepers was indicted on a charge of accessory before the fact and concealing a body, which could result in life plus five years in prison. The murder case started with a missing persons report on Wednesday, Jan. 27. Several agencies became involved in the search for the 13-year-old Lovell, who required vital medication for a liver transplant, according to Blacksburg Police. The girls family members said they discovered she was missing when they tried to administer the medication Wednesday morning and found the dresser pushed against her bedroom door. Her remains were found Saturday, Jan. 30, just over the state line in Surry County, North Carolina. The preliminary cause of Lovells death was stabbing. Prosecutors alleged that Keepers and Eisenhauer planned the murder, which involved him luring the girl out of her apartment thinking she was going on a date, then slitting her throat at a site that the two suspects picked out together before dumping her body. Trials are set for both Keepers and Eisenhauer in early 2017. She will have pretrial hearings starting Jan. 17, while he will begin motions hearings on Feb. 8, according to the ABC affiliate in Virginia. The prosecutor in the case has reportedly said that she will not offer plea deals in the case. Pictured, David E. Eisenhauer and Natalie M. Keepers. Photo Credit: Montgomery County, VA, Jail.",1

1522,"- Investigators are learning more about the criminal history of the adoptive mother of seven special needs children who was arrested last week. According to investigators, Paula Sinclair has a criminal history dating back more than a decade in at least five states, that include Texas, California, New York, New Jersey and Louisiana, with charges such as fraud, theft, forgery and burglary. A CPS spokesperson told KPRC that prior to 2006, background checks for prospective parents only covered crimes committed in Texas. That year the requirement was expanded to include the entire U.S., however the all of the children, which were adopted out of foster care came to Sinclair between 2003 and 2004. Seven special needs children who were found to be malnourished and living in deplorable conditions have been placed in state custody. The children, who were all between the ages of 14 and 16-years old, were adopted between April 2003 and October 2004 by Paula Sinclair, 54, and her husband, who does not live at the house and is not facing charges. Sinclair and Allen Richardson, 78 were arrested on Saturday and face felony charges of aggravated kidnapping and injury to a child. According to a Houston Chronicle report, the arrests came after investigators with the Fort Bend County Sheriffs Office launched an investigation following a decision last month by Child Protective Services to remove seven adopted children from their home in the Long Meadow Farms subdivision.  The children, which included two 14-year-olds, four 15-year-olds, and one 16-year-old, were malnourished, locked in a room and were beaten periodically with a paddle or a wooden spoon, according to investigators. According to police, all seven children stayed in one room at the house, but when Sinclair needed to take Richardson for doctors appointments, the children were kept in a small closet. Police said that often, Sinclair and Richard were absent so long, the children would urinate or defecate on themselves. One of the children, who suffers from Down syndrome, was found wearing a filthy diaper, and all of the children were wearing worn, shabby clothing, according to police. The children were removed from the home and taken to the Fort Bend County Childrens Advocacy Center in Rosenberg, where they were to be interviewed before being taken to a Houston hospital for treatment. Those who are able to speak are helping investigators, officials said. Police said Sinclair also operated a group home for adults at the same time and that three men lived in the downstairs area of the home. A resident at the group home told KPRC that the adults lived on the first floor and the children were kept in an upstairs bedroom, and were told not to speak with the children upstairs. I have never been upstairs, David Willard said. I have never been upstairs in five months. Of course, I was told not to speak to anybody here. Meanwhile, CPS officials released the following statement about the case: Seven children, (five boys and two girls from age 13 to 16), were removed by Child Protective Services (CPS) from a home in Richmond on Wednesday, Nov. 23, following a report to CPS that alleged possible physical abuse. The report was received Tuesday afternoon, Nov. 22, and a caseworker responded immediately. The children, who were all adopted, are receiving complete physical examinations and will be placed in foster care. The affidavit to support the removal of the children was filed Wednesday, Nov. 23 in Fort Bend Countys 505th State District Court and CPS was granted temporary custody by Judge Cindy Aguirre. CPS is continuing a joint investigation with the Fort Bend County Sheriffs Department. Image: Shutterstock/Fort Bend County Sheriffs Office",1

The Second District Detective Bureau said in a blog post that it is not yet clear if the two crimes are connected. Parents are asked to be mindful of their childs path of travel to school. Kids should be advised to travel lit roads when walking and not to take shortcuts through yards, etc, Cleveland Police said in a blog post. Young children should be accompanied by an adult or older children. Children walking to school should travel in groups or pairs whenever feasible. The first incident happened Feb. 1. An 18-year-old was walking in the area of W. 67th and Clark Ave. at about 7 a.m. Thats when someone grabbed him, punched him and dragged the boy down a street while threatening him with a knife. The teenager struggled against his attacker and was able to break free and run for it. Then, on Feb. 13, at about 6:30 a.m., a 12-year-old boy walking in the area of W. 39th and Denison Ave. was grabbed by a man and taken to an abandoned home. The man attempted to rob the child, but the 12-year-old was carrying nothing but school supplies. The child was again able to break free from the man and make a run for it. The suspect in both crimes was described similarly, police said. Anyone with information regarding this matter has been asked to call detectives at 216-623-5218. All criminal activity should still be reported to 911. Photo from Shutterstock",1
1528,"A DeKalb man sentenced to life without parole earlier this month for robbing the Dollar General on Thornton Road and kidnapping one of its employees in 2014. Adam Montrell Gober was sentenced by Superior Court Judge William H. Beau McClain Feb. 12 following a jury trial where he was convicted of two counts of armed robbery, one count of kidnapping, two counts of aggravated assault, and two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Assistant District Attorney David Emadi requested the defendant be sentenced to life without parole while the defendant pled for mercy from the court during sentencing. McClain agreed with the States recommendation and sentenced the defendant to life in prison without parole plus an additional 30 years to serve. On May 13, 2014, defendant Adam Gober and his co-defendant Rodriquez Walker left their Decatur studio where they were ingesting various drugs and drove into Douglas County, exiting off of Interstate 20 at Thornton Road. They entered the Dollar General on Thornton Road at approximately 8 p.m. and were seen on video surveillance recordings casing the store and asking employees questions about when the store closed and how many employees were typically on the floor. Just before 10 p.m. both Defendants re-entered the Dollar General, and Gober was the last person in line checking out as the store closed. As the defendant placed a case of Coke Zero on the register, he pulled a gun out and pointed it at the cashier and demanded she and the night manager turn over all the cash from the tills and the safe, all while repeatedly threatening to kill the victims if they did not comply. At the conclusion of the armed robbery as they exited the store to leave a patrol deputy was seen patrolling nearby, and Gober told the assistant cashier she could leave, but that the 19 year old night manager had to come with him. He transported her at gunpoint and put her in his vehicle where his co-defendant and lookout was waiting. After placing the 19-year-old victim in the drivers seat of his vehicle, he told her to drive and get onto I-20 and head back towards Atlanta. The victim testified at trial that she knew if she got on the Interstate she would end up dead, so she decided to turn into the Burger King just before the I-20 off-ramp so there would be video if he killed her. After turning into the Burger King, the victim pled for her life and begged to be let go. Walker also urged Gober to let the victim go, fearing if they didnt let her go then, that Gober would end up killing her. Ultimately the victim was allowed to exit the car and she fled on foot back across Thornton Road toward the Dollar General where law enforcement was on scene having been alerted by the cashiers 911 call of the robbery. The defendants fled the area and drove back to Decatur. Days after the robbery, law enforcement received a break in the case when Walker posted a photograph of himself on social media wearing the same shirt he was seen wearing at the Dollar General the night of the robbery. After subpoenas were sent for those Instagram records, Investigator Trent Wilson and Captain Jamie Harrell identified and located both defendants in the DeKalb County jail. Law enforcement searched Gobers vehicle and property at the DeKalb County jail and they recovered the hat and shoes Gober was seen wearing during the armed robbery. Both victims were able to immediately identify Gober in separate photographic lineups as the gunman. Prior to trial, co-defendant Rodriquez Walker pled guilty as the lookout and getaway driver of the robbery and agreed to provide truthful testimony. Following a nearly week long jury trial, the jury convicted Gober of all counts after less than 50 minutes of deliberation. During sentencing Emadi reiterated to the court how close the case came to becoming a homicide, arguing that but for defendant Walkers pleas for Gober to release the victim, the victim very likely would have been murdered based on Gobers violent behavior that night and his multiple death threats towards the victim. Also introduced during sentencing was Gobers extensive criminal record which included felony convictions for attempted armed robbery with a deadly weapon in Las Vegas, robbery by force in Clayton County, residential burglary in Clayton County, along with four other felony convictions. Emadi called Gober, A menace to society who has shown by his actions in this case, and by his consistently violent behavior since becoming an adult over the past decade, that unless he is behind bars he will continue to be a threat to the safety and well-being of anyone he may come into contact with no matter where he goes. McClain agreed and sentenced the defendant to the maximum sentence allowed under the law, saying, I have a responsibility to protect the community at large from you. This sentence ensures you will spend the rest of your natural life in prison. The case was prosecuted by Assistant District Attorneys David Emadi and Joe Cusack.

1529,"A Brockton man charged with assaulting and kidnapping a woman in Brockton was ordered held without bail. Nathaniel Simmons, 49, was ordered by a Taunton District Court judge to be held over the weekend. He is scheduled to have a dangerousness hearing Monday, according to the Taunton Gazette. Simmons faces charges of kidnapping, assault and battery, assault, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, failure to stop for police, and negligent operation. Last Wednesday, police responded to several calls for a disturbance at Walmart on Route 138. Witnesses told police that a man, identified as Simmons, assaulted a woman in the parking lot and fled in a Ford Taurus. When police found the vehicle on King Philip Street, Simmons allegedly refused to stop and sped away. Simmons crashed his car on Route 104 after rear-ending a vehicle stopped at a stop sign. The victim told police she didnt know Simmons and he approached her while she was standing in front of a convenience store near the Brockton Police Department. She told police that she asked Simmons for spare change and he offered $50 to smoke crack cocaine with him and let him watch her touch herself. Simmons then allegedly put a fur-lined leather hat over her and went to an apartment before returning to the car. The victim said Simmons threatened and assaulted her during the day, and was scared that he would shoot her if she tried to run away. While in the Walmart parking lot, the victim yelled for help and when witnesses responded, Simmons drove away. Simmons, a Level 3 sex offender, has faced rape charges in the past. In 1996, he was convicted of rape and in 1999, he was convicted of two counts of rape and one count of indecent assault and battery on a person 14 or older. Image via Raynham Police Department",1
1530,"By Bay City News Service: Two men were ordered Friday to stand trial for the murder of an accomplice in a shootout that erupted during a San Mateo home invasion robbery last year, prosecutors said. The robbery happened on Sept. 4, 2013, when three suspects went to a home in the 1500 block of Lodi Avenue at about 11:30 p.m. and confronted four people inside the home, police and prosecutors said. The suspects demanded the resident open his safe at gunpoint but the resident refused, pulled a gun and started shooting at the suspects, authorities said. The robbers returned fire and in the gunfight, two robbers and the resident were wounded. The robbers dragged their accomplice, who was suffering multiple gunshot wounds, out of the residence to their SUV parked outside. They then went to a hospital, authorities said. That accomplice, identified as 23-year-old Bryant Ma of San Jose, was pronounced dead there. Edwin Lee, 22, was treated for gunshot wounds and arrested. Police also arrested 23-year-old Bunn Vo at the hospital. The resident injured in the gunfire was found at his home by police and treated for gunshot wounds not considered life-threatening. Lee and Vo were charged with murder for Mas death under Californias provocative act doctrine, which allows defendants to be charged with murder if they create a situation that leads to a death, regardless if they are directly responsible. They were also charged with burglary, robbery and kidnapping and Vo was charged with attempted murder, prosecutors said. San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Mark Forcum on Friday afternoon ordered both to stand trial on all charges, prosecutors said. They are next scheduled to appear in court on Oct. 1 and remain in custody without bail. (Image Via Shutterstock)",1
1531,"A convicted sex offender testified Monday that he had no intention of trying to abduct a 12-year-old girl in Temecula, telling jurors that he had too much to lose and would never have risked his freedom by snatching a child off of the street. I did not try to tell her to get into my car, Robert Francis Baker told jurors as he rested his case following a two-week trial that could see him returned to prison for the rest of his life if hes convicted. I had no chloroform, no mask, no gun -- nothing you need for a kidnapping. Theres no evidence that I tried to abduct the victim. I wouldnt do anything that could ruin what Ive worked so hard for all my life, he said. Baker is charged with attempted kidnapping to commit rape, attempted lewd acts on a child, annoyance of a child by a registered sex offender and two counts of being in possession of child porn. The 69-year-old defendant is acting as his own attorney and spent 90 minutes testifying on his own behalf, often rambling about his relationships with women, his casino winnings, singing career, failing health and efforts to see to the needs to his now-98-year-old mother, with whom he resided in Hemet. Riverside County Superior Court Judge Michael Donner repeatedly cautioned Baker not to give a closing statement, as he would have an opportunity to do that at the end of the trial. The defendant choked and wept on several occasions, particularly when he pondered not being able to care for his mother in her final days. I have to take care of my mom, he told the jury. She comes first. Im an only child. Baker, who spent a decade in state prison for molesting an 11-year-old girl in San Diego County, testified that after his release in 2005, he was never once late to a meeting with his parole officer and has made it a habit over the last 12 years to avoid general contact with minors. The former charter boat captain said he had no blemish on his record and no run-ins with law enforcement until last Aug. 12, when he was arrested for allegedly harassing the victim, identified in court documents only as J.M. I didnt have any time to do anything inappropriate to her, Baker said. Why would I offer some 12-year-old girl money to come with me? The defendant reiterated part of his opening statement, insisting that he was trying to locate a Temecula dentist on Pauba Road for a $6,000 dental procedure when he encountered the youngster. Baker said he was disoriented, unfamiliar with the area, and pulled over to ask the girl for directions. He admitted asking her twice whether she wanted a ride, even though she told him no the first time because her parents had warned her not to accept rides from strangers. Baker also acknowledged flashing a wad of cash at her, but said that he was trying to pull out his drivers license to put her at ease, and the cash and card were bound together by a rubber band. I was two seconds from pulling away, and in comes a hand and badge, telling me to turn off the car, the defendant said, referring to his detention by District Attorneys Office Investigator Ron McGowan. According to Deputy District Attorney Ed Jensen, McGowan was in the area on business and witnessed the alleged interaction between Baker and the girl while driving by. Jensen said the investigator stopped and asked the girl whether she knew Baker, and when she didnt, Ron intervened and detained the defendant. Sheriffs deputies were summoned and initiated an investigation, during which they found multiple vibrators, condoms and lubricants in Bakers rented vehicle, according to Jensen. He also alleged that a search of the defendants Hemet home resulted in the seizure of several laptop computers loaded with child pornography. Baker was convicted in 1993 of multiple counts of lewd acts on a minor. Hes being held in lieu of $1.5 million bail at the Southwest Detention Center in Murrieta. – By City News Service / Image via Riverside County Sheriffs Department",1

1535,"By ALEXANDER NGUYEN (Patch Staff) The last of the three young men from wealthy Bay Area families is seeking his freedom after nearly 40 years behind bars for kidnapping a busload of Chowchilla schoolchildren in 1976 and buried them in a quarry in Livermore for ransom. Frederick Newhall Woods, 64, along with friends James and Richard Schoenfeld were convicted in the kidnapping in 1977. Woods is now the only one behind bars. Richard Schoenfeld was released by the parole board in 2012 and James was pardoned by Gov. Jerry Brown in August. Previous: The friends were in their early to mid-20s when they ambushed a busload of schoolchildren from Dairyland Union School in Chowchilla, a small farm community about 85 miles west of Gilroy, on July 15, 1976, according to prosecutors. The men left the bus camouflaged in a creek bed and drove the children and bus driver Ed Ray about 100 miles to the California Rock and Gravel Quarry in Livermore, a quarry owned by Woods father. They then sealed their victims in a large van that had been buried in a cave at the quarry and fitted to keep the children and driver hostage, prosecutors said. The kidnappers, all from wealthy families in the Peninsula communities of Atherton and Portola Valley, then demanded a $5 million ransom for the schoolchildren and Ray. The hostages escaped from the buried van a little more than a day after they were first kidnapped when Ray and the two oldest children piled mattresses to the top of the van and forced their way out. Previous: The Schoenfeld brothers and Woods received life sentences after pleading guilty in Alameda County Superior Court in 1977 to 27 counts of kidnapping for ransom. But an appellate court ruled in 1980 that they were eligible for parole, finding that the victims didnt suffer any bodily harm. Woods, who has spent the last 39 years behind bars, has a parole hearing set for Nov. 19. Supporters of Woods release include a congresswoman and a retired state appellate judge, according to the Associated Press. They argue that he has paid his debt to society and should be released. The Alameda County District Attorneys has opposed parole for the Woods and the other two defendants and until recently Board of Parole Hearings had denied parole requests for the convicted kidnappers. --Bay City News Service contributed to this report.",1
1536,"A 22-year-old Riverside man was charged today with attempting to sexually assault a woman jogging in a Laguna Niguel park. Sean Luke Salaber, who was arrested Thursday night, is charged with attempted kidnapping to commit a sex offense and assault with intent to commit a sex offense, both felonies, as well as brandishing a replica gun, a misdemeanor. Salaber, whos being held in lieu of $100,000 bail, listed his occupation as National Guardsman in jail records. He is ex-military, but its not immediately clear which branch he served in, according to Orange County sheriffs Lt. Jeff Hallock. The woman, whose name was withheld, was attacked in a portion of Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park that is in unincorporated county land near Laguna Niguel about 6:40 p.m. Thursday. She said she was running on the trails when her attacker tackled her from behind and held a weapon to her head and groped her, Hallock said. Investigators later recovered the weapon, which was an air gun, he said. As the woman shouted for help, her attacker held the air gun to her head, Hallock said. At some point, the suspect was scared off by a bystander responding to the shouts for help, he said. Salaber was arrested about a quarter-mile from the park near Kite Hill Drive and Becard Drive, Hallock said. His booking mug shot resembled a sketch of a suspect wanted for sexual assaults, including one involving a 14-year-old girl in Riverside, but investigators later determined there was no link, Hallock said.

The calls were made by unidentified persons who claimed to be holding the residents friends or relatives hostage and threatening that harm may come to them if they dont send cash, said Lt. Keith Golding, police spokesman. The calls were received by two separate residents within the past week, each from a male caller using bogus phone numbers. As of this time, the numbers and sources of the calls has been difficult to trace, but the police continue to investigate. The victims in both incidents were able to verify their loved ones were fine and the calls were bogus. Image via Shutterstock",0
1545,"Editors note: . Since that time, several persons have come forward with more information they feel can be helpful to the case, including potential suspects, possible vehicles used and other information, which has been shared with Allegheny County homicide detectives. The identity of the woman interviewed for this story is being withheld for her safety. The woman stood alone at about 8:30 a.m. on Nov. 23, 1977, at a Port Authority Transit stop in Wilkinsburg, waiting for the bus that would take her to her job in downtown Pittsburgh. The 24-year-old grew up in Wilkinsburg, and she and her husband had purchased a property on nearby Rebecca Avenue, which they were remodeling. The bus stop was close by on Ardmore Boulevard. As she waited in the chilly November air, a motorist pulled his car off the street, partially into an alley and onto the paved area of an auto repair garage—right next to her. To the best of my recollection, the woman said, during an interview last week, ... he made a suggestion I did not appreciate. Something about the man instinctually heightened the womans sense of danger. When she threatened to call the police, he made a U-turn on Ardmore Boulevard and headed back toward the Parkway East. In 1977, there werent personal cell phones—so carrying out her threat would have required making her way quickly to a nearby business, home or Johnston Elementary School, which was across the street. She did not report the incident to police after he left. But what the woman did do was to write down the red-and-white Ohio license plate number and note that he was driving a blue car. I didnt think about it anymore, she said. -------- About 2:15 p.m. that same day, 6-year-old Beth Lynn Barr left Johnston Elementary School on Franklin Avenue, which dismissed an hour early because of the holiday. She crossed the street with classmates and began the two-fifths of a mile walk alone to her Princeton Boulevard home, heading up Ardmore Boulevard in the direction of the WTAE-TV studios—past the bus stop where the man had approached the woman hours before. Beth turned left onto Marlboro Avenue, then immediately right onto Traymore Avenue. There, according to a witness, a man carried a schoolgirl fitting Beths description into a dull blue sedan with red-and-white license plates. That was the last time anyone saw her. Beths father, Charles, was a Wilkinsburg policeman. The police force sprang into action when she didnt come home from school. ------- That evening, Wilkinsburg police knocked on the womans Rebecca Avenue door as they canvassed the neighborhoods around the school. She shared the information about the man who had approached her that morning. Her description of the man and car pretty much matched that of the witness who saw Beth being carried to the car. Police described the suspect as a white male in his 40s, 5-feet-10 to 5-foot-11, medium build with medium brown, curly hair. He was wearing a gray suit and square, blue-tinted sunglasses. He would have reminded me of someone with an office job, the woman said, adding that he was possibly wearing a necktie. She also remembers he was not an attractive person. She was surprised that the police didnt contact her again about the encounter as the investigation continued. I never heard anymore about it, the woman said, noting it was more than a year later when they talked to her again. ------- Police thought they had found the car involved at Conleys Motor Inn (now the site of a Home Depot) on Business Route 22 in Wilkins Township. The vehicle belonged to a car rental agency based in the motel and, according to records, had not been signed out on the days surrounding the kidnapping. A search of the blue car with red-and-white Ohio plates turned up nothing. Police from , Wilkins and other local departments helped Wilkinsburg officers comb the woods behind Conleys, which yielded no clues. Neither did a search of the homes and woods in Wilkinsburg. On Dec. 10, 1977, there seemed to be a break in the case. Police arrested a McCandless Township salesman in connection with the kidnapping, but charges were dropped when he established an alibi that he had been in Johnstown that day. Both the salesman and his brother agreed to submit to lie detector tests. Lt. Robert Thomas, then officer in charge of the Wilkinsburg Police Department, said in 1979 that he was not positive that they ever took the tests or, if so, what the results showed. A psychic had been called in soon after the kidnapping, and some seven to nine others offered visions of Beths whereabouts, including water and grave markers. In March 1979, Joseph Leonard of Monroeville stumbled upon a partially exposed skeleton as he walked with his dog in the woods off Johnston Road in Monroeville, across from the part of Restland Memorial Cemetery where the duck pond is located. There was no doubt it was Beth. Though brush, dirt and leaves covered her skeleton, Beth remained dressed in the red pantsuit, blue tennis shoes and plaid coat she wore to school that November day. Thomas delivered the sad news to Donna and Charlie Barr, and their son James, at their Princeton Boulevard home exactly 16 months to the day, within the same hour that their daughter disappeared. The mounded grave appeared more piled than shoveled, former Monroeville police Detective Willis Greenaway said at the time. He noted, according to the crime lab, bodies sometimes surface following freeze-thaw conditions. An autopsy revealed Beth had been stabbed several times in the chest, according to then-Assistant Chief Deputy Coroner Anthony Pankowski. He said the condition of the skeleton was consistent with Beth being dead since the time of her disappearance. Pankowski also said that there was no way to determine if she had been sexually molested, though the lab was to run tests on her clothing. Some newspapers reported that the area adjacent to Restland Cemetery had been searched after Beths disappearance, but police officials at the time—Thomas; Harry Hodgins, who had been Wilkinsburgs chief in 1977; and former Monroeville Chief George Gregowich—concurred the area had never been searched. ------ The woman said police tracked her down at work and interviewed her a second time, which she recalls was around the time Beths body was found. I said to them, What ever happened? They explained about tracing the car back to the rental agency, which is about three miles driving distance from where Beth was eventually found. When the woman asked about the car, they told her the rental agency manager said it had never left the premises. I found that absolutely astounding, the woman said. Obviously, they found the car. But the investigation never went anywhere. Frankly, that was the last I ever heard from them. ----- Through the years, the woman has occasionally thought about the little girl who never made it home. Not long ago, she and an old friend talked about how they remembered going to see Walkin Rosie, a ghost said to haunt Restland Memorial Cemetery in Monroeville. The friend recalled that Beths body had been found adjacent to the cemetery —and that her killer had never been found. That same friend mentioned a cold case story about Beths murder that appeared in Gateway Star Newspapers in 2003. The woman looked it up online and found herself mentioned as the woman at the bus stop. But as she read further, something bothered her. The story noted that the day Beth was abducted, three newspapers in the former Dardanell Publications weekly chain—the Penn Hills Progress, Churchill Area Progress and Wilkinsburg Gazette—all carried a story about the one-year anniversary of the strangulation murder of Barbara Lewis of Penn Hills, whose body was found in a trash bin in the Blackridge Civic Association parking lot in Churchill. Lewis belongings had been found in a wooded area off Princeton Boulevard in Wilkinsburg, the street where Beth lived. And then came the sentence that hit a little too close to home for the woman—the one that said that Lewis, too, had been waiting at a bus stop on Long Road in Penn Hills on the morning she was murdered on Nov. 19, 1976. There were just too many coincidences, the woman said. Theres got to be a connection. In fact, there has been some speculation that Lewis murder was the last in a string of what is believed to be serial murders in western Pennsylvania between 1976 and 1977. And just a few weeks before Beth disappeared, two boys walking in the woods at Bradys Run Park found the skeletal remains of Stephanie Ann Boller of Beaver Falls, an apparent homicide victim—and there were some similarities between the cases. Some police believe that Beths abductor was likely a pedophile and that there might not have been a connection to the incident at the bus stop earlier in the day. In retrospect, the woman feels very fortunate that she was standing on the passenger side of the car that day, 34 years ago. She doesnt want to think what might have happened if shed been on the drivers side. That could have made a world of difference, the woman said. ----- Looking back, the woman thinks Wilkinsburg police botched the case by holding on to it so long before turning it over to Allegheny County police detectives and not accepting help from more experienced Pittsburgh police detectives. She isnt alone. A man, who identified himself as the son of a former Turtle Creek policeman, also contacted the author of this story after seeing an account of Beths murder. According to him, his father was at Kellers Hardware Store in Turtle Creek around the time of the kidnapping when a man walked in and bought a shovel and a few other items that raised the policemans suspicions. The son said his father called Wilkinsburg police with information, but that no one ever checked out the lead. Had the man who kidnapped Beth continued along Ardmore Boulevard, it is not out of the question that he might have been in Turtle Creek, taking the back roads to Monroeville. Allegheny County police Assistant Superintendent Jim Morton said the county has received a grant to review cold cases and that there are three boxes of reports from the Beth Barr case. He said cold cases are never closed. ----- Eight months after Beth was laid to rest at Woodlawn Cemetery in Wilkinsburg, the woman and her husband relocated to a distant city. I always wonder why I moved away from Wilkinsburg, she said. She might have answered that question several years ago when the city where she had lived for more than 20 years started to feel not so safe. Thats when the woman and her family moved again. Its a shame, the woman said, referring to the fact that Beths killer has never been found. I still dont believe its a lost cause. Someones going to come forward. Anyone with information about the murder of Beth Lynn Barr is asked to call the Allegheny County Police Homicide Division at 412-473-1300.

1546,"WORCESTER, MA—A man is facing charges after a domestic assault that involved punching a woman and slashing her with a knife in the face. Around 7:40 p.m. on Tuesday, April 17, multiple units responded to an apartment on Queen Street where a domestic assault was reported to be taking place. Officers got information that a 39-year-old man was holding his ex-girlfriend hostage at knife-point inside the kitchen and had possibly slashed the victims hand. Hostage negotiators responded to the scene and talked to the suspect, who released the victim. The woman had bruises on her arms and face and cuts on her arms, including a stab wound to the hand. She was taken to the hospital. The suspect was arrested. Police learned that the incident began earlier that day when the two were in a vehicle together, and the suspect allegedly assaulted her repeatedly and wouldnt allow her to get out, threatening her. The suspect then started to drive erratically and hit a telephone pole, said police, with the argument making its way into the Queen Street apartment. There, the suspect allegedly continued to punch and threaten the victim. Two other people inside the apartment at the time pleaded with him to stop, but he instead picked up a knife and swung it toward the victim, said police. The 39-year-old male of Worcester was charged with Assault and Battery, Assault to Murder, three counts of Assault and Battery with a Dangerous Weapon and kidnapping. Photo via Shutterstock",1
1547,"A former Camp Pendleton Marine who raped and sexually assaulted six women along El Cajon Boulevard over a five-year period was sentenced Friday to 97 years to life in state prison. Ted Amparan, 41, was convicted last year of rape, assault with intent to commit rape and kidnapping for rape. Deputy District Attorney Mary-Ellen Barrett said most of the victims were working as prostitutes, except one who was lost and coming from a party when Amparan approached her in his car. The prosecutor said the first victim was attacked in 2007, then four others in September 2010 and another in September 2011. She said Amparan attacked women who werent likely to report the crimes. This isnt one period of aberrant behavior, the prosecutor said in court today. He kept doing it. The fact that Amparan was in military uniform when he committed most of the sexual assaults was an aggravating factor in the case, Barrett said. She said Amparan would pick up prostitutes on El Cajon Boulevard, then drive them to a parking lot along Camino del Rio South in Mission Valley, where freeway noise made it difficult for anyone to hear their screams. Amparan told one victim, Go ahead and scream, nobody will hear you, the prosecutor told Judge Melinda Lasater. The woman who was coming from a party when she was targeted was also taken to the Mission Valley location, but was able to scale a six-foot-fence and run across a freeway to get to safety, according to the prosecutor.

Montgomery County Police have arrested Enrique Carbajal, 24, and Victor Tome, 19, both of the 11500 block of Elkin Street in Wheaton. Carbajal is also being investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department and the Alexandria Police Department in Virginia for assaulting the girl in their jurisdictions.

1551,"The rape and strangulation death of Brenda Lee Ritter, 18, of North Strabane Township on May 19, 1977 is a case that still haunts police. Her death occurred as the fourth in a series of slayings of young women in Washington County. The murders of Deborah Capiola, Mary Irene Gency and Susan Rush left county residents on edge. The death of Barbara Lewis in Penn Hills within the same time frame left investigators wondering if her strangulation death was at the hands of the same killer. According to a Sept. 28, 2003 story in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Brenda left her boyfriends home in Chartiers Township about 10:10 p.m. May 18, 1977 during a raging thunderstorm. Her boyfriend, Larry Bonazza, and his mother made sure the doors of Brendas Ford Pinto were locked because of the slayings—then watched her drive away. The slender blonde worked as a secretary for Kennedy and Carter, a Washington construction firm. Brendas abandoned car was found in neighboring South Strabane the next morning. Before a massive search got under way that afternoon, searchers in a state police helicopter spotted Brendas nearly nude remains on a hillside off rural Roupe Road, about three-quarters of a mile from her car. Her clothes were also found within about 50 feet of her body. South Strabane and North Strabane police received the help of 25 Pennsylvania state troopers in their investigation. As a result of those efforts, investigators determined that Brenda was raped, and then strangled using a tourniquet-type device made from her panties and a stick. Farrell Jackson, then Washington County coroner, said tests placed the time of death at between 11:30 p.m. and midnight. Some forensic evidence—including hair and fingerprints—was found in the car. At one point, a broken bracelet with the name Jack engraved on it, which was found in the vicinity of the murder, was considered as potential evidence. Tests run on Brenda to see if a drug was used in her abduction came back negative. Donald Zofchak, South Stabane police chief at the time, said an investigation determined Brenda had not taken her normal route home from the Meadow Lands, where the Bonazzas lived. At the time, there was some thought among investigators that perhaps someone posing as a police officer could have gained access to Brendas car without a fight. Her car appeared to have no damage. Jackson shared a profile of the killer shortly after Brendas murder, describing him as between 20 and 30, not unattractive but average in appearance; not too intelligent but smart enough to know his victims routes and follow them ... and began his sex life rather late and gets violent after the sex act. According to that profile, that man would likely be between 55 and 65 years old today. There was some hope of solving Brendas murder in 1983 when Henry Lee Lucas, a serial killer in Texas, admitted to killing women in 16 states. But he was never charged in Brendas death—nor in any of the murders of area young women during that era.",0
1552,"PROVIDENCE, RI—Two Connecticut bounty hunters wound up on the wrong side of the law and in custody after they captured a suspect inside Sixth District Court in Providence on Thursday. State police stopped their car on I-95 near Route 117 in Warwick and arrested them for kidnapping and conspiracy after a trooper working a courthouse security detail confirmed the bounty hunters should not have been operating in Rhode Island. Angel Guadalupe, 45, of Bristol, Conn.,, and William Sobota, 40, of Burlington, Conn., were each charged with kidnapping and conspiracy, according to Laura Meade Kirk, spokeswoman for the state police. Both were released on personal recognizance after an arraignment this afternoon in Providence. Their suspect was also released. Kirk said the bounty hunters found out a suspect had a court date in Providence on an unrelated charge. After he was arraigned, they stopped him and led him away, she said. The bounty hunters detained the suspect based on an outstanding warrant for failure to appear for misdemeanor crimes in Connecticut, she said. However, Rhode Island General Laws do not allow for out-of-state bounty hunters to operate in this state. The Trooper also confirmed there was no active arrest warrant for the suspect in Connecticut, so extraditing him was not an option.

1563,"Last summer, a disturbing call reached the Duke 1 Orange County Sheriffs Department helicopter crew as their shift was ending. A 4-year-old boy was reported missing from Santa Anas Jerome Park after attending a birthday party. The call came in on July 27: A 4-year-old boy reported missing at Santa Anas Jerome Park, OCSD said in recent release. The child in question had attended a birthday party. Like many of his friends, he was running on the playground. However, while the other children returned to their families, the 4-year-old was nowhere to be found. According to OCSD, their helicopter crew, Duke 1, had just finished a two-hour patrol flight and was making its final descent when the crew made the decision to self-dispatch, even though the call was routine in nature. A quick glance to the fuel gauge let pilot Santa Ana Police department, Corporal Jeff Van Es and OCSD Deputy Brian Stockbridge know they had about 30 minutes of flight time left, they said. As luck would have it, thirty minutes would be more than enough to distribute quick information and locate the missing boy. Using Dukes PA system, the crew repeated the childs name, what he was wearing and his physical description as they circled overhead. Citizens in the area stopped and listened. After about 15 minutes of searching and making announcements, residents starting calling dispatch to report a suspicious man in his 20s with a little boy matching the description, they said. The man was a few blocks from the park walking with the boy near a shopping center at McFadden Avenue and Sullivan Street. Callers reported the man was attempting to solicit money from passersby. Thanks to the alerts from Duke, citizens spotted the boy and questioned adult with him, who initially claimed to be his father, they said. The suspect became nervous and fled. A group of Good Samaritans kept the boy safe until authorities arrived. The Santa Ana Police Department arrested the suspect, and the man admitted to investigators he kidnapped the boy with the intent to sexually assault him, they said. The suspect was booked on suspicion of kidnapping for the purpose of lewd acts with a child and kidnapping.

1586,"NORTH SAN DIEGO COUNTY -- A violent parolee was shot by a Sheriffs deputy and taken into custody after he stabbed a police dog and threatened to kill a hostage at an apartment complex in Rancho Santa Fe on the morning of Dec. 3. Just before 5:30 a.m. on the day of the incident, deputies from the Sheriffs North Coastal Station responded to a report of a person yelling and the sounds of items breaking in front of 6012 Paseo Delicias in the community of Rancho Santa Fe. When deputies arrived a few minutes later, they said they were confronted by a white male adult about 50 to 55 years of age, who was standing in front of one of the apartments at that address and brandishing a knife. The suspect, say police, yelled at deputies that he was going to stab them. Police say that in an attempt to take the suspect into custody with the minimum amount of force, deputies launched pepper balls at the suspect and deployed Sheriffs K-9 officer Banjer. However, the pepper balls had no effect and suspect stabbed Banjer under the left eye. Deputies recovered Banjer and he was rushed to a local animal hospital for emergency surgery. The suspect then broke into a nearby apartment where he confronted the resident and held them at knifepoint for a short time. The resident was able to break free of the suspect and run into the bathroom and lock the door. The suspect then yelled to deputies who were outside, that he had just slit the throat of the victim. As deputies prepared to enter the apartment to rescue the victim, the suspect stepped outside and again confronted the deputies with the knife. One of the deputies fired four times, striking the suspect in the torso. Deputies took the suspect into custody and began to render first aid until paramedics could arrive.

1588,"A suspect was arrested in connection with the alleged sexual assault of a 13-year-old Thursday morning in Lawrence, according to the Essex County District Attorneys office. The man, 21-year-old Angel Mateo, will be arraigned Friday in Lawrence District Court on sexual assault charges, the DAs office said. Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera called the crime unspeakable. This crime is unspeakable and we have to do all possible to protect our most vulnerable citizens, he said in a statement. According to the Lawrence Police Department, the teenager is a local middle school student who reported she was grabbed from behind and forcibly carried to a nearby apartment, where she was repeatedly sexually assaulted. The victim told police she was held against her will for more than two hours before being released, at which point she reached the school and called her mother. Her mother then called police. Her description of the man and the apartment led officers to Mateo, who is facing charges of kidnapping and aggravated statutory rape. Rivera said in the statement no immediate or continuing threat to the public or school children exists. Rivera also said Mateo was on pre-trial probation, had an ankle bracelet, and lived near the school, but was not a sex offender. Here is the statement Rivera released Thursday evening: Patch will update this story.",1
1589,"State police are warning people that swatting, the act of calling in a false report in order to attract a large law enforcement response, is not only dangerous, but illegal. The most recent incident of swatting occurred on Sept. 22 in Colchester, according to a release from the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection. Members of state police and local police departments responded to a report of multiple shootings and a hostage situation at a Colchester residence. The home was vacant. Swatting drains police, fire and other public safety resources and is highly disruptive to businesses and schools The Colchester incident was evidence of a growing problem in Connecticut and across the country. These false calls for help are criminal acts that take our much-needed first responders away from critical duties and deplete scarce resources, said Dr. Dora B. Schriro, Commissioner of the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection. Keeping the public safe is our core commitment. We will investigate all swatting incidents and arrest those who commit this crime. Perhaps the most well-known incident of swatting in the state involved a call placed to police that warned of an impending mass shooting at Yale University last November. The call prompted a massive law enforcement response that shut down the downtown New Haven area for hours. The response cost the New Haven Police Department $30,000 in overtime alone. Police arrested Jeffrey Jones, 50, and charged him with falsely reporting an incident among other alleged crimes.",0
1590,"The reported abduction of a woman missing from Iowa who was found bound with duct tape in a motel room in Stratford turned out to be a false report that she was held against her will, according to police.

1591,"Almost as soon as 16-year-old Laura Miller was kidnapped and murdered in 1984, her case went cold. The League City teen probably ran away, police initially told her father, Tim Miller. She had a history of suicide attempts, they reminded the worried dad. He asked police: Could Lauras disappearance be connected to the murder of Heidi Fye, a waitress whose body was discovered in the desolate oil field off Interstate 45? Both were last seen at the same gas station, both used the same payphone, and they lived within three blocks of one another. Didnt it make sense to at least look at a serial killing? That added up to some big coincidences, even if circumstantially. Miller says police brushed all of it aside and dropped the investigation, dismissing his daughter as probably a runaway or suicide and Fye as probably a drug addict. Miller decided if he was going to catch his daughters killer, he would have to do it himself. Now, nearly 35 years later, he may have done that. Along the journey, Miller has helped identify the remains of some 200 people through the nonprofit mounted search and recovery he founded after his daughters disappearance from League City, located in north Galveston County, Texas, on Sept. 10, 1984. She was using the payphone to call her boyfriend. The Miller family was new to town and their phone hadnt been hooked up yet. Miller, now 71, was correct about his hunch that Laura might have been killed in the rugged wasteland between the oil fields and I-45 that has become synonymous with missing women and girls. A couple of years after Laura disappeared, boys riding their dirt bikes on the rough terrain of the area smelled something foul and discovered a womans body propped to a tree. That led investigators to Lauras skeleton. Both womens bodies had been dumped in the same area where Fyes body was found. From the 1970s to the 2000s, the bodies of 30 women and girls have been discovered in what came to be known among locals as the killing fields and later, as the as the Texas Killing Fields, the title of a 2011 movie starring Sam Worthington that is loosely based on the cases of missing girls between Galveston and Houston. A few of the oil field murders have been solved, but Laura Millers case went cold — except for the dogged refusal to give up by her father, and the help of his Texas EquuSearch Mounted Search and Recovery team. Miller told The Guardian he believes the killer may be Clyde Hedrick, who is serving a 20-year sentence in a Texas prison for the murder of a woman in 1984, the same year Laura was killed. Hedrick was long suspected of killing Ellen Beesen, whose body was found near the oil fields, but wasnt arrested for her murder until 2013. Hedrick originally claimed Beeson had drowned while they were skinny-dipping together, and he panicked and hid her body. The autopsy was inconclusive, and Hedrick was convicted of abusing Beesons corpse and served a short stint in jail. Almost three decades later, a new examination of Beesons body showed she died of blunt force trauma to the head, leading to Hedricks arrest and eventual conviction. Hedrick has denied any involvement in the deaths of Laura Miller, Heidi Fye and a woman identified as Jane Doe, whose bodies were all found in the oil fields around the same time. All three bodies had been ritualistically propped against a tree with their faces pointed toward the sky. A fourth body was later discovered face down. Investigators have said they have two different suspects. The League City Police Department hasnt named Hedrick a suspect or person of interest in either case. Miller and the local police department have had an acrimonious relationship, and he has accused police of incompetence and botching the investigation. Patch has reached out to the League City Police Department for comment, and well update this post if we hear back. Miller has said his daughters boyfriend can connect Hedrick to Laura. Before the Millers moved to League City, he was a neighbor and sometimes talked with Laura when she walked by. Given the crowd the troubled teen was running with at the time of her death, she could certainly have had more than a passing acquaintance with Hedrick, Miller told The Houston Press three years ago. The boyfriend told Miller Laura and some of her friends went to Hedricks house to buy pot, according to The Guardians report. As prosecutors were building a case against Hedrick in Beesons murder, several women they interviewed implicated him in the oil field murders. The witnesses included a woman who said she was with Hedrick when he dumped Beesons body, kicking it to ensure she was dead. She eventually led investigators to Beesons body, despite Hedrick allegedly having threatened to kill her and her children if she went to police. Even if police werent, Miller was convinced enough of Hedricks involvement that he named him as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in 2015, shortly after Hedrick was convicted in Beesons death. Gary Ratliff, who is still the League City Police Departments assistant chief, said at the time that he told Miller that he is not helping our criminal case at all. I can tell you that Tim Miller wasnt there the day that these bodies were discovered, was not present at the time when evidence was collected, Ratliff said in 2015. So its hard to take anything that he says with relevance when I know that he is a grieving father that is still grasping to make amends to get this cleared up — as we are. For his part, Hedrick said Miller has a crusade against him and that hes the latest in a string of people he has accused in the past. Miller got a lot of people to think Im the League City Killing Field Serial Killer, Hedrick told The Guardian. Im the fourth man he said got to be the one. All of us caused his daughters death. Come on. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",1

1597,"A man who tried to kidnap a 7-year-old girl outside a Solana Beach school two years ago pleaded guilty Thursday to kidnapping and assault with intent to commit molest. Jack Henry Doshay, 24, a member of an affluent Fairbanks Ranch family, will be sentenced to 10 years and four months in state prison on May 31. He will also be required to register as a sex offender for life. Doshay was arrested on April 1, 2015, in connection with the kidnapping at Skyline Elementary in Solana Beach nine days earlier. Prosecutors said Doshays DNA was found on duct tape wrapped around the victims head before he tried to carry her off. Staff members heard the girls screams and she was able to escape. Doshay subsequently was charged in a 10-count indictment with child molest counts involving a September 2010 crime in which he allegedly lured a 5-year-old girl behind a shed after school at Santa Fe Elementary and tried to remove her pants. The girl screamed, kicked her attacker and got away, said Deputy District Attorney Ryan Saunders. A judge dismissed two lewd act charges in that case after Doshays attorneys successfully argued that prosecutors failed to present evidence to a grand jury that pointed to someone other than Doshay being involved in the 2010 incident. As a result of the plea agreement, all other charges were dismissed. Doshays father, Glenn, is a minority shareholder of the San Diego Padres. The defendant is free on $5 million bail pending sentencing. By City News Service / Image via Shutterstock",1

1601,"The father of a teen accused of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a Palos Hills woman says his son has an alibi on the day the alleged assault took place in September and his boy is the subject of a police racial witch hunt. The 17-year-old boy, who is still in high school, appeared before Cook County Judge Peter Felice on Class X felony charges of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated criminal sexual assault with a weapon and armed robbery. Juveniles who are 15 to 17 years old accused of violent crimes are automatically charged as adults, the prosecutor said. The teen is alleged to have kidnapped a woman as she parked her car around 5 p.m. Sept. 9 in front of her home in the 10000 block of South Walnut Terrace, Palos Hills. The prosecutor said the teen entered the back of the womans vehicle then held a 9 mm Glock to her head. Making verbal threats and using the gun to instruct her where to drive, he made the woman drive them to a secluded area near 99th Street and 84th Avenue. Before the sexual assault began, he asked the woman if she had any napkins, the prosecutor said. According to the charges, the teen used the womans shirt to sit on and told her not to touch his penis. He then forced her into giving him oral sex with the gun close by. After fifteen minutes or so, he instructed her to drive him to a grassy area. The prosecutor said the teen told the woman he was taking her purse but he would leave her keys outside the car. When she was sure he was gone, she found her keys and drove to a gas station for help. Asking to borrow the businesss phone, the woman called a family member and then the police. I believe this is a case of mistaken identity, Edwards said. The description of the suspect does not even fit my client. Judge Felice set bail at $300,000. The high schooler, who turns 18 later this month, is due back in court Dec. 15 in Bridgeview. After the bond hearing, the youths father said that Palos Hills police trashed his house early Wednesday morning in the 9900 block of South 82nd Court, Palos Hills. The father said his son was home alone, and he was at work when police came knocking. Police allegedly recovered a wallet and purse belonging to one of the victims. The boys father accused police of engaging in a racial witch hunt. From the way the detective was talking to us, he knows that my son doesnt fit the profile but might have an idea the kid is, the father said. [The police] have an idea who the kid is and that my kid knows who he is. The father said that his son was playing in a baseball game in Joliet during the time frame of the alleged sexual assault. The teens attorney said he hasnt seen the Palos Hills police reports or have knowledge of any other physical evidence. The state didnt mention semen, skin or hair, therefore, I have to believe [the police] have it, the teens attorney said. My client is a good student and son. His family absolutely believes hes innocent. We recovered a purse from the victim of the sexual assault along with DNA evidence, parts of her clothing that he had made her take off, Palos Hills Police Chief Paul Madigan told reporters earlier Thursday. Police believe the high schooler may be tied to other similar crimes that happened in the area, including another woman who was grabbed at gunpoint from the same location in Palos Hills on Aug. 20. The woman was made to drive to a secluded spot where she was robbed of her purse and cell phone, reports said. The high schooler is also under investigation for two separate incidents that occurred within minutes of each other in Hickory Hills on Sept. 13 — an attempted carjacking and an aggravated kidnapping.

1606,"A state grand jury late Wednesday declined to file any criminal charges against a New Jersey state trooper who fired at a car occupied by three teens during an incident at the troopers home last July.  After hearing testimony and evidence from the investigation, a state grand jury declined to indict Trooper Kissinger Barreau of Sparta on any criminal charges, according to a release from the state Attorney Generals Office. Read more: LISTEN: Teens 911 Call After Being Shot At By Off-Duty State Trooper The shooting was investigated by the Attorney Generals Shooting Response Team, made up of attorneys and detectives from the Division of Criminal Justice and detectives from the State Police Major Crime Unit. Here were some of the reasons for the lack of indictment, as well as some of the details of the incident that the Attorney Generals Office considered, according to the release:  An officer may use deadly force in New Jersey when the officer reasonably believes it is immediately necessary to protect the officer or another person from imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm, according to the release. The incident began at approximately 1:50 a.m. on July 26, 2015, at the troopers house on Whispering Woods Lane in Sparta, where he lives with his wife and three young children. Both Barreau and his wife stated to investigators that the trooper was awakened by his wife after she heard banging noises coming from a rear sliding door and was concerned that someone was attempting to break into the home, according to the release. The trooper armed himself with an off duty-firearm – a .40 caliber handgun with a laser sight – and went to investigate. Barreau said he confirmed that there appeared to be individuals at both the back sliding door, where he saw pulling movement and heard punching noises. At the front door of his residence, there also was loud punching on the door and jiggling of the doorknob. The trooper said he believed that persons were trying to break in, according to the release. Neighborhood residents had been concerned about a number of burglaries in the area in recent months. Barreau said he had a verbal exchange with an individual at the front door, during which he identified himself as a state trooper, yelling What do you want here? and Get off my property! He stated that one of the individuals outside said a name. It turned out to be the correct name of one of the teens, according to the release.  The trooper stated that he exited his residence and chased the individuals toward the street in front of his house. The individuals got into a car and drove north on Whispering Woods Lane toward a cul-de-sac, according to the release. According to the troopers statement, he positioned himself in the middle of Whispering Woods Lane facing the cul-de-sac and waited for the car to return. Barreau then observed the car traveling south on Whispering Woods Lane toward him. The trooper said he had his handgun out and yelled for the driver to stop, identifying himself as State Police. According to the trooper, the car accelerated as it approached him and began to veer toward him. He stated that he feared for his life because he believed that the driver was going to run him over. Barreau stated that he fired three shots at the driver of the vehicle while moving to his left to get out of the way of the car. The car continued on Whispering Woods Lane and the driver ultimately stopped on a nearby roadway because one of the cars tires had been struck by one of the troopers shots. The trooper went into his house to put on shoes and get his car keys, and he told his wife to call 911, according to the release. Barreau got into his SUV and went looking for the teens, but he instead encountered an Ogdensberg police officer who had responded to a police radio bulletin about a possible break-in at the troopers home. The officer returned with the trooper to his home, according to the release.  Ballistics evidence presented to the grand jury revealed that one bullet struck the front tire of the car on the passenger side, and a second bullet struck the front edge of the rear wheel well on that side.  The three young men in the car - Jonathan Baker, Jesse Barkhorn and Matthew Mayer - were interviewed separately by the Shooting Response Team and gave statements that were consistent in many respects with the troopers statement. They differed in some respects, however, according to the release. All said they did not hear the trooper identify himself as a police officer at any time. They stated that they did not know that the man with the gun was a member of law enforcement. All three also said that the driver did not steer toward the trooper, but instead steered to avoid him. However, all three said that the trooper might reasonably have believed that the car was going to hit him. Two of the men were 18 at the time, and one was 19, according to the release. Each of the three teens told investigators that they had been at a graduation party on the night in question, and they went to Whispering Woods Lane because one of the teens – the one who identified himself by name to the trooper at the front door – wanted to visit a male friend who lives next door to the trooper. According to their statements, once the three teens reached the neighborhood, they were met by several acquaintances who said that they had just left the home of the friend and that the friend was going to sleep. The three teens stated that they accidentally went to the home of the trooper, believing it was the friends house, and were attempting to wake the friend by banging on the doors. The teen who had the friend in the neighborhood said that he was intoxicated at the time from drinking beer and that it was dark on the street, according to the release. When they heard the trooper yelling at them from inside the house, they became frightened and fled, according to their statements. They said the trooper was cursing and yelling Get out of here! The teen whose friend lives next door said the trooper said Who is this? One teen responded with his correct name, as verified by the troopers statement.  According to the statements of the three teens, they ran to the car, turned on the car lights and drove toward the cul-de-sac. As they turned around and drove back toward the house, they saw the trooper standing in the middle of the road with a gun. Two of the teens said that they saw the red laser sight on the gun pointing toward the car. The driver and at least one of the other teens indicated that they were afraid and accelerated when they saw the trooper with the gun in the street. But all three indicated that they did not want to hit the trooper and that the driver maneuvered to avoid him, according to the release. The driver and one passenger stated specifically that they went to the left side of the road to avoid the trooper as he moved to the right. All three teens, however, stated that, because the trooper was standing in the middle of the road, he might have believed that the car was going to hit him. The teens continued to flee after the shots were fired, according to the release.  According to the teens, they drove to a nearby street before the disabled tire caused them to stop. At that point, the driver called his mother to report that a man with a gun had fired at them. He also called his brother and a friend, and then called 911 to report the shooting, according to the release. Two of the teens were taken into custody by police where the car had stopped. The third, who had identified himself at the troopers door, ran away before police arrived and was taken into custody later as he came out of a wooded area.  The grand jury was instructed as to potential criminal charges against the trooper – including attempted murder, the various types of aggravated assault, and simple assault – and the legal elements to prove each crime, as well as the law of justification, particularly the use of force in defense of self and others. A law enforcement officer may use deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to thwart the commission of certain crimes – namely homicide, kidnapping, sexual assault, or burglary of a dwelling, or an attempt to commit one of those crimes, according to the release. After considering the facts, evidence and testimony from the investigation by the Attorney Generals Shooting Response Team, the grand jury declined to return an indictment.",0
1607,"(Editors note: This is from the Lakewood Police Department regarding last weekends hostage situation at Washington State Employees Credit Union) On August 25th, at approximately 1154 hours, Lakewood Police Officers were dispatched to the Washington State Employees Credit Union for a report of a man with a gun holding 12 people hostage inside. Officers were on scene immediately and surrounded the building. A crisis negotiator attempted multiple times to establish communication with the suspect but he would not acknowledge the negotiator. After approximately 45 minutes, the suspect walked into the glass enclosed foyer with a female victim and was still visibly armed with a handgun. Fearing for the safety of the female victim and the hostages, officers shot and disabled the suspect. Officers then closed in on the suspect and secured the premises. The suspect was transported to Tacoma General Hospital in critical condition.  The suspect is still at the hospital under 24/7 police guard duty and could be there for 1-2 more weeks.  He will be booked into the Pierce County Jail when he is released. The suspect is a 47-year-old male from Tacoma named Arnold Briones Flores. He and the primary female victim were married for over 26 years and were recently separated with a history of Domestic Violence. Initial indications are that they met at the Credit Union to resolve financial matters and the suspect attacked the victim once inside.  The suspect initially attacked and stabbed the victim with a knife prior to pulling out the handgun.  The gun used by the suspect turned out to be a very realistic looking .177 caliber BB gun (see attached picture).  The female victims wounds were not life threatening. The officers that fired their weapons that day were Officer Joseph Kolp and Officer Paul Osness.  Officer Kolp is 47 years old and has been in law enforcement for 13 ½ years.  Officer Kolp previously worked for the Pierce County Sheriffs Department and came to Lakewood PD in August 2004.  Officer Kolp is a past member of the Metro Swat Team.  Officer Osness is 44 years old and has been in law enforcement for 8 ½ years.  Officer Osness previously worked for the Pierce County Sheriffs Department and came to Lakewood PD in August 2004.  Officer Osness is currently a defensive tactics instructor and a firearms instructor.  Both officers have been placed on paid administrative leave while the investigation is being conducted.  This is a normal procedure for officers involved in on-duty shootings.

1613,"Police say two elementary school-age brothers from Chicago fabricated an elaborate story of being drugged and abducted in order to cover up their efforts to skip school Tuesday and spend the day in Skokie and Niles, the Skokie Review reports. The brothers — one in third grade, the other in sixth — confessed to making up the kidnapping saga to Chicago and Skokie police, who questioned them for about a half hour after finding them at an office building near the Skokie-Niles border, the report added. They did a good job with it, Chicago police Sgt. Mark Golosinski told the Review, calling the boys tall tale imaginative. So what was the fiction the brothers created in an attempted to hide their day of hooky? Heres what Golosinski told the Review about how their story unfolded: On their way to school, the brothers said they were shot with tranquilizers, which knocked them out. They then were loaded into a van and driven to an office building in the 5500 block of West Touhy Avenue in Skokie, where they were found by police. But what really happened on the brothers unsanctioned day off? According to Golosinski, the boys walked to the Barnes & Noble bookstore at the Skokie Village Crossing shopping center and then crossed the street to the Niles Walmart, the Review reports. Eventually, the boys ended up at the Touhy Avenue office building, where an employee at one of the businesses there noticed them, the report stated. The police were contacted, and the kidnapping story was devised and told, the report added. Authorities said the brothers — who dont have a history of skipping school and are considered good students — wont face criminal penalties stemming from their deception, the report stated.

Moamen Abdelmeguid, 18, and his 16-year-old accomplice, both of Marlboro, were arrested Thursday, Howell Detective Sgt. Christian Antunez said. Police are not releasing the 16-year-olds name due to his age, Antunez said. Abdelmeguid and the 16-year-old came to the Windmill Club development in Howell about 6:30 p.m. on Thursday to buy drugs from Joseph Arnold, 19, of Howell, Antunez said.

The victim told police the suspects grabbed the victim in a choke hold and forced him into the back of their car against his will, Antunez said. They then threatened to shoot the victim if he didnt turn Arnold over to them, he said. Despite the victims insistence that he did not know Arnold, Abdelmeguid and the 16-year-old drove the victim around the neighborhood for about five minutes, looking for Arnold, Antunez said. Abdelmeguid and the 16-year-old returned to the victims house and forced the victim to allow them into his home to search for Arnold, who they never located, Antunez said.

1623,"A 68-year-old convicted sex offender accused of trying to coax a 12-year-old Temecula girl into his car must stand trial for attempted kidnapping to commit rape and other charges, a judge ruled Monday. Robert Francis Baker of Hemet was arrested in August after he was allegedly caught in the act of harassing the victim, whose name was not disclosed. Following a preliminary hearing at the Southwest Justice Center in Murrieta, Riverside County Superior Court Judge Dennis McConaghy found there was sufficient evidence to warrant a trial for Baker on the attempted kidnapping count, as well as annoying a child and two counts of possessing child pornography. McConaghy scheduled a post-preliminary hearing arraignment for Dec. 27 and left Bakers bail set at $1.5 million. Baker is being held at the Southwest Detention Center. According to sheriffs officials, on the afternoon of Aug. 12, an off-duty DAs investigator, was driving through the area of Pauba Road and Linfield Way when he noticed a motorist — later identified as Baker — accosting the victim as she walked along the sidewalk. Baker allegedly followed the girl, trying to persuade her to get into his car, investigators said. The off-duty investigator came to the childs aid, ordering Baker out of the vehicle and detaining him until sheriffs deputies arrived to question him. Based on the girls statements, what the investigator witnessed and the fact that Baker was a registered sex offender, he was arrested at the scene.

Bedford Police Chief Robert Bongiorno and Carlisle Police Chief John C. Fisher Saturday are praising the swift and accurate work of police dispatchers and police officers from both communities who worked together to apprehend a carjacking suspect. Shortly before 10 a.m. Saturday, officers responded to Northside Convenience on North Road for a report of a carjacking and kidnapping. When officers arrived, they spoke with a man who told police he had stopped at the gas station with his wife. He went inside the store, while his wife remained in their Ford Ranger pickup truck. When he came outside, he witnessed his vehicle being driven away with his wife inside. The vehicle proceeded down Rte. 225 toward Carlisle. Bedford Police Emergency Communications Officers, working at the police station, immediately relayed information about the vehicle over an areawide radio network. Police in neighboring Carlisle were included in the transmission, and Carlisle Police Sgt. Scott Barnes quickly found the vehicle and was able to conduct a traffic stop. Bedford officers arrived minutes later. Officers arrested Michael Sullivan, 35, of Quincy without further incident, and the woman in the vehicle was unharmed. Sullivan was taken to the Bedford Police Station for processing and was charged with Carjacking. Chief Bongiorno praised the readiness and teamwork shown by police and communications officers. We are very fortunate in Bedford to have one of the lowest rates of crime in the Commonwealth, but that only underscores the importance of training and preparation by all members of the Bedford Police Department, and that showed today, Chief Bongiorno said in a statement issued Saturday. I am equally proud of the teamwork and partnerships established by our department with our neighboring communities. Chief Fisher praised his officers, especially Sgt. Barnes, who stopped the vehicle. During a crime in progress, minutes and seconds can make a tremendous difference, Chief Fisher said in the same statement. Sgt. Barnes was in the right position to take immediate action to end this situation without harm coming to anyone involved. Sullivan is being held on $10,000 cash bail pending his arraignment Monday in Concord District Court.",1

1631,"A Bristow man will not serve any further prison time for a 2011 Haymarket home invasion. Andrew Stuart Myers, 22, received consecutive five-year suspended sentences on each charge for abduction and burglary in Prince William County Circuit Court Nov. 1. He also received five years supervised probation. Defense attorney David Daugherty argued that while Myers admitted involvement in the crime—he pleaded guilty in June in exchange for reduced charges—he had intervened when the incident turned violent. The defense further painted a picture of a young man who had never been committed any type of crime before. You would expect someone involved in this type of offense to have a lengthy, violent criminal record, said Daugherty. That is not the case. Police reports and court records outline much of what occurred on Dec. 20, 2011, at a home on Myradale Way in Haymarket. Myers and Steven Hall, of Manassas Park, entered an acquaintances home through an unlocked door. They then tied up the mother of the acquaintance and screamed at her to be calm, according to a witness statement. They said that they were there for money and jewelery. In another room, Hall began to beat the witness, whose face was left bloody and bruised, Halls case file shows. Myers attorney argued at the court date that his client had pulled Hall off the victim; the prosecution did not dispute that claim. Assistant Commonwealths Attorney Richard Conway said that Myers had helped tape up the mother in her own home, the area where she should feel most safe. Anyone who engaged in the type of conduct this defendant did should be sentenced to an active term, Conway said. The judge told Myers his decision was an opportunity for me to show you some mercy—but warned Myers not to get in any more trouble or he would serve 10 years in prison. Sentencing for Steven Hall—who has also pleaded guilty to reduced charges—was pushed to March 7, 2013, to allow a defense expert witness to testify, according to court documents.",1

Two of the defendants were arrested in Montgomery County for their alleged involvement in a brutal stabbing of a man whose body was found in Wheaton Regional Park in September. Montgomery County Police arrested Miguel Lopez Abrego in November and Albaro Rosa Moreno in December for the murder of a man at Wheaton Regional Park. The unknown victims body was found in a grave in Wheaton Regional Park Sept. 5. There was trauma to the body and the Medical Examiners office in Baltimore ruled the manner of death a homicide by sharp force injuries. Police said the victim was stabbed over 100 times. Abrego and Moreno were among the two dozen defendants charged with conspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise in the indictment recently unsealed in the U.S. District Court in Baltimore. The six-count indictment alleges that from 2015 and continuing through 2017, MS-13 members and associates engaged in racketeering activity that included murders, conspiracies to commit murder, attempted murders, extortion, robbery, kidnapping, drug trafficking and money laundering, prosecutors said. We will not allow MS-13 and its members or their affiliates to bring their nefarious and deadly activities into our neighborhoods, Acting Special Agent in Charge Cardell T. Morant of the FBI said in a statement. I am proud of the dedicated agents who have duly executed their duties in our collective pursuit of law, order and justice. SEE ALSO: The indictment says the defendants allegedly murdered five people in Frederick, Anne Arundel and Montgomery Counties. Three of the victims were dismembered, prosecutors said. In addition, the defendants allegedly conspired to murder eight individuals, maiming and assaulting one of the individuals with a machete, shooting one individual in the head, and kidnapping and threatening another individual with a firearm to extract payment for extortion, the indictment said. Those charged in the indictment are: The names of six other defendants charged in the racketeering conspiracy remain sealed. MS-13 is ravaging communities throughout the United States with brutal violence, recruiting children to their murderous ranks, destroying families, and leaving behind countless victims, Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan said in a statement. This indictment — which charges two dozen alleged MS-13 members with senseless acts of violence — is the latest example of the Department of Justices unwavering commitment to combatting violent gangs that prey on communities, whether in Maryland or elsewhere in our country. The maximum sentence for the racketeering conspiracy is 20 years in prison, or up to life if special circumstances are proven; a maximum of 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering; and a maximum of 20 years in prison for money laundering conspiracy.

1640,"Charges wont be filed against a police officer for fatally shooting a man who killed a hostage last year in South San Jose, according to the Santa Clara County District Attorneys Office. A 38-page report from the office released today indicated Sgt. Justin Moro was lawful in firing a weapon at 45-year-old Leonel Acevedo on Nov. 9, 2015, prosecutors said. There is no question that the situation Acevedo created carried such an imminent threat of death or great bodily injury to Sergeant Moros fellow officers and the only reasonable action available to him was to fire his weapon at Acevedo, Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Theresa McLaughlin said in her report. Moro, a sniper who has worked for 15 years with the Police Department, was one of the officers who responded to a report of weapons and a hostage situation at a home in the 4400 block of Camden Avenue around 2:15 p.m. that day, McLaughlin said. Acevedo, a former resident of the home, forced his way inside by pretending to sell his car to a resident and then fired multiple shots. He took another woman, 53-year-old Yolanda Najera, as a hostage while the other resident initially contacted was able to escape and call police, McLaughlin said. Acevedo called Najeras husband to insult him and challenged him to come to the home, according to McLaughlin. Acevedo then stepped out of the home and fired at officers, one of whom was injured in the leg and later found a bullet lodged in the heel of his boot. Moro fired back twice with a rifle roughly 60 yards away from the home, but the suspect remained standing and managed to duck for cover, McLaughlin said. The sergeant released a third shot that struck Acevedo, who officers found with two weapons, one of which was still in his hand that held the trigger, according to McLaughlin. The suspect also had a bag with 29 bullets in the back pocket of his jeans, McLaughlin said. After Acevedo was killed, officers found the hostage, Najera, dead from multiple gunshot wounds in a hallway in her home, McLaughlin said. An autopsy from the Santa Clara County medical examiners office showed Acevedo was hit in the shoulder, chest and lower back from the three shots Moro had fired, according to McLaughlin. The suspects landlords discovered a note in his bedroom that asked them to call his relatives if he didnt return home, McLaughlin said. The district attorneys office investigates all officer-involved incidents that result in death. Officers can use deadly means of force if they are faced with danger, prosecutors said. --Bay City News/File photo",1

According to an FBI affidavit filed with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Chebbi picked up his two children Nov. 11 for a weekend visit as part of an Oct. 26 custody order from the Circuit Court for Prince Georges County — the same court that granted the divorce of Faical Chebbi and Édeanna Johnson-Chebbi in January 2011. Johnson-Chebbi said she received a phone call from her ex-husband Nov. 12, during which he said, This is the worst phone call of your life. I have the kids, were in Tunisia, Before being taken to Tunisia, the children attended schools in Oakton — Eslam, now 6, at  and Zainab, now 3, at , both on Hunter Mill Road. Theyve been in Tunisia since November, when their father, Chebbi, violated U.S. custody orders prohibiting him from taking them out of the country. Chebbi was able to obtain Tunisian birth certificates and passports for his two children through the Tunisian Embassy, said Johnson-Chebbi, a Fairfax resident who has accused Tunisian officials of enabling the kidnapping. According to the FBI, Chebbi speaks Arabic, English and French, and may travel out of Tunisia to Algeria, Libya, Egypt and France. To cross borders illegally, he may use an alias, which the FBI lists as Facial Ben Abdallah Chebbi. What our investigation has revealed is that Chebbi is a good manipulator of people, Special Agent Jeff Johannes said in an FBI podcast Wednesday. Johnson-Chebbi has been battling for custody through the Tunisian court system since January. She returned to court Tuesday for a ruling, but it has not yet been released. Johnson-Chebbi told supporters on her Facebook page, Return US Home, she expected a ruling within the next few days. Earlier this year, the Eastern District of Virginia charged Faical Chebbi with international parental kidnapping. Chebbi has also been listed on the wanted list for Interpol, the worlds largest international police organization. Thank you to the FBI, and a very tremendous special agent, who has stepped up their efforts to see Eslam and Zainab home!

1647,"Peter Aleksandrov Magnis, age 27, of Hydes, Maryland, pleaded guilty today to a robbery conspiracy in connection with the robbery of a jewelry store, including a carjacking and kidnapping, according to an announcement to the United States Attorneys Office, District of Maryland. The guilty plea was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein; Special Agent in Charge Kevin Perkins of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; Chief James W. Johnson of the Baltimore County Police Department; and Baltimore County States Attorney Scott Shellenberger. According to his plea agreement, Magnis was part of a conspiracy to rob a Pikesville jewelry store. Specifically, in the fall of 2012, a co-conspirator devised a plan to commit an armed robbery of a jewelry store, known to be owned and operated by members of the Russian community of Northwest Baltimore. The co-conspirator recruited Magnis, Grigoriy Zilberman and others to participate in the robbery. Prior to the robbery, the conspirators gathered intelligence, including conducting surveillance and attaching a GPS device to the car of an employee of the jewelry store in order to learn the employees travel routine and habits. Zilberman also exploited his friendship with the employee to obtain information about the operation of the jewelry store and the habits of the employee. According to Magnis plea agreement, on January 15, 2013, Zilberman enticed the employee to visit his home, in order to alert the other co-conspirators of the employees whereabouts. Early in the morning on January 16, 2013, as the employee was driving from Zilbermans home, four co-conspirators used a law enforcement-type light bar and a loudspeaker to impersonate a police officer and pull over the employee. Brandishing firearms, the co-conspirators removed the employee from his car, bound and blindfolded the employee, put him into the trunk of his own car, and drove him to a predetermined location. According to the plea agreement, once at the location, Magnis co-conspirators continued to brandish firearms and threatened to kill the employees family if he did not comply with their demands or if he reported the incident to police. The employee complied and at approximately 3:52 a.m., two co-conspirators drove the employees vehicle from the remote location to the jewelry store, while other co-conspirators stayed with the employee. Additional co-conspirators were stationed near the jewelry store to act as look-outs. The two co-conspirators entered the jewelry store and stole jewelry, stones, and watches, valued at about $500,000. The 2 co-conspirators drove back to the remote location, where the employee was placed back into the trunk of his car and driven to another location, where he was left. The employee was able to kick his way out of the trunk through the back seat of his car. On January 18, 2013, one of the conspirators sold a portion of the stolen jewelry for approximately $29,000 to an FBI informant. On January 19, 2013, the conspirator traveled to Brooklyn, New York to sell some of the jewelry and stones taken during the robbery, receiving over $100,000. On January 21, 2013, the conspirator returned to Maryland and divided the cash proceeds among the members of the conspiracy and others. On November 19, 2014, during the search of Magnis residence and the adjacent property, a bag of guns was found buried on the adjacent property within 20 feet of Magnis property. Inside the bag were six firearms (all rifles and shotguns), each individually wrapped in clear plastic wrap. Two of the firearms were sawed off shotguns, and one of these had an obliterated serial number. Both of those guns were stolen during an armed home invasion of residence in Reisterstown, Maryland, on July 22, 2012. In addition, in January and May 2013 Magnis purchased three handguns. One of those handguns was seized during a car stop and search of a co-conspirator in September 2013. The co-conspirator was prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms due to a previous felony conviction. Magnis faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for the robbery conspiracy. U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz has scheduled sentencing for December 22, 2015, at 10:30 a.m. Grigoriy (Greg) Zilberman, age 24, of Owings Mills, Maryland, previously pleaded guilty to his role in the robbery conspiracy and is scheduled to be sentenced on December 18, 2015. United States Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein praised the FBI, Baltimore County Police Department, and Baltimore County States Attorneys Office for their work in the investigation. Mr. Rosenstein thanked Assistant United States Attorney Paul E. Budlow and Aaron S. J. Zelinsky, who are prosecuting the case, according to an announcement to the United States Attorneys Office, District of Maryland.",1

1656,"The smell of death emanated from two heavy duffle bags stained red that accused murderer Lloyd Lee Welch had a cousin help him burn in 1975. Residents of Taylor Mountain, VA, tell investigators that the fire burned for days and smelled like a cremation. What prosecutors must now prove to a Bedford County, Virginia, jury is that the bodies of sisters Sheila Lyon, 12, and Katherine Lyon, 10, were in those bags. The girls were last seen walking home from a mall in March 1975. On July 10, indictments were handed down by a Bedford County, VA, grand jury that charged Lloyd Lee Michael Welch Jr., 58, with first-degree felony murder in both sisters deaths. Welch is a convicted sex offender incarcerated in a Delaware prison. Smell of Death According to affidavits just unsealed in the case, a relative of Lloyd Welch told police that in the spring of 1975 he came by unexpectedly with a duffle bag of bloody clothes that he wanted the relative to launder, reports WUSA. A cousin, Henry Parker, also told detectives he helped Lloyd Welch burn two 60- to 70-pound duffle bags stained red and smelling of decay, reports The Washington Post citing a search warrant. The bags smelled like death, Parker said in court documents. Parker told the Post in a phone interview that he didnt know what was in the bags that were burned. He told the newspaper he didnt see the Lyon sisters. Other family members warned Parker to stay away from Lloyd Welch, saying: Hes trouble. Hes trouble all the way around. In May, investigators served a search warrant at the home of his uncle, Richard Allen Welch Sr., in the 4700 block of Baltimore Avenue in Hyattsville. He was previously named a person of interest in the case of the two girls and has denied any wrongdoing. Pursuing All Leads Prosecutors said at a Wednesday press conference that the charge filed against Lloyd Welch includes the allegation that during his abduction of the sisters with the intent to defile them, he killed the girls. John McCarthy, the states attorney from Montgomery County, at a press conference Thursday, pledged to continue to pursue anyone who harmed the girls, and those who have lied and misled investigators. Authorities said the investigation continues in Maryland and Virginia, and other charges are possible. While investigators have not found the girls bodies, that search continues. Life was never the same for any parent who tried to raise a child after the disappearance of these little girls. Weve never forgotten the Lyon family or the Lyon girls, McCarthy said. Capt. Darren Franke, head of the Major Crimes Unit of the Montgomery County Police, said that Parker, Richard Welch, his daughter, Patricia Welch, and others will be investigated further. I believe theres someone out there that knows a lot more than theyve shared so far, Franke said. I believe theyre waiting for the right reason to come forward. Authorities on Thursday noted that many residents testified in grand jury proceedings in Bedford County, which resulted in Welchs indictment. But their work isnt done. We will be relentless in finding the facts of this case, Franke said. Look at your conscience, remember back then, remember now as this conspiracy goes on. Call us, were listening. If people have a lead, they can call (434) 534-9521 or email cybertip@ncmec.org. In February, investigators said they believed the girls were taken by the convicted sex offender and later sexually assaulted by his uncle, according to court documents. The information was contained in search warrants executed as Montgomery County Police, the FBI and sheriffs deputies searched for traces of the sisters on Taylors Mountain in Bedford County, VA. The area is the one-time home for both Welch men, authorities said, and two searches of the region have been done. Timeline of Girls Disappearance The girls walked to Wheaton Plaza (now Westfield Wheaton Mall) on March 25, 1975, but never returned home, Patch previously reported. The Washington Post cited documents that say Lloyd Welch told detectives he took the girls when he left the mall the day they disappeared, and that he later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the sisters. Our department and our partners in Virginia remain committed to determining what happened to Katherine and Sheila Lyon, said Montgomery Police Chief J. Thomas Manger in February 2015. We believe that there are people, including family members of Dick and Lloyd Welch, who have information that would further this investigation. Police named Lloyd Welch a person of interest in connection with the kidnapping of the Lyon sisters in February 2014. Welch, who was charged with sex offenses against girls in several states, has been in a Delaware prison since 1997, according to police. Montgomery County Police said that Welch was noticed paying attention to the sisters the afternoon they disappeared. His uncle was named a second person of interest in the abductions in October 2014. The elder Welch was a security guard in the Wheaton area during the time of the sisters disappearance, Patch previously reported. Investigators believe Richard Welch owned property at Taylors Mountain in the Thaxton area of Bedford County, WJLA TV reports. Montgomery County Assistant Police Chief Russ Hamill Hamill said previously he thinks theres a good chance the girls are on the mountain. In an earlier letter to the Post, Lloyd Welch denied any involvement in the disappearance of the sisters. Richard Welchs daughter told the newspaper the allegations are a lie. Anyone with information about the case is asked to call Montgomery County Police at 240-773-5070. »Photo of Lyon sisters from Montgomery County Police Earlier Patch Coverage:",1

He then approached a Brecksville police officer and asked where he could find the 101 bus, adding that he did not know whether the 101 was a Summit Metro or Cleveland RTA line. The officer replied that it sounded like a Metro line and offered to drive him to a hotel on Richfield Road where there was a Metro stop and the man agreed. Meanwhile, the officer got the mans name and checked it in the police database. There he found that the Cuyahoga County Sheriffs Office had issued a warrant for the mans arrest. He is accused of violating his probation after he was convicted of attempted abduction last year in Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Consequently, instead of dropping him off at the bus station, the police officer arrested the man on the warrant. The officer noted in his report that the man cooperated during the arrest and allowed himself to be checked for weapons.",0
1661,"- In a case that brought campus sexual assault to the spotlight at Colorado University-Denver, a Hawaii man was sentenced to nine years in prison Wednesday for the sexual assault and kidnapping of an unconscious college student at CU-Ds Aurora campus on Halloween night, 2015. John D. Kennedy, 23, was convicted in June of this year, after a jury found him guilty of second-degree kidnapping, sexually assaulting a physically helpless victim who could not consent and unlawful sexual contact, the Denver Co. District Attys office said. Kennedy and the victim were students at the Auraria campus, when the victim blacked out in the early morning of Nov. 1 after too much Halloween celebrating, police reports said. Friends moved her into an apartment for safety, but Kennedy waited until others had left a common hallway and then carried her into his own apartment, where he raped her while she was still unconscious. A friend later discovered the victim missing, and discovered Kennedy, with the victim in his apartment. The victim was unaware she had been moved, or that she had been sexually assaulted, and had never consented to sex, according to the DAs statement. Video surveillance footage the next day showed Kennedy conveying the victim down the hallway, at which point she notified police and went to Denver Health for a sex assault examination. Kennedy confessed to the rape, which was confirmed with witness testimonials and DNA evidence. I commend the victim and witnesses for their courage and determination throughout this lengthy case, Denver District Attorney Beth McCann said, in a statement. Todays sentence sends the message that campus sexual assault is not business as usual and that this is a serious criminal act. Image: John D. Kennedy. Courtesy: Denver Co. District Atty.",1

The gunman was identified in published reports as Xang Khang, 26, of Sacramento. --- Sacramento police sharpshooters fatally shot a robbery suspect who allegedy took two employees hostage at a Jack in the Box restaurant, it was reported Sunday. Hundreds of Saturday afternoon customers watched the three-hour standoff, according to the The Sacramento Bee. Two women, both restaurant employees, escaped unharmed from the eatery in the 8300 block of Folsom Boulevard in the College Greens Shopping Center, the newspapers online website reported. Paramedics took the wounded man to a local hospital, where he later died. We tried for several hours for this to end peacefully, Sacramento police information Officer Doug Morse told the Bee. Its very unfortunate it had to end this way. It was a very tense, really frightening situation for everyone involved. Dan Escamilla had just sat down to lunch at El Festival taqueria behind the Jack in the Box about 12:30 p.m. A bail agent from Orange County, he was visiting the area in search of a violent felony fugitive, the Bee reported. An employee from Jack in the Box rushed into the taqueria and said the nearby restaurant was being robbed, Escamilla said. The (woman) came into the restaurant yelling, Theres a guy with a gun and hes inside the Jack in the Box right now, Escamilla said. So I ran and got my gun and my (protective) vest (from the car) to see if there was something that I could do to help. Just as he reached the back entrance to the Jack in the Box, a second woman – another restaurant employee – ran out and told him the robber had put a gun into her mouth, the Bee reported. I told her to get out of there quick, Escamilla said. The bail agent told the newspaper that he watched the back door until police arrived about two minutes later. Meanwhile, the gunman – described by police as a young Asian male – barricaded himself inside. Dozens of Sacramento police officers and Sacramento County sheriffs deputies gathered at the scene, the area quickly cordoned off with hundreds of yards of yellow tape. Folsom Boulevard was closed to all traffic between Howe Avenue and Florin-Perkins Road, the newspapers website reported. Police SWAT officers and hostage negotiators responded, setting up their command post behind the Chase Bank branch; a helicopter circled overhead, according to the Bee. As the hostage situation unfolded, area businesses stayed open and shoppers went to and from their vehicles, even as onlookers gathered along the tape barriers to take cellphone snapshots of the officers at work, the newspaper reported. We thought there was an accident or something, said Courtney Fea, who was grocery shopping with her father, Thomas. Then we saw all the police tape. About 2:45 p.m., one of the women was released and escorted away by officers. The crowd along the yellow tape barricades grew bigger as people watched officers unload a SWAT robot to survey the front of the restaurant. At 3:43 p.m., police fired shots and detonated three concussion grenades. The booming noise caused car alarms to go off in the parking lot, the newspaper reported. Immediately after the volleys, the remaining hostage ran from the restaurant and was met by several officers who rushed her to safety behind the building, according to the Bee. The safety of those inside the restaurant – as well as the community surrounding the restaurant – was just paramount, and officers were forced to take action to end this safely, Morse told the newspapers reporter.",1

1665,"A Hollywood man convicted of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a 14-year-old boy in the San Fernando Valley more than 16 years ago is facing a potential 35-year-to-life prison term, a prosecutor said Friday. Mirek Paul Voyt, who was arrested at his home last year, remains behind bars while awaiting a Feb. 14 sentencing hearing at the San Fernando courthouse. Jurors deliberated about 2 1/2 hours before finding the 55-year-old defendant guilty late Thursday of two felony counts -- one count of kidnapping to commit oral copulation and/or sodomy and one count of forcible oral copulation, according to Deputy District Attorney Julie Kramer. The jury also found true allegations of personal use of a firearm, aggravated kidnapping and tying and binding the victim, according to the prosecutor. He was arrested last February after being linked through DNA evidence to the June 22, 2001, attack in Northridge, according to Los Angeles police Capt. William Hayes. The teen was walking with another boy about 9:45 a.m. on June 22, 2001, near the intersection of Chase Street and Vanalden Avenue when a man armed with a handgun confronted them, Hayes said. One of the boys managed to flee, but the other was kidnapped and sexually assaulted before he was released, the captain said. Voyt lived within a short distance of the intersection where the abduction occurred, and investigators said he took the boy to his home after abducting him and blindfolding him. At the time of his arrest, Voyt was working in a management position for a grocery store chain, and since 2001 has lived in various locations in the Los Angeles area, the captain said.

1669,"- After claiming that hes innocent and storming out of court, an ex-convict was sentenced Friday to 159 years to life in state prison for sexually assaulting two young women and one minor girl in Oakland last year. Albert Rich, 35, was convicted last month of human trafficking of a minor for commercial purposes, rape, sodomy, kidnapping, torture and assault with a deadly weapon for sexually assaulting the victims and forcing them to work as prostitutes every day on International Boulevard until they finally were able to escape and get help from Oakland police. Before he was sentenced, Rich, a 6-foot-6, 320-pound man, who was guarded by several bailiffs, said, Everything in this case is a lie. I didnt do none of these things and I cant say I feel bad for them (the victims). While Alameda County Superior Court Judge Trina Thompson was pronouncing her sentence against him, a lengthy process because he was convicted of 13 felony counts and multiple enhancements, Rich got up from his seat and went out a side door leading to a stairway to a courthouse holding cell. Several bailiffs chased after him to restrain him. After Rich was convicted last month, prosecutor Sabrina Farrell said the three victims went through a lot when Rich abused them both physically and sexually and called his trial one of the most horrendous cases in recent Alameda County history. The crimes occurred in May and June of 2017. Farrell said Rich burned one of the young women with a flat iron hair-styling device and then sodomized her with a deodorant spray can, causing her to bleed for 12 hours. In a letter to the court Farrell read aloud, that victim said she met Rich through the website Plenty of Fish and said he presented himself as a generous and caring person who wanted to help me, and I thought he wanted to be my friend. But the woman said a short time later Rich took her to an apartment complex where he raped her in a stairwell, saying she couldnt stop him because he was so much bigger than she was. The victim said, I realized that he wanted to use me to get money by sleeping with other men, and I felt I really didnt have a choice. The woman said it took her eight months to recover from the 3rd and 4th-degree burns she suffered when Rich burned her with the flat iron device, and shes still traumatized by her experiences and needs to take medication in order to sleep. Richs lawyer Ernie Castillo told jurors during the trial that the three young women werent credible witnesses. Castillo said, Each of these girls did prostitution on their own and made their own decisions to work with Mr. Rich. Castillo admitted Rich, whos been convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, false imprisonment and illegal gun possession, is a pimp but said hes not a human trafficker and he didnt force them into the prostitution life. A second defendant, Sasha Coleman, 28, stood trial with Rich on charges of human trafficking and pimping for allegedly helping him with his human trafficking scheme, but the prosecution dismissed the charges against her during the trial. A third defendant, Khalilah Barker, 23, was also scheduled to stand trial for allegedly helping Rich, but on March 29 she pleaded no contest to three counts of human trafficking and two counts of pimping in a deal with prosecutors that calls for her to get a light prison sentence in return for her testimony against Rich. --Bay City News/Photo via Shutterstock",1

Wilson, as well as a family vehicle (a white 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt), were also reported missing. The incident prompted a statewide alert that the boy had been possibly abducted by Wilson.

1676,"- A transient accused of raping a homeless woman who was targeted while sleeping on a bus bench in Glendale was charged today with a series of felonies. Michael Zinzun, 48, a registered sex offender, faces a possible life prison term if convicted of the charges, according to the District Attorneys Office. He is expected to be arraigned this afternoon in Glendale on charges of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by foreign object, kidnapping to commit rape and resisting arrest. A witness called 911 about 4 a.m. Sept. 29 to report a sexual assault in progress in the 300 block of Los Feliz Road, according to Glendale police Sgt. Robert William. Officers arrived on scene within minutes and located both the suspect and the female victim, who was still lying on the ground half nude and with visible injuries, William said. The suspect attempted to flee from officers but was taken into custody after a short foot pursuit. Zinzun fought with police taking him into custody, and an officer sustained minor injuries, the sergeant said. The 56-year-old victim was sleeping on a bus bench near the intersection of Los Feliz Road and Central Avenue and woke up when the suspect approached and tried to start a conversation, police said. After a short period of time, the suspect began sexually assaulting the victim and threatening to harm the victim if she did not stop screaming, William alleged. The suspect then dragged the victim away from the bus bench and pushed her over to the other side of a small retaining wall where they were hidden from public view. The suspect then raped and sexually assaulted the victim, the sergeant alleged. During this time, the victim also sustained trauma to her face due to repeatedly being punched by the suspect. A witness who observed the attack called 911. Zinzun is a registered sex offender based out of the city of Pasadena and his original offense occurred in Florida, according to William. Prosecutors said Zinzun was convicted in Florida of sexual assault in 1998 and burglary in 2005.

1701,"A retired Navy veteran was arrested Wednesday for the kidnapping of Ashanti Billie, the Prince Georges County native whose body was found in North Carolina after she was missing from Virginia Beach for nearly two weeks this past September. Eric Brian Brown, 45, allegedly abducted Billie on Sept. 18 as she arrived for work at the Blimpies restaurant on Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek in Norfolk, Virginia, federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia said. Billie, who was a student at The Art Institute of Virginia Beach, never showed up for work Sept. 18 and was reported missing. Her body was found 11 days later and more than 300 miles away in Charlotte, North Carolina. Prosectors said Browns DNA was found on Billies body. His DNA was taken from a swab of the pocket openings of Billies hooded sweatshirt and a swab of the outside, back center torso area of her shirt. Brown allegedly flirted with Billie at Blimpies on several occasions. A witness also recalled hearing a conversation where Brown made a crude sexual comment to Billie, who was a 2016 graduate from Henry Wise High School in Upper Marlboro. Her remains were located in a wooded area behind a church on Greirs Grove Road Sept. 29, about 300 yards from Browns childhood home, prosecutors said.

He is believed to be homeless and lives at random facilities and buildings on and off the naval bases, prosecutors said. According to court documents, a review of Browns phones web history shows that Brown made numerous searches on Sept. 19, including police looking for man, Norfolk police looking for man in connection with homicide, amber alert sept 2017, missing woman and baby, and missing woman and man. Billies phone was recovered in a dumpster near the corner of Tallyho Terrace and Azalea Garden Road in Norfolk, about three miles from where she was last seen, Sept. 18.

Jones The report came to police around 2 p.m. Wednesday afternoon and started a full on search with helicopters and multiple officers involved.  As of 1:00 a.m. Thursday morning, the boy has only been identified as Boss, and no parents or guardians have filed a missing child report.  This has led APD to scale back, the search for Boss, according to local TV news reports. According to reports, 2 playmates at the complex playground made the initial claim that a man asked them if they wanted candy and this boy responded yes before being pulled into a car.  Parents are concerned because, they have heard of a similar incident in recent days of a white man with tattoos who has tried to entice children with candy in the neighborhood. According to the TV report the police have identified 2 children in the neighborhood that have known nicknames of Boss, and both are accounted for.

1711,"Three men have been arrested after engaging in lurid online discussions with an undercover cop who they believed was a child. The suspects ultimately planned to meet the child for sex in Montgomery County, the District Attorneys Office announced Tuesday. Donovan Early, 28, of Philadelphia, Joseph Picchi, 49 of Hammonton, New Jersey, and Jonathan Uitto, 30, of Conshohocken each made separate overtures to the child, who was really a cop posing as a 14-year-old girl. The suspects all shared sexually explicit photos with the girl, cops said, and discussed in detail their sexual plans. During the conversations, both over text and email, the undercover cop repeatedly told each man that she was only 14, according to the criminal complaints. Early agreed to meet the underaged girl on Jan. 17 in Conshohocken. Police met him at the agreed-upon place and took him into custody, charging him with statutory sexual assault, attempted involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, and related counts. Picchi also arrived at the meeting point in Conshohocken on Jan. 25 and was arrested on charges of statutory sexual assault, kidnapping, and related counts. Uitto did not come to meet the girl but was arrested on Feb. 14, police said.

1712,"Update, 3:44 p.m. Search warrants have been executed at Knights Inn off Brook Hollow Parkway, the hotel where Raymundo Aranda-Parra and Griselda Cibrian were, and 2193 Marshes Glenn Drive, where Aranda-Parra was renting a room. Update, 2:30 p.m. Raymundo Aranda-Parra has been charged with interference with custody and statutory rape, according to Norcross Police. He is being transferred from the Norcross Police Department to the Gwinnett County Detention Center where he will be held without bond. -------- Norcross Police say Griselda Cibrian, the 14-year-old from Glennville who was reported missing Sunday afternoon and found in Norcross on Monday morning, went voluntarily with 24-year-old Raymundo Aranda-Parra, and it was not an abduction. The investigation so far has indicated that Cibrian and Aranda-Parra have had an online relationship for seven months, Sgt. Bill Grogan of Norcross PD said during a press conference. The Sunday incident was their third time meeting in person. Aranda-Parra picked up Cibrian in Glennville and took her to his residence in the city of Norcoss, according to Grogan. Police did not disclose the exact location because they expect to execute search warrants over the next few hours, but he is renting the home. He then took her to a hotel, possibly two hotels, police said. While at the Knights Inn at 5122 Brook Hollow Parkway, she made a phone call to her parents saying that she wanted to go home. Norcross Police were notified around 8:20 a.m., and she was found in the hotel. Aranda-Parra was not in the hotel room, but he was found about an hour later. Both are still at the Norcross Police Department being questioned as part of the investigation, and both are being cooperative, according to Grogan. Even though this incident started in Glennville, Norcross Police say they are the department to issue any charges if there are any. Without a doubt, well be charging him with interference with custody, at a minimum, Grogan said, adding that Aranda-Parra knew that she was reported missing. Grogan could not discuss any other possible charges that police may be considering. Police are still investigating many aspects of the case, too, such as how Aranda-Parra was able to pick up Cibrian and bring her to Norcross, and why she changed her mind about staying with him in the hotel. Glendale Police is coordinating to get someone to the Norcross Police Department to pick her up after shes done being questioned by Norcross. After Aranda-Parra is finished with questioning, he will probably be taken to Gwinnett County Jail, according to Grogan. Police say the vehicle Aranda-Parra took, a black 2003 Chevrolet Silverado, was actually not stolen but borrowed from his employer in the construction business. Aranda-Parra and Cibrian apparently met through the website MocoSpace.com, a social networking site. She had told him she was 19 and he told her he was 24, said Grogan.

1719,"The key witness in a Bay Area police sexual exploitation scandal who prosecutors need to come back to California to file charges against seven current and former law enforcement officers has been released from a Florida jail. California attorneys Pamela Price and Charles Bonner announced in a statement that the 19-year-old woman known as Celeste Guap pleaded no contest to misdemeanor simple battery today. While they did not immediately disclose the conditions of the plea deal, they said it contained a stipulation that she would not have a criminal record. Price stood by the just-released Guap at a news conference in Florida later today announcing their intention to return to California, where the officers involved are expected to be prosecuted, and Price said she would file a lawsuit against an undisclosed number of officers. Price addressed Guap by her legal name, Jasmine Abuslin. Celeste Guap is dead, Price said. Celeste Guap is a woman whose name and picture has been blasted over the news with Kardashian-like celebrity status but Jasmine is a young woman who is going to find herself and has dreams of becoming a veterinarian, Price said. Jasmine is glad to be free and wants to go home, Price said. She said they have arranged for her to get medical treatment at Stanford University when they return. Abuslin went to a Florida rehabilitation facility last month with the assistance of the Richmond Police Department but was swiftly arrested for allegedly assaulting a guard and was jailed for the last 17 days on $300,000 bail, rankling Alameda County prosecutors because of her key role in bringing the charges against the seven officers. Price said that Abuslin is not a drug addict and accused the Richmond Police Department of sending her to the Florida facility under false pretenses, potentially tampering with a witness. Richmond police interim Chief Allwyn Brown said in a report issued earlier this week that allegations that the department sent her there distort reality. Instead, Brown said the department helped her get funds from the states Victim Compensation Program so she could receive treatment. But Price said the facility was incapable of providing the kind of care that Abuslin needs. We have many lovely facilities in the Bay Area and throughout California. The kind of treatment she needs is not from a drug rehab facility, Price said. As a lawyer, I dont tamper with witnesses, she said. She is a witness to criminal activity, to criminal conspiracy in the Bay Area. There is no reason at all for why she is in Florida. Abuslin is expected to testify against seven current and former law enforcement officers, including five from the Oakland Police Department, who Alameda County District Attorney Nancy OMalley announced last week would be facing criminal charges. The most serious charges are for two officers accused of felony oral copulation with a minor. Price said Abuslin has been a victim of sex trafficking since she was 12 years old. She came under investigation by the Oakland Police Department last year for a relationship she had with Officer Brendan OBrien, who killed himself in September 2015 and implicated himself and other officers in a suicide note. Her attorneys have continued to suggest that there may be more such victims of exploitation who have not come forward.Bay Area police officers engaged in a conspiracy to sexually traffic children. She is not the only one, Price said. Its happening every day. It happened in a lot of different places under a lot of different circumstances. Payment can be money, it can be intimidation, it can be I will let you live today. I will kill you in this room. she said. This child has been kidnapped, she has been held against her will. The fact that she is alive today is a miracle. Despite the Oakland police internal investigation being opened last year, details of the scandal did not emerge publicly until May. Other departments, such as in Richmond and Livermore, did not learn of their officers involvement until after the case was reported in the media. Since then, dozens of officers in at least eight different law enforcement agencies have been implicated. Last week, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf announced that 12 Oakland police officers would be disciplined, including four who would be fired. Days later, OMalley announced criminal charges against five Oakland police officers, a Livermore officer and a Contra Costa County sheriffs deputy. A total of 11 Richmond police officers were investigated in connection with the scandal. Brown said this week that some of them would be fired or disciplined but refused to provide further details. Former Contra Costa County sheriffs Deputy Ricardo Perez and Oakland police Officer Giovanni LoVerde are each facing charges of felony oral copulation with a minor. If convicted, they could face 16 months to three years in state prison. Perez will also be charged with two counts of engaging in a lewd act in a public place. Former Livermore police Officer Dan Black will be charged with two counts of engaging in an act of prostitution and two counts of lewd acts in public. Oakland police Officer Brian Bunton faces one count of felony conspiracy to obstruct justice, which carries a possible sentence of a year in prison, and one misdemeanor charge of engaging in an act of prostitution. Retired Oakland police Officer Leroy Johnson will be charged with one count of failing to report sexual misconduct concerning a minor. Oakland police Officer Warit Utappa will be accused of searching official criminal justice data and computer systems for an unauthorized purpose. Former Oakland police Officer Tyrell Smith, who resigned in May, faces four counts of the same crime. Price called for possible federal intervention because of the widespread regional allegations. A federal judge overseeing court-mandated reforms to the Oakland Police Department as part of a 2003 settlement agreement already stepped in once in March, questioning the integrity of the departments internal affairs investigation. In his latest report issued Monday, court-appointed monitor Robert Warshaw said that while he was satisfied with the conclusion of the investigation, he was concerned about how it was initially handled. He reiterated that the fallout from the scandal has led to perhaps the most trying time in OPDs history. Judge Thelton Henderson wrote in his March 23 order, This case raises most serious concerns that may well impact Defendants ability to demonstrate their commitment to accountability and sustainability - both of which are key to ending court oversight. In his report Monday, Warshaw wrote, While there still remain some issues to be resolved regarding the sufficiency of resources devoted to the investigation until the matter was brought to the attention of the Court, we recognize the efforts of the City, OPD, and its leadership on this extensive investigation.

1722,"Three men accused of stealing watches in a smash-and-grab robbery that resulted in the evacuation of Twelve Oaks Mall Saturday remain at large, Novi police said Monday. The robbery occurred around 5:20 p.m. at a Tappers jewelry store inside the mall. The suspects used a small hammer to break the glass display case and got away with two watches of undisclosed value before fleeing the scene on foot, police said. Police have released surveillance photos of the suspects and have asked anyone who recognizes them to contact Det. Sgt. Scott Baetens at (248) 348-7100. Anonymous tips may be left with Crime Stoppers at (800) SPEAKUP. The mall was placed on lockdown and evacuated after reports of an active shooter, but those reports proved unfounded, police said. Instead, police said the sounds of glass shattering and a glass door being slammed as one suspect fled were mistaken for gunshots. The sound caused widespread panic inside the mall, which Twitter user Nick Orzel, of Livonia, captured on video and posted, originally with the message, SHOOTING IN 12 OAKS. The video quickly went viral. It has been retweeted 2,214 times, and it led to speculations that werent true, including that hostages had been taken. Orzel told The Detroit News that he didnt hear anything besides people yelling gun,  adding that he didnt learn until about an hour later that there was no gun. Novi Police Chief Novi Police Chief David Molloy sent a tweet saying there was no active shooter, but it was only retweeted 123 times. Dan Jones, the mall manager, declined to comment when asked by The Detroit News if the mall would have been evacuated without the confusion surrounding a possible shooter. We do regular training exercises with police to handle a variety of topics so we feel as prepared as we can be for the unknown, Jones said in an email to the newspaper. While nothing is ever managed perfectly in an emergency situation, we feel our response was prompt and properly handled. Besides Novi police, law enforcement officers from Wixom, the Oakland County Sheriffs Office and Michigan State Police responded to the mall. The mass exodus from the mall hampered police in their response, Baetens told The Detroit News. It hampered us, he said, but not to the degree that we couldnt do our job.",0

1724,"In a potentially precedent-setting decision, a man and woman in Saugus have been found guilty in a case of a sexual assault recorded on Snapchat. The series of Snapchat videos show the victim, 16 at the time, standing naked in the woods and trying to say stop, before showing what prosecutors claim to be a sexual assault on a girl who was stumbling and slurring due to drugs and alcohol, according to testimony in the case. The videos, which appear on the app and then vanish once viewed, were taken in September 2014. After hearing testimony from a friend who viewed and took screenshots of the original video, seeing those screenshots and hearing testimony from the victim herself, jurors reached a guilty verdict Tuesday. Rashad Deihim, 21, and Kailyn Bonia, 20, were found guilty on counts of assault to rape, indecent assault and battery on person 14 or over, and kidnapping, The Boston Globe reports. Deihim was found guilty on charges of posing a child in a state of nudity. Bonia was found not guilty of that charge. They are scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 6. Wicked Local Saugus previously reported the district attorneys office has obtained videos provided by Snapchat. An Essex County District Attorney spokeswoman initially told the paper the videos were obtained from Snapchat by the prosecution via preservation order. The paper subsequently reported that the Snapchat footage obtained by the DA was not one of the three allegedly incriminating videos viewed by the victims friend. The judge ruled the 10-second video depicting the alleged incident was not admissible in court because Snapchat representatives refused to give testimony explaining why only one video of the alleged incident was saved on their server, according to Wicked Local.

1735,"The rape and strangulation death of Brenda Lee Ritter, 18, of North Strabane Township on May 18 or 19, 1977, is a case that still haunts police. Ritters death occurred as the fourth in a series of slayings of young women in Washington County. The murders of Deborah Capriola, Mary Irene Gency and Susan Rush left county residents on edge. The death of Barbara Lewis in Penn Hills within the same time frame left investigators wondering if Ritters strangulation death was at the hands of the same killer. According to a Sept. 28, 2003, story in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Ritter left her boyfriends home in Chartiers Township at about 10:10 p.m. on May 18, 1977, during a raging thunderstorm. The boyfriend, Larry Bonazza, and his mother made sure that the doors of Ritters Ford Pinto were locked because of the slayings, and then, watched her drive away. The slender blonde worked as a secretary for Kennedy and Carter, a Washington construction firm. Ritters abandoned car was found in neighboring South Strabane Township the next morning. Before a massive search got under way that afternoon, searchers in a state police helicopter spotted Ritters nearly nude remains on a hillside off of rural Roupe Road, about three-quarters of a mile from her car. Her clothes were also found within about 50 feet of her body. South Strabane and North Strabane police received the help of 25 Pennsylvania state troopers in their investigation. As a result of those efforts, investigators determined that Ritter was raped and then strangled using a tourniquet-type device made from her panties and a stick. Farrell Jackson, then the Washington County coroner, said that tests placed the time of death at between 11:30 p.m. and midnight. Some forensic evidence—including hair and fingerprints—was found in the car. At one point, a broken bracelet with the name Jack engraved on it, which was found in the vicinity of the murder, was considered potential evidence. Tests run on Ritter to see if a drug was used in her abduction came back negative. Donald Sofchak, the South Strabane police chief at the time, said that an investigation determined that Ritter had not taken her normal route home from the Meadow Lands, where the Bonazzas lived. At the time, there was some thought among investigators that, perhaps, someone posing as a police officer could have gained access to Ritters car without a fight. Her car appeared to have no damage to it. Jackson shared a profile of the killer shortly after Ritters murder, describing him as between 20 and 30, not unattractive but average in appearance; not too intelligent but smart enough to know his victims routes and follow them ... and began his sex life rather late and gets violent after the sex act. According to that profile, that man would likely be between 55 and 65 years old today. There was some hope of solving Ritters murder in 1983 when Henry Lee Lucas, a serial killer in Texas, admitted to killing women in 16 states. But Lucas was never charged in Ritters death nor in any of the murders of area young women during that era. --- Follow the Baldwin-Whitehall Patch on Facebook and Twitter.

1736,"O.J. Simpson will have a lot going for him when he asks parole board members in Nevada this week to release him from prison after serving more than eight years for armed robbery. The former former football star and TV pitchman is nearing the nine-year minimum of his 33-year sentence for an ill-fated attempt to retrieve sports memorabilia. The parole board has sided with Simpson, now 70, once before. He also has a clean record behind bars. No one at his Thursday hearing is expected to oppose releasing him in October, including the victim and the former prosecutor who convinced a Las Vegas jury to convict Simpson in 2008. (For more local news, click here to sign up for real-time news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) Assuming that hes behaved himself in prison, I dont think it will be out of line for him to get parole, said David Roger, the retired Clark County district attorney. Four other men who went with Simpson to a hotel room to retrieve from two memorabilia dealers sports collectibles and personal items that the former football star said belonged to him took plea deals in the heist and received probation. Two of those men testified that they carried guns. Another who stood trial with Simpson was convicted and served 27 months before the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that Simpsons fame tainted the jury. Simpsons conviction was upheld. Prison life was a stunning fall for a charismatic celebrity whose storybook career as an electrifying running back dubbed The Juice won him the Heisman Trophy as the best college player in 1968 and a place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985. He became a sports commentator, Hollywood movie actor, car rental company spokesman and one of the worlds most famous people even before his Los Angeles trial of the century, when he was acquitted in the killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. Simpson, appeared grayer and heavier than most remembered him when he was last seen, four years ago. He will appear Thursday by videoconference from the Lovelock Correctional Center, to be quizzed by four state parole commissioners in Carson City, a two-hour drive away. Two other members of the board will monitor the hearing, said David Smith, a parole hearing examiner. The commissioners will have a parole hearing report that has not been made public, plus guidelines and worksheets that would appear to favor Simpson. It plans to make its written risk assessment public after a decision. They will consider his age, whether his conviction was for a violent crime (it was), his prior criminal history (he had none) and his plans after release, Smith said. Nevada has about 13,500 prison inmates, and the governor-appointed Board of Parole Commissioners has averaged about 8,300 annual hearings for the past four years. The rate of inmates who are granted parole in discretionary hearings held as they approach their minimum sentence, like Simpsons, averages about 82 percent. The same four board members also have experience with Simpson, having granted him parole in July 2013 on some charges — kidnapping, robbery and burglary — stemming from the 2007 armed confrontation. The boards decision left Simpson with four years to serve before reaching his minimum time behind bars. Board members Connie Bisbee, Tony Corda, Adam Endel and Susan Jackson noted at the time that Simpson had a positive institutional record, with no disciplinary actions behind bars. Simpsons lawyer, friends and prison officials say that hasnt changed. Hes really been a positive force in there. Hes done a lot of good for a lot of people, said Tom Scotto, a friend from Florida whose wedding Simpson was in Las Vegas to attend the weekend of the robbery. Scotto said he visits or talks with Simpson every few months. Simpson leads a Baptist prayer group, mentors inmates, works in the gym, coaches sports teams and serves as commissioner of the prison yard softball league, Scotto said. Scotto will be among the 15 people with Simpson in a small conference room at the prison, along with Simpsons lawyer, Malcolm LaVergne, daughter Arnelle Simpson and sister Shirley Baker. A parole case worker, two prison guards and a small pool of media also were expected, along with Bruce Fromong, one of the memorabilia dealers who was robbed. Fromong said he will attend as a victim of the crime but will be trying to be good for O.J. He said he suffered four heart attacks and severe financial losses as a result of the robbery but later forgave Simpson. The other collectibles broker, Alfred Beardsley, died in 2015. Andy Caldwell, a retired Las Vegas police detective who investigated the Simpson case, will be at the prison but wont be in the room. I dont want to offer an opinion, said Caldwell, now a Christian minister in Mill City, Oregon. Im just curious to see how everything unfolds. In a nod to Simpsons celebrity, officials will let the proceedings be streamed live, and the board plans a same-day ruling. A decision usually takes several days. Laurie Levenson, a Loyola Law School professor and longtime Simpson case analyst, predicted a tsunami of public attention if Simpson wins release. If this is the ordinary case, he will be paroled, Levenson said. But O.J. is never the ordinary case. Al Lasso, a Las Vegas defense attorney who has followed the case but does not represent Simpson, said any other defendant in a similar case probably would have gotten probation, not prison. I think he spent more than enough time in prison for a robbery in which he didnt even have a gun himself, Lasso said. But Michael Shapiro, a New York defense lawyer who provided commentary during Simpsons conviction in Las Vegas in 2008 and his acquittal in Los Angeles in 1995, said freedom was no certainty. The judge believed he got away with murder, Shapiro said. Thats the elephant in the room. If the parole authorities feel the same way, he could be in trouble.

1737,"Why have you never sought justice for Timmy? Because the police think you did it? That wouldnt stop me if it was my kid. Those are some of the words expressed by Michael Lodzinski in a letter to his sister, Michelle, that was sent to her before she was convicted Wednesday for the 1991 murder of her son, Timmy. NJ Advance Media published the full letter a day after a jury of seven men and five women convicted Michelle Lodzinski after eight weeks of testimony. If you never talk to me again I understand, according to the letter. I just keep thinking about Timmy. The family deserves answers. I feel we have failed Timmy and we have failed you too. He told her he just wanted to encourage her to do the right thing and to be honest about what happened to the boy. All the lies, why? Michelles family has been largely supportive of her during the 25-year saga, marked by her frequent attempts to cover up the crime, the discovery of the body behind the Raritan Center and other nefarious dealings involving Lodzinski. Michael, however, has been more skeptical as of late, noting that Michelle was convicted for faking her own kidnapping in 1994, and was later convicted for stealing a computer. Still, Michael noted that he was among the very few from the family who still wanted to help her. After the verdict was read in court, he yelled: I love you sis! The jury deliberated a little less than four hours after nj.com reported the foreman was replaced Tuesday with an alternate because of a personal matter. Lodzinskis trial was to began two years after she was arrested even though she was long considered the prime suspect since the boy went missing from a Sayreville carnival in May 1991. He was excited, she said of Timothy Wiltseys state of mind, according to a tape of her police interview. Soon after, Timothy was found dead. Wiltseys remains were found in a marshy area in Raritan Center in Edison, about five miles from where he disappeared, nearly a year after his disappearance. After the murder, Lodzinski moved to Florida, got married and had even more children, according to My9 Chasing NJ. After Lodzinski originally told police that she last saw her son at a carnival in Middlesex County, the investigation turned up that no one can confirm that they ever saw the little boy at the fair. Her attorney, Gerald Krovatin was expected to argue that this case should have been brought more than two decades ago, but the Middlesex County Prosecutos Office says there is new evidence, according to the nj.com report. Here is how nj.com recalled the trial: Jurors sat through eight weeks of testimony and heard from 68 witnesses, including retired police officers, ex-neighbors and boyfriends and an Arizona ex-con who testified that a former cellmate told him he had killed a young boy at an event in New Jersey in 1991. Prosecutors based their case on a childs blanket found nearby. Former babysitters say the blanket came from the Lodzinski home, but no forensic evidence was found linking it to Lodzinski or her son, according to the report. Lodzinski has said Timothy disappeared while she went to buy soda and that he was taken by two people, and that a woman in a red car abducted him at knifepoint, according to the report.

1739,"A judge is expected to rule by the end of the week on where a trial will be held for a man charged with the kidnapping and murder of 15-year-old Sierra LaMar four years ago. Superior Court Judge Vanessa Zecher heard oral arguments on a change of venue motion filed by defense attorneys for the trial of 25-year-old Antolin Garcia-Torres, who was also present during Tuesday mornings hearing at the Hall of Justice in San Jose. Sierra, whose body hasnt been found, was last seen on the morning of March 16, 2012 leaving her home in unincorporated Morgan Hill but never caught her bus to go to school. Zecher is expected to issue a written decision by the end of this week on whether the trial will be held in or out of Santa Clara County. The attorneys arguments were based on testimony heard for three consecutive days last week from Edward Bronson, a professor emeritus at California State University, Chico, who said the trial should be held in another jurisdiction. He was brought in as a defense witness to discuss his research on a survey of 300 county residents about the case and more than 100 news articles in the past four years since Sierras disappearance. Brian Matthews of the Santa Clara County Alternate Defender Office argued today that the survey showed jurors could be prejudiced by local news coverage of the case, which has become a reference point for other cases. Since her disappearance, Sierra has become a universal daughter exclusively in Santa Clara County and has led a large to county act like a small one, Matthews said. This case has hit a nerve with the community, Matthews said. The level of prominence in the county is very significant compared to other counties and changing the hearing venue would give Garcia-Torres a chance at a fair trial, Matthews said. Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Dana Veazey argued that no matter where the trial is heard, Sierra will be considered a universal daughter and was a child, which will affect jurors wherever the trial is heard. Bronsons survey wasnt conducted in neighboring counties to test the salience levels compared to Santa Clara County, Veazey said. There was no scientific evidence that supported the argument that Santa Clara County acted as a small county in response to Sierras case, according to Veazey. The survey showed more than 50 percent of people didnt know about the case or recognized it and were able to identify another fact, Veazey said. Bronson conducted a quantitative analysis of the news articles that included articles on the front page of newspapers that mentioned the case, but the overall subject was largely on a different matter. Certain words that the professor considered highly prejudiced based on his research of news coverage in the case were the same ones used in the survey, which showed the articles werent biased but merely described the facts, according to Veazey. The judge is scheduled to continue a hearing on a motion to suppress evidence in the case on Friday afternoon at the Hall of Justice.

1740,"Prosecutors will once again seek the death penalty for two leaders of the violent Mexican Los Palillos drug trafficking gang, who were convicted of several murders and kidnappings in San Diego County between 2004 and 2007, it was announced today. A penalty phase mistrial was declared last week when jurors told Judge David Rubin they were hopelessly deadlocked on whether to recommend death or life in prison without parole for Jorge Rojas Lopez and Juan Estrada Gonzalez. Deputy District Attorney Mark Amador told the judge today that the District Attorneys Office will again seek the death penalty against both defendants. The penalty phase retrial is not expected to begin before next year. Three other Los Palillos gang members are set to go to trial before then. Rojas Lopez, 34, was found guilty in January of four murders, while Estrada Gonzalez, also 34, was convicted of six counts of first-degree murder in a trial that began in January 2013. Jurors deadlocked on five murder counts against Rojas Lopez. In both cases, jurors found true special circumstance allegations of kidnapping, torture and multiple murders, as well as an allegation that the killings were committed to benefit the defendants gang. Deputy District Attorney Dan Owens told the jury during the first penalty phase that the defendants imported their brand of cartel violence and put it on the streets of San Diego for all of us to see. Owens said the defendants -- members of the Los Palillos or toothpicks gang -- were evil men who committed evil deeds out of revenge and greed, including shooting at a Chula Vista police officer and murdering two men on a ranch in San Ysidro, then dissolving their bodies in acid. The beginning of the end for Rojas Lopez and Estrada Gonzalez came on June 16, 2007, when they and three fellow gang members were arrested after kidnapping a wealthy businessman and holding him for ransom in a Chula Vista home for eight days, according to prosecutors. Estrada Gonzalez was also convicted in the kidnapping and murder of a man whose body was stuffed in the trunk of a car, stuck with toothpicks behind his ear and in his buttocks. The defendants are already serving life-without-parole prison sentences after being convicted of kidnapping and other crimes. A status conference is scheduled for June 20.",1
1741,"Thirty years after a young Fort Wayne girl was abducted and killed, police arrested a man Sunday in connection with the famous cold case. According to a recent police affidavit obtained by Patch, Fort Wayne Police Department and Indiana State Police arrested 59-year-old John D. Miller of Grabill for the 1988 homicide of 8-year-old April Tinsley. According to a probable cause affidavit from police, the DNA recovered from the first-graders underwear in 1988 matched Millers DNA. Police say that on April 1, 1988, Tinsley was abducted from her south-central Fort Wayne neighborhood while walking to a friends home. Three days later, a jogger found her body in a ditch in southern DeKalb County. Shed been sexually molested, suffocated, and dead for at least two days, police said. In the years after the murder, police believed the killer was taunting them, and terrorizing other children in Indiana. In 1990, two years after Aprils death, a confession was scrawled on the side of a barn in rural northern Indiana. I kill 8 year old April M Tinsley, the confession read, according to the Chicago Tribune. In 2004, horrifying messages — along with used condoms and Polaroids showing parts of a nude mans body — were left on little girls bicycles in the Fort Wayne area, with threats that the child killer would target them next. One note reportedly told a little girl to report the message to the police, threatening to blow her house up if she didnt. Years later, those messages, including some that referred to April Tinsley, would provide authorities with DNA that matched the DNA found in Aprils underwear, the Tribune reported. (Get Across Indiana Patchs daily newsletter and real-time news alerts. Or, find your local Patch here and subscribe. Like us on Facebook. Also, download the free Patch iPhone app or free Patch Android app.) But how did authorities track down Miller three decades later? According to the affidavit, a DNA technology company working with FWPD narrowed the suspect list down to two brothers, Miller and another man, leading police to begin surveillance at the start of this month on Millers mobile home and analyze his trash, recovering condoms to pull DNA from. According to court documents, when police arrived at Millers home Sunday, they asked him if he knew why they were there, to which police said Miller answered, April Tinsley, before admitting the crime to investigators. The police affidavit also said Miller admitted he abducted Tinsley and took her to his Grabill trailer, where he sexually assaulted and killed her by choking her for nearly 10 minutes so she wouldnt be able to report him to authorities. Miller said he drove Tinsleys body nearly 20 miles north to Spencerville and dumped her, the documents say. On social media, there have been plenty of strong reactions to Millers arrest in this cold case. Miller was booked into Allen County Jail Sunday on murder, child molestation and criminal confinement charges, and is scheduled to be arraigned in Allen Superior Court Monday.

1744,"Authorities have noticed an uptick in virtual kidnapping, a telephone scam also used on social media, according to Prince William County Police. The scammers try to convince victims their loved ones have been kidnapped and demand money for their release. Here are some examples and tips from police: In the scheme, individuals claiming to have kidnapped a family member. While no actual kidnapping hastaken place, the callers often use co-conspirators to convince their victims of the legitimacy of the threat.For example, a caller might attempt to convince a victim that his daughter was kidnapped by having ayoung female scream for help in the background during the call. The stated reason they are holding thealleged victim varies, but some of the most prominent scams involve car accidents, drug debts, gangassaults, or persons being smuggled across the border. In another example, a caller may attempt to convince a victim that her husband or son was in a car accident with a gang member. The individual calling pretends to be a friend or relative of the gang member. This person tells the victim that their family member is seriously injured and needs to go to the hospital, but that their friend will not allow them to go the hospital until he gets paid for the damages done to his vehicle.Victim telephone numbers appear to be dialed at random. Callers typically provide the victim with specific instructions to ensure safe return of the allegedlykidnapped individual. In some cases, these instructions involve demands of a ransom payment. Callersare ordered to stay on the phone until the money is wired, often to a third party in Puerto Rico. Most schemes use various techniques to instill a sense of fear, panic, and urgency in an effort to rush the victim into making a very hasty decision. Instructions usually require that the ransom is paid immediately—typically by wire transfer. Typically, once a payment is made, the alleged kidnappers claim the money was not received and demand that victims wire additional money. To avoid becoming a victim of this scheme, look for the following possible indicators: The scammers are skimming information about victims and their families by searching through social media. It is important to monitor what is posted online and to make sure you have the proper privacysettings in place. Should you be traveling avoid sharing your location on social media and be on high alert during especially during time of such a spring break and major holidays. If you believe you are the victim of this scam, call our Communications Bureau at 703 792 6500 to reportit. If you believe your family member is victim of an actual kidnapping, call 911 immediately.

1746,"Photo Credit: Erlanger Police Department/Facebook The man who caused a traffic nightmare on the Downtown Connector on Monday afternoon is wanted for kidnapping in his home state, police in Kentucky confirm. According to WCPO in Cincinnati, Michael W. Webster allegedly kidnapped a woman in Erlanger, KY, on Dec. 18. He allegedly assaulted the woman, threatened the woman and her child, and kept the woman inside a car for several hours. Police in Kentucky executed a search warrant on one of Websters known residences last Tuesday and received a warrant for Websters arrest last Wednesday, but he was nowhere to be found. An Erlanger Police Department spokesman told WCPO that Webster was a dangerous suspect and was likely to flee from any law enforcement he encountered. On Monday, he did exactly that. According to the Georgia State Patrol, Webster was spotted driving a motorcycle at a high rate of speed on I-75 southbound near Akers Mill Road in Cobb County. A trooper attempted to pull the motorcycle over, but a chase ensued. GSP says that the motorcycle swerved in and out of traffic on the interstate before crashing into the back of a disabled vehicle in the right emergency lane just north of 10th St. After hitting the vehicle, Webster was thrown from the bike and landed on the interstate, while the motorcycle kept going and eventually hit the passenger side of another vehicle.

1750,"- A man accused of pretending to be a ride-hailing service driver in order to lure women and sexually assault them made his first appearance in San Francisco courtroom this afternoon. Orlando Vilchez Lazo, 37, is being charged with four counts of rape, three counts of kidnapping, three counts of kidnapping to commit another crime, and two counts of sexual penetration with a foreign object, force and violence, according to court records. Bail for Vilchez Lazo was initially set at $4,234,000, however, Judge Braden Woods today ordered that Vilchez Lazo be held without bail. Vilchez Lazo did not enter a plea and his arraignment was postponed to Thursday. The Public Defenders Office is representing Vilchez Lazo. Police have dubbed him as the Rideshare Rapist. Officers arrested Vilchez Lazo on July 12 in San Mateo County after they confirmed that he was linked by DNA evidence to four separate sexual assaults in the San Francisco, one in 2013 and three others this year. There was a task force assembled between the Police Department and the District Attorneys Office. There was good police work done and we were able to identify, arrest and charge someone with multiple rape counts, Alex Bastian, spokesman with the District Attorneys Office said. This is someone who has no criminal history, so if anyone has information about this case, we ask that you contact the Police Department or our office. The case remains under investigation. According to police, Vilchez Lazo posed as the driver of a ride-hailing service, hanging around downtown San Francisco nightclubs, seeking female victims. The first alleged assault occurred in November 2013 when a woman leaving a bar got into Vilchez Lazos vehicle, mistaking him for her driver. Vilchez Lazo then took the woman to another location and raped her, police said. The victim immediately reported the alleged sexual assault and police were able to obtain forensic evidence. The evidence was put into CODICE, a criminal database, but no matches came up at the time and the case went cold. However, earlier this year, in February, a similar sexual assault allegedly occurred and from that, investigators again obtained forensic evidence. Once entered into the CODICE system, the evidence matched-up with the evidence from the 2013 sexual assault. In May, a third sexual assault allegedly occurred in a similar manner. The forensic evidence from that third assault matched the evidence from the two previous assaults, according to police. Officers then assembled a task force in order to identify and apprehend the suspect. Shortly after, however, in June, a fourth sexual assault allegedly occurred involving a man posing as ride-hailing driver. The forensic evidence from that incident once again matched the evidence from the now three other previous assaults. Soon after, the task force followed numerous leads to track the suspect down. On July 7, undercover officers in the citys South of Market neighborhood observed suspicious behavior from a driver operating what appeared to be a ride-hailing vehicle. Officers stopped the vehicle and identified the driver as Vilchez Lazo and took a DNA sample for analysis and comparison. Last week, investigators were able to confirm that Vilchez Lazos DNA matched the forensic evidence from the four alleged sexual assaults and moved to arrest him. Investigators are trying to determine whether Vilchez Lazo had ever legitimately worked for a ride-hailing service company. Also, because of the gap between the 2013 assault and the three others this year, police believe there may be more victims. Anyone who may be a victim by Vilchez Lazo or who may have witnessed one of the alleged sexual assaults is asked to contact the Police Departments special victims unit at (415) 553-1521 or the 24-hour tipline at (415) 575-4444 or text a tip to TIP411 with SFPD at the beginning of the message. --Bay City News/Photo via Shutterstock",1

1755,"Camden was among seven cities nationwide that was targeted by Operation Violence Reduction7 (VR7), a six-week long U.S. Marshals-led enforcement initiative conducted across the country to reduce violent crime. More than 7,100 fugitives, gang members, sex offender suspects and suspects of violent crime were charged in Camden, Oakland, Chicago, Atlanta, Baltimore, New Orleans and Fort Lauderdale between March 2, and April 10, 2015. The Camden County Police Departments involvement in this program resulted in 84 violent criminals being removed from the streets of Camden, Camden County Police Chief Scott Thomson said. By eliminating that very small percentage of people that are committing the majority of the violent crime, you can start to change the dynamics of neighborhoods. The criteria for cases adopted and investigated during Operation VR7 included fugitives wanted for murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, robbery, aggravated assault, arson, abduction/kidnapping, sexual assault and child molestation. Investigators focused on capturing fugitives with three or more prior felony arrests for violent crimes and wanted for narcotics, weapons offenses, assault/battery and threats. Gang members and sex offenders received high-priority. The purpose of Operation VR7 was to protect our communities by removing the most dangerous criminals from the streets, U.S. Marshals Service Director Stacia Hylton said. The operation utilized a strategic approach to identify and arrest the most violent wanted felony fugitives quickly in order to see the greatest impact on public safety. Specifically, Operation VR7 resulted in 7,127 arrests, including 750 gang members, and the seizure of 383 firearms and more than 69 kilograms of illegal narcotics. Individual charges included 519 for homicide; 922 for weapons; 1,888 for assault; 583 for sexual assault; 1,093 for robbery; and 2,654 for narcotics, according to the U.S. Marshals service. The U.S.Marshals have established counter gang units in the seven cities selected. Those units provided real time, ground level intelligence on criminal activity throughout the operation. Our counter gang units along with our federal, state, and local partners were able to hone in on areas with numerous outstanding warrants, and ensure that apprehension measures were deliberate and effective, Chief Inspector John Buck Smith, Operation VR7 Commander, said. By taking these dangerous fugitives off the streets, we hope people feel safer in their communities, Hylton said. Many of these fugitives we arrested were repeat offenders, who average eight prior arrests and three prior convictions for violent crimes.",0

1759,"A 28-year old man was killed by police who were responding to a call they now believe may have been a prank by an online gamer. Authorities are now investigating the deadly encounter in Wichita, Kansas. Falsely reporting crimes in an attempt to get a SWAT team to descend upon a home is a common prank in the online gaming industry known as swatting. Deputy Police Chief Troy Livingston said the shooting happened Thursday while an officer was responding to a report that a father had been shot in the head and that the shooter was holding his mother, brother and sister hostage, The Wichita Eagle reports. Livingston said a 28-year-old man was shot as he came to the front door. Livingston said that when officers got inside the house, they didnt find anyone with gunshot wounds. Livingston didnt say what caused the officer to shoot the man or whether he was armed. Police dont think the man fired at officers, but the incident is still under investigation, he said. The man died at a hospital.The man hasnt been identified by police. But Madeline Finch identified the victim as her nephew, Andrew Finch. She said the family was saddened but declined to comment further. Livingston says police are investigating whether the call that led to the shooting was a prank. Officer Paul Cruz told The Associated Press that more information would be released at a news conference, which has been moved to 4 p.m., and that he couldnt comment. The officer who fired the shot — a seven-year veteran of the police department — will be placed on administrative paid leave, which is department policy. Several people inside the home are being interviewed. Swatting is believed to be more common among the online gaming community. The FBI estimates that roughly 400 cases of swatting occur annually, with some using caller ID spoofing to disguise their number. In January, three families in Florida had to evacuate their homes in Florida after a detective received an anonymous email claiming bombs had been placed at the address. A 20-year-old Maryland man was shot in the face with rubber bullets by police in 2015 after a fake hostage situation was reported at his home. Rep. Katherine Clark, a Massachusetts Democrat, introduced an anti-swatting bill in 2015 — then was herself the victim of swatting. Armed officers in 2016 responded to an anonymous call claiming an active shooter was at Clarks home.___Information from: The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle, http://www.kansas.com Photo credit: Shutterstock",0

Green, who also recently lived in Plainfield, according to jail records, faced up to 10 years in prison before he was sentenced Wednesday. In January 2013, Green drove his Ford Explorer past a 16-year-old girl who was walking along Far Hills Drive in a subdivision north of Bolingbrook High School.

He told police he and his brother were out drinking with the other man and when they got back to the motel, his brother, Tim Andrews, 29, of Twinsburg, took the mans truck to go for a beer run. Todd said the man gave Tim the keys, but had no idea where his brother was. The victims story was a bit different.

1769,"The attorneys of -- have filed a motion asking that his trial be held outside of Lake County. McSween, 49, was found murdered Nov. 26, 2010, near on Andrews Road in Mentor-on-the-Lake. Thomass attorneys -- David Doughten and Chief Assistant Lake County Public Defender Charles Grieshammer -- believe the attention the crime and Thomass ensuing arrest have received will make it difficult for him to find an impartial jury in Lake County. Lake County (was) saturated with extensive media coverage of the incident at the time of the offense, the attorneys wrote in a motion to Lake County Common Pleas Judge Richard L. Collins. Similar coverage is likely to resume once the trial begins. The media accounts have left little room for factfinding at trial and have created a presumption of the defendants guilt that is widespread in the community. Consequently, the attorneys asked the trial, which is scheduled to begin September 5, be held elsewhere. After such vast pretrial publicity has been revealed, it becomes a legal fiction to assume that jurors will preserve the presumption that a defendant is innocent, Thomass attorneys concluded in their motion. The Lake County Prosecutors Office has not yet filed a rebuttal to their motion yet. After a rebuttal is filed, Collins will decide if Thomas should be tried in or out of Lake County. Thomas, 27, is accused of killing Mcsween after she had tended bar at Lakeway Lounge the night she was murdered. She closed the bar but never made it home. Her body was found behind the house at 5612 Andrews Road, next to the bar, at 8:39 a.m. She had been beaten, strangled and repeatedly stabbed, according to authorities. She likely bled to death.

Along with the attack, Hill also has been blamed with setting in motion the disturbing events of Jan. 3 by picking up the victim in a stolen van New Years Eve of 2016. The two teens had been classmates at a school in Aurora, and the judge in the case has accused Hill of using that past relationship to gain — and then betray — the victims trust. After spending a couple days driving around Chicagos West Side, Hill and the victim eventually ended up at the West Lexington Avenue apartment of two of the defendants. Initially, all four defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges in February. But last month, Brittany Covington struck a deal with prosecutors, and she pleaded guilty to the hate crime, aggravated battery and intimidation charges. In exchange for changing her plea, Covington was put on probation for four years, and she could be required to testify against the other defendants. The kidnapping count against her also was dropped, but she is prohibited from using social media for four years and must complete 200 hours of community service.

1774,"A man suspected in the 2005 slayings of two Zion girls could be put to death in Virginia for strangling a fellow Marine in 2009. Jorge Torrez, 25, a Zion, IL, native linked by DNA to the murders of 8-year-old Laura Hobbs and 9-year-old Krystal Tobias, who disappeared on Mothers Day, has left a trail of death and terror in his wake throughout his adult life. On Monday, a federal jury decided Torrez, convicted earlier this month of first-degree murder in the 2009 death of 20-year-old Marine Amanda Jean Snell, is eligible for the death penalty, the Washington Post reported. Prosecutors said Torrez is a sexual predator who browsed Internet sites about rape fantasies and randomly attacked the women in suburban Arlington, VA, after Snells death, the Post reported. In the 2009 attack on Snell, prosecutors said Torrez attacked Snell at random, creeping into her room at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall and wrapping the young womans neck with the power cord of her pink laptop. Torrez was convicted in October 2010 for the Arlington attacks. In one instance, he displayed a gun to a woman and tried to force her into a car. Failing, he stole her purse. In another Arlington case, Torrez, brandishing a handgun, confronted two women and tied them up inside a residence. He forced one of the victims to leave the house with him. Four hours later, the victim was found seeking help and medical treatment. In 2011, the Chicago Tribune interviewed Torrez from a prison cell and asked him about the Zion girls murders and why the 8-year-old child had his semen on her body. Hobbs and Tobias, stabbed to death, were found together in a park. Im not denying that (the DNA) is mine, he told the paper. Once I tell them how my DNA got there, Im walking. Torrez was in prison serving five life sentences for rape and abduction in the Virginia cases. Once a corporal in the Marine Corps, Torrez now faces possible execution for taking the life of a fellow Marine.",0
1775,"On Monday, an Essex County Superior Court jury found Valentine Underwood, 53, guilty today of aggravated rape and kidnapping, one day short of the 26th anniversary of the crime. Judge Howard Whitehead sentenced him to 30 to 40 years in state prison to follow the two life sentences the defendant is currently serving in California for murder. He was charged with kidnapping a 24-year-old woman in Andover. He raped her, stabbed her, and left her to die in a ditch, prosecutors said. Underwood represented himself during trial in Salem Superior Court.  The Essex County District Attorneys office said Underwoods crime went largely unsolved until 2009 when Andover Police submitted a rape kit taken at the time of the crime to the Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab where it generated a match to Underwood. Underwood was indicted on the charges in 2011 following a joint investigation by the Essex District Attorneys Office, Andover Police, Rockingham County Attorneys Office and Hampton, NH Police. This woman courageously fought for her life 26 years ago and she just as courageously testified in this trial.  I hope that this verdict and sentence provides her with the justice that was so long delayed, District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said in a statement issued Monday night.  Essex Assistant District Attorney Kate MacDougall introduced evidence that proved that on May 20, 1988, Valentine Underwood forced the then 24-year-old victims car off River Road in Andover. He forcibly removed her from her car and put her in his truck. He then drove around Essex County and Southern New Hampshire, stopping to rape her at knifepoint. He eventually pulled over just past the toll booths in Hampton, NH, where he stabbed the victim in her side and attempted to slit her throat. She was able to deflect the knife and the blade broke off in her hand. After she threw the blade, Underwood beat her repeatedly and left her for dead. The victim was able to get back to the highway and flag down a passing motorist who took her to Exeter Hospital where she received treatment and a rape kit.  ADA MacDougall commended the work of Andover Police Commander Charles Heseltine and Officer William Wallace; Hampton, NH Detectives Chris Gilroy, retired Detectives William Lally and Philip Russell and Exeter, NH Chief Richard Kane. In addition, she praised the Massachusetts State Police Crime Laboratory and Essex Sheriffs Department, who provided additional security during the course of the trial. Essex Victim Witness Advocate Kathy Draper provided assistance to the victim throughout the process.",1
1776,"Atlanta police have released a sketch of the suspect being sought in connection with two attempted abduction/kidnappings earlier this week in southeast Atlanta. The incidents occurred , when a man allegedly kidnapped two women at gunpoint between 1:50 a.m. and 2:20 a.m. The suspect also may have been prowling in Grant Park watching people there. One Ormewood Park mother told East Atlanta Patch her nanny told her that she saw the suspect at the Grant Park playground about a week ago. He was sitting by himself watching people over two consecutive days, the mom reported the nanny telling her. Police are investigating that incident. In the Edgewood case, a Georgia State University student was on the porch with a friend in the 100 block of Mayson Avenue, when the gunman dragged her and forced her into the trunk of his car. He drove around for several minutes before she was able to escape by unlocking the latch from the inside of the trunk at Arkwright Place and Whitefoord Avenue. Moments later, he then went to Reynoldstown and attempted to abduct another woman who was going to her vehicle in the 1100 block of Hawthorne Street near the Walthall Street intersection. She got away when an off-duty Atlanta police officer that lives nearby heard her screams and came to her aid. Late Thursday, police fanned Edgewood and Reynoldtown canvassing the neighborhoods door-to-door and asking residents what, if anything, they saw. APD Maj. Keith Meadows, Zone 6 commander, said it does not appear to be gang-related and that it is not connected to a that have occured in Buckhead in recent years. He did say he is concerned that having failed twice, the suspect may escalate his attacks. Thats always a possibility, Meadows said during a news briefing about the crimes. We have to be mindful that sort of behavior is progressive. Police say the man is: The victims did not get the make or model of the vehicle but describe it as being dark-colored, small and a late 1990s to early 2000s model. Anyone with information is urged to call 911 or Crime Stoppers Atlanta at 404.577.TIPS (8477). A $2,000 reward is being offered for his capture.

1777,"Sheriffs detectives Friday released images of a 21-year- old man wanted in the beating death of another young man whose body was found over the side of a mountain road in Angeles National Forest. Matthew Luzon Martin-Capiendo has been charged along with three other men with capital murder for allegedly bludgeoning Julian Hamori-Andrade, 20, of Glendora at Martin-Capiendos Azusa-area home, then kidnapping him, robbing him and dumping him, battered-yet-still-alive, down a hillside, where he died. Hamori-Andrades body was found about 6 p.m. Wednesday in heavy brush about 30 feet down the hill alongside Highway 39 in Azusa Canyon, and he had suffered what appeared to be blunt force trauma, according to Deputy Trina Schrader of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Information Bureau. Prosecutors and sheriffs officials said the victim was beaten at a home in the 6100 block of Goodway Drive, where authorities found a large pool of blood on the floor on Monday, but no suspects or victim. Hamori-Andrade was driven to Azusa Canyon, where again he was beaten and thrown over the side of the road, according to the sheriffs department. The other three suspects, who are in custody, are acquaintances of the victim. They were identified as Hercules Balaskas, 19, of Glendora; Jacob Hunter Elmendorf, 19, of La Verne; and Francisco Amigon, 19, also of Laverne. All four were charged Thursday with first-degree murder, residential robbery and kidnapping. The murder charges include the special circumstance allegations of lying in wait and murder during the commission of a kidnapping and a robbery. They are scheduled to be arraigned June 6 in Pomona. The defendants all face a possible death sentence, but prosecutors will decide later whether to pursue capital punishment. Sheriffs officials said the victim and suspects were all at Martin- Capiendos home when the victim was brutally beaten before being dragged to a pickup belonging to one of the suspects. Prosecutors contend that Balaskas beat the victim with a metal chair, while Martin-Capiendo wielded a rock and broken glass pipe. The unconscious victim was lifted into the bed of the truck and driven to Azusa Canyon, sheriffs officials said. He was then brutally beaten again before being thrown over the side of a roadside drop off. The victim, who is believed to have been alive upon arriving at the roadside location, succumbed to his injuries. Investigators received tips from passersby who saw the pickup at the location that night, leading them to the body. Martin-Capiendo is described as Filipino, 5 feet 6 inches tall, 220 pounds. He has brown eyes and black hair, though he may have recently shaved his head. He should be considered armed and dangerous and not approached, according to the sheriffs department. Anyone with information regarding his whereabouts or the case in general was urged to contact the Sheriffs Departments Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5500 to speak with Detective Q. Rodriguez or Sgt. Maurizi. Anonymous tips can be submitted through Crime Stoppers by calling (800) 222-TIPS. City News Service; Photo courtesy of the Los Angeles Sheriffs Department",1

1780,"A Honduran national admits that he kidnapped his 27-year-old girlfriend and sexually assaulted her in Missouri, Ohio and New Jersey, in the presence of their 2-year-old daughter, according to authorities. José Amaya-Vasquez, 32, pleaded guilty to a charge of kidnapping and a charge of interstate domestic violence, U.S. Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said on Thursday. He previously admitted that he illegally re-entered the U.S. after having been deported. He was captured in Bellmawr, Camden County, on May 26, 2015, after detectives in Kansas City were able to track him to the Super 8 Motel on the 300 block of the South Black Horse Pike through his cell phone. Amaya-Vasquez attempted to come into the country illegally from Honduras on Feb. 14, 2005, according to documents filed in the case and statements made in court. At that point, he was arrested by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). They gave him a notice to appear in immigration court, and released him from custody. He subsequently failed to appear in court, and an Immigration Judge entered an Order of Removal. On June 7, 2014, he was arrested in Kansas City and charged with domestic assault after he threw a comb at the woman and pushed her into a table. He was removed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from the United States on July 4, 2014. He was then arrested on Sept. 9, 2014, after he illegally entered the country through Texas. Seven days later, he pleaded guilty to a count of illegal entry, and was sentenced to 30 days in prison. On Oct. 22 of that year, he was again removed and banned from returning to America for 20 years. He admitted that he once again illegally entered the country in January of 2015. Five months later, Amaya-Vasquez met the woman in the parking lot of the Burlington Coat factory in Independence, Missouri. He got into her car, threatened her with a knife and duct-taped her. He then took her and the child to an abandoned house in Kansas City, where he sexually assaulted her at knifepoint. On May 24 and 25, he took them towards New York stopping at various locations in Ohio and New Jersey to continue the sexual assaults. Kansas City Police contacted Bellmawr Police, who then reported to the Super 8 Motel on May 26. When Bellmawr Police responded to the motel, the victim opened the door and told police that Amaya-Vasquez escaped through the tile ceiling. Police then chased Amaya-Vasquez into a wooded area, where he allegedly attempted to climb a tree before being captured. The kidnapping count to which Amaya-Vasquez pleaded guilty carries a maximum potential penalty of life in prison and a $250,000 fine. The interstate domestic violence count to which Amaya-Vasquez pleaded guilty carries a maximum potential penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The illegal re-entry into the United States count to which Amaya-Vasquez pleaded guilty carries a maximum potential penalty of two years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 8.",1
1781,"SANTEE, CA: A homeless man found beaten and unconscious Sunday at a Santee River bottom has now died from his injuries and the suspects in the case — two brothers — will be charged with his murder, authorities said. George Lowery, 50, had been hospitalized in critical condition since his wife discovered him lying severely injured Sunday near Chubb Lane and North Magnolia Avenue, according to San Diego County sheriffs Lt. Kenneth Nelson. The lieutenant said Lowery and his wife lived in a nearby homeless encampment. On Thursday, the San Diego County Sheriffs Department announced the arrest of two brothers in connection with the alleged assault: 20-year-old Austin Mostrong and 19-year-old Preston Mostrong, both of Santee. They were initially booked into jail on suspicion of attempted murder, torture and kidnapping. Sheriffs Lt. Kenneth Nelson said Friday the attempted murder charge will be amended to murder, and that a robbery charge will also be added. Physical evidence and witness statements were what led to the brothers arrests, Nelson told Patch. We dont believe it was a random attack; we believe he was targeted, Nelson said. We believe it stemmed from an incident that occurred the previous week at the river bottom. The lieutenant added that detectives worked around the clock to figure out who was responsible for the brutal attack. This person, Mr. Lowery, is one of societys most vulnerable folks, Nelson said. We took it very seriously. The detectives from Santee worked around the clock to solve this case — that is why they were able to solve it so quickly. ***Updated at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time; Originally posted at 11:28 a.m. Pacific Time, April 29, 2016",0

The woman, deputies say, let Reese take her bedroom while she slept in the living room. Around 12:55 a.m. Saturday, Reese is accused of waking the woman up and forcibly pulling her into the bedroom where deputies say he proceeded to sexually assault her.

If someone calls you asking for money, call your local Police Department and check with us before you become a victim, Sheehan said.

1787,"The Fairfax County Police Department has decided not to release the name of the police officer who fatally shot a man in a barricade/hostage situation in Reston earlier this month -- at least not yet. While county policy is to release the name of an officer involved in a fatal shooting within 10 days unless the department can articulate risk to that officer, there are several factors at play that are causing police to withhold the officers name for the time being, Roessler said in a statement Thursday. Because of the complexity of the investigation, Im not in a position at this point to say whether a risk exists or not, therefore, it isnt prudent to release the officers name at this time, he said. Roessler added that he expects an update on the assessment in the near future. The involved officer remains on administrative leave until the investigation is complete. Fairfax County Police identified 32-year-old Mohammad Azim Doudzai as the suspect in a double-shooting and barricade in Herndon on Jan. 16 that ended in his death. Police were called to a house in the 13300 block of Covered Wagon Lane at around 2:40 p.m. on that date to a report of two men who had been shot. Once on the scene, they found that a man was inside armed with a gun, and set up a perimeter to isolate the area, according to a report from the Fairfax County Police Department. Police tweeted Tuesday morning that Doudzai was a suspect, but noted that he was not yet confirmed as the shooter. Preliminarily, our investigation reveals the suspect fired several shots and started a fire, both inside the home, the report states. Officers set up a perimeter, isolated the area and began evacuating neighbors. Members of the Crisis Negotiations Team and SWAT were called to assist. They made several attempts to negotiate with the suspect and have him voluntarily surrender. During the ordeal, officers learned another man was trapped inside and couldnt escape. As smoke inundated the house and billowed out the windows, officers heard repeated gunshots, the report continues. Officers also observed the suspect holding and moving around with at least one knife. Out of concern for the hostage and the suspect, officers made the decision to approach the home. When they approached the front door, the suspect stepped outside armed with a knife and then lunged at officers, prompting them to open fire. Officers immediately started rendering aid to the man after shooting him, but he was pronounced dead after being taken to the hospital. Both shooting victims are expected to survive, and the hostage was quickly rescued from the home. No one else was injured during the incident. Detectives will continue their investigation to piece together a chronological sequence of events and determine the exact relationship between the victims and the suspect, the report notes. Police ask that anyone with information call 703-691-2131. Image via FCPD",1

1789,"A Hyattsville woman says shes certain her cousin, a convicted sex offender, kidnapped two missing Montgomery County sisters from a Wheaton mall four decades ago and killed them, and she flatly denied that her father had a role in the disappearances. Patricia Ann Welch, 49, in a media interview this week, said that given his incarceration for other sex offenses, shes confident her cousin, Lloyd Lee Michael Welch Jr., murdered sisters Sheila Lyon, 12, and Katherine Lyon, 10. The girls were last seen walking home from the mall in March 1975. Their bodies have never been found. Prosecutors in Montgomery County have charged Lloyd Welch, who is locked up in a Delaware prison, with the first-degree felony murder of the girls. Welch is scheduled to go on trial for the sisters murders on Oct. 18 in Bedford County, Virginia. Yes, he did it, I think he did it 100 percent, Patricia Welch told WTOP and The Washington Post of the charge against her cousin. Lloyd has done it to other people, thats what hes in jail for. Lloyd has molested other kids. I think hes implicating my dad because hes the only one left alive. Montgomery County authorities believe the girls were taken to Taylors Mountain in the rural Virginia county – where relatives of Welch live and own land – and their bodies burned and hidden. Investigators have repeatedly said they suspect Lloyd Welchs relatives of knowing about his actions or those of his uncle, Richard Allen Welch Sr. of Hyattsville. The elder Welch has denied any wrongdoing in the case, and his daughter repeated her opinion that her father is innocent this week. She said that several extended family members who live in the Bedford County, Virginia, area have lied to the grand jury. A conspiracy to hide the fate of the Lyon sisters was formed in 1975 when relatives at Taylors Mountain failed to report what happened, she said. In February 2015, investigators said they believed the girls were taken by the convicted sex offender and later sexually assaulted by his uncle, Richard Welch, according to court documents. Patricia Welch said there is no way her father abused the sisters; she would have been 8 years old at the time the Lyon girls were taken and told WTOP she saw nothing amiss in her family home. Investigators have searched for traces of the sisters in Bedford County. The area is the one-time home for both Welch men, authorities said. Prosecutors in both Maryland and Virginia, as well as Montgomery County Police, declined to comment on Patricia Welchs statements. READ ALSO: Family Members Cross Investigators Several of Patricia Welchs family members have been prosecuted for hindering the murder investigation. Leslie Joseph Engleking Sr., 69, of Alexandria, Virginia, in February pleaded no-contest to lying to police searching for the Lyon sisters. Engleking was sentenced last month to five years in prison for lying to the grand jury, but the entire sentence was suspended in favor of supervised probation. Authorities say since his arrest for perjury, Engleking has cooperated in the investigation. Along with Engleking, two other Richard Welch family members were charged with impeding the investigation into the sisters deaths. Gladys Stangee and Amy Johnson were charged with obstruction of justice. Stangee is Richard Welchs sister, and Johnson is his granddaughter. Pursuing All Leads Prosecutors said at a July 2015 press conference that the charge filed against Lloyd Welch includes the allegation that during his abduction of the sisters with the intent to defile them, he killed the girls. John McCarthy, the states attorney from Montgomery County, has pledged to continue to pursue anyone who harmed the girls, and those who have lied and misled investigators. Life was never the same for any parent who tried to raise a child after the disappearance of these little girls. Weve never forgotten the Lyon family or the Lyon girls, McCarthy said last summer. Capt. Darren Franke, head of the Major Crimes Unit of the Montgomery County Police, urged witnesses to come forward. I believe theres someone out there that knows a lot more than theyve shared so far, Franke said. If people have a lead, they can call (434) 534-9521 or email cybertip@ncmec.org. Timeline of Girls Disappearance The girls walked to Wheaton Plaza (now Westfield Wheaton Mall) on March 25, 1975, but never returned home, Patch previously reported. The Washington Post cited documents that say Lloyd Welch told detectives he took the girls when he left the mall the day they disappeared, and that he later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the sisters at his home in Hyattsville. Police named Lloyd Welch a person of interest in connection with the kidnapping of the Lyon sisters in February 2014. Welch, who was charged with sex offenses against girls in several states, has been in a Delaware prison since 1997, according to police. Montgomery County Police said that Welch was noticed paying attention to the sisters the afternoon they disappeared. His uncle was named a second person of interest in the abductions in October 2014. The elder Welch was a security guard in the Wheaton area during the time of the sisters disappearance, Patch previously reported. In an earlier letter to the Post, Lloyd Welch denied any involvement in the disappearance of the sisters. Richard Welchs daughter told the newspaper the allegations are a lie. Anyone with information about the case is asked to call Montgomery County Police at 240-773-5070. »Photo of Lyon sisters from Montgomery County Police",1

1791,"The FBI is trying to locate a missing Santa Ana man who was kidnapped from San Gabriel Valley one month ago, officials reported Monday. Ruochen Tony Liao, 28, is a Chinese citizen employed by a luxury car dealership in Costa Mesa, FBI investigators reported in a press conference. It is believed that he might have been involved in business dealings that were not the most reputable, according to the FBI. He was possibly lured to a San Gabriel Valley shopping center in July on business, FBI special agent Gene Kowel said. A man known only as David is possibly involved, or may know Liaos whereabouts, according to Kowel. David is approximately 6 feet tall, speaks Mandarin, and is somewhere between 35- and 40-years-old, according to the FBI. David was reportedly one of three men last seen with Liao on July 16 when he was seen entering a dark minivan at about 7:30 p.m. Three unidentified men were in the van, all of Chinese ethnicity, Kowel said, in the area of 140 W. Valley Blvd. Our hope is that Tony is still alive, Kowel said. The FBI is aware of the general location Liao is being kept, and they do not believe he has been harmed. The FBI has released a reward of $25,000 for information leading to the recovery of Liao, they said. Liaos family has said that they are also offering $150,000 for information leading to his return, the family attorney Matthew Lomard said, adding, He is deeply loved by his family and theyre hoping for his safe return.

1795,"Prosecutors will seek the death penalty against the man and woman they say murdered then dismembered a 14-year-old girl from Montgomery County last July. The announcement was made Friday in Bucks County court, when Jacob Sullivan, 44, waived his formal arraignment on charges he killed and raped his girlfriends daughter, Grace Packer. His girlfriend, Sara Packer, is also charged with her adopted daughters murder. Prosecutors have already signaled theyll seek the death penalty against her, according to multiple reports. The pair was charged in January, six months after authorities say they beat, raped and poisoned the girl before strangling her in Richland Township over an 18-hour period. Packer and Sullivan then preserved the girls corpse for weeks in cat litter before dismembering and dumping it in a remote area of north central Pennsylvania, according to the Bucks County District Attorney.

1799,"Three men with reputed ties to the Latin American MS 13 gang were indicted by a federal grand jury this week for a kidnapping conspiracy that used Facebook chats to lured a man from New Jersey to Maryland, in order to kill the victim as part of a plan to kill him in Montgomery County, authorities say. The victims remains were found Nov. 12, 2016, in a shallow grave in the Gaithersburg area, roughly a month after he was reported missing. The suspects are charged in the murder of Jordy Mejia, 22, of Guttenberg, New Jersey. Mejias body was found by hikers in a shallow grave in a wooded area in the 11500 block of Game Preserve Road. Montgomery County Police released photos of the shirt and shoes similar to the ones the victim was wearing when his body was found, which helped identify Mejia. Authorities have not said how Mejia died. The indictment returned on March 20 charges these suspects: This indictment alleges a horrifically planned effort to lure a victim across multiple states into Maryland with the sole purpose of kidnapping and inflicting grotesque bodily harm, said Andre R. Watson, Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations Baltimore, in a news release. HSI will continue to use its wide jurisdictional authorities and collaborate with state and local law enforcement to ensure that we shield Maryland-area communities from this type of violent criminal activity. According to the indictment, on October 1, 2016, Moreno created a social media account in the name of Shaila Smith. For the next two weeks, Moreno and others posed as Shaila Smith and used the Facebook account to communicate with the victim. Pretending to be Shaila Smith, Moreno and the other suspects allegedly expressed a romantic interest in Mejia and persuaded the victim to travel from New Jersey to Maryland to meet in person. He was given Melendez-Riveras address as the location where he should meet Shaila Smith. Authorities say Moreno traveled from New Jersey to Maryland on Oct. 15, 2016, in order to kill the victim. According to the indictment, Moreno, Melendez-Rivera and Granados-Vasquez killed Mejia that day in a wooded area in Gaithersburg and buried his body in a shallow grave. The defendants each face a maximum sentence of life in prison for the conspiracy. Police also arrested Jackelin Leiba-Esperanza, 16, of Brentwood, Maryland, on Jan. 2 in Silver Spring, and charged her as an adult with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. She is being held without bond. Another suspects arrested Jan. 4 in Montgomery County and charged with Mejias murder is Katerine Solorzano-Aparicio, 17, of Hyattsville. She is also charged as an adult with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Mejias murder appears to be connected to the MS-13 street gang, police said. Prosecutors said in court that Moreno and Leiba-Esperanza are extreme flight risks because they are recent immigrants who are in the country illegally. Leiba-Esperanza and her mother had fled violence in El Salvador, The Washington Post reports. According to charging documents, on Oct. 15, Mejia told his mother he was going to Maryland to see a girl he had met on Facebook, and he planned to return the next day. The charging documents say Mejias Facebook account showed long talks with someone identifying themselves as Shaila Smith. Three days after Mejia left for Maryland, his mother filed a missing person report when she had not heard from him. Police say the Facebook conversation showed Mejia was lured to Germantown to meet the fictitious girl. Mejia arrived in Montgomery County, where he was killed and buried. Authorities have not said what the motive for the murder was beyond a link to gang activities. A phone number the person gave Mejia, along with phone records, led police to Moreno, who was living with Leiba-Esperanza for several months, WTOP reports. »Shutterstock image",1
1800,"The New York Attorney General announced the arrest of three men for an elaborate phone extortion scheme that was run upstate, but targeted residents in Nassau County. According to Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood, Giovani Ayala-Rodriguez, a.k.a. George Peters, 27, of Puerto Rico, and co-conspirators Eligio Jimenez-Correa, 40, and Orlando Gonzalez-Rivera, 26, both of Syracuse, were arrested for the scheme that operated in Onondaga and targeted people in counties throughout New York. As we allege, the defendants engaged in a shameful scheme to terrorize and rob New Yorkers, said Underwood. Todays takedown should send an unmistakable message to those who seek to extort New Yorkers: you will not get away with it. The investigation identified more 55 victims in Onondaga, Kings, Nassau, Oneida, Madison, Oswego, Cayuga, Niagara, Cortland, and Genesee counties. After multiple complaints from victims who received telephone calls from a person claiming to have kidnapped or otherwise detained their family members, the New York State Police and the Attorney Generals office opened an investigation. According to Underwood, Ayala-Rodriguez, the alleged ringleader of the scheme, called victims and claimed that their close relatives were in a car accident that resulted in injury to his nephew. Ayala-Rodriguez would say he had taken the victims sibling, spouse or parent from the accident scene to a nearby residence, Underwood said. During the conversation, Underwood said that Ayala-Rodriguez would demand money from the victim, claiming that his injured relative did not have any insurance to pay related bills. Ayala-Rodriguez would threaten physically harm to the victims family members if a ransom was not paid, said Underwood. To further instill fear and compliance with his demands, Underwood said, Ayala-Rodriguez claimed that he was a drug dealer and/or gang member. When victims hesitated to comply, Underwood said that Ayala-Rodriguez threatened to shoot their relatives. According to prosecutors, some victims were directed to pay the ransom money by following a series of instructions to deliver the money to specific locations in the City of Syracuse. In other instances, victims were allegedly directed to pay ransom money using various forms of wire transfers to specific accounts in the United States and/or Puerto Rico, including Walmart-to-Walmart transfers. According to prosecutors, Jimenez-Correa and Orlando-Rivera participated in the scheme by picking up the money. Our investigation uncovered a ruthless scheme designed to extort money from the victims through fear and intimidation, and this type of criminal activity simply will not be tolerated, said New York State Police Superintendent George Beach. I commend our Special Investigations Unit and our partners at the Attorney Generals Office for their hard work to hold these suspects accountable for their actions, and deliver justice for their victims. After paying the ransom money, prosecutors said that victims were directed to area hospitals to pick up their relatives, only to learn that they were the victims of a hoax, and that their relatives had never been in car accidents or abducted. Ayala-Rodriguez is charged with three counts of second-degree grand larceny, three counts of attempted second-degree grand larceny, three counts of first-degree coercion and one count of fourth-degree conspiracy. Jimenez-Correa is charged with two counts of second-degree grand larceny, once count of attempted second-degree grand larceny, two counts of first-degree coercion and one count of fourth-degree conspiracy. Gonzalez-Rivera is charged with one count of second-degree grand larceny, one count of attempted second-degree grand larceny, one count of first-degree coercion and one count of fourth-degree conspiracy. If convicted of all counts, Ayala-Rodriguez and Jimenez-Correa face up to 10 to 20 years in prison; Gonzalez-Rivera faces up to 7 1/3 to 20 years in prison. Photo: Sebastian Duda/Shutterstock",0

The pair claimed they left the library and went roughly three blocks away to Monterey High School, where they reported the alleged encounter to a campus staff employee, according to police. Investigators began looking for a middle-aged Hispanic man with white, shoulder length hair and a white beard, a rose tattoo on his neck and wearing rings and bracelets on both hands.

1804,"A police pursuit led Monday to a crash and officer- involved shooting that left the suspect -- who is believed to be the man wanted in connection with a series of recent crimes -- wounded on the northbound Golden State (5) Freeway in Sun Valley. The pursuit began about 3:30 p.m. in the 1800 block of Foothill Boulevard, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The chase ended a short time later in a crash on the northbound 5 at Glenoaks Boulevard. The suspect jumped out of his car and tried to run, but was wounded in an officer-involved shooting. It was not immediately clear if the suspect was armed or fired at officers. Paramedics treated several people -- including children -- who were in the vehicle that was struck by the suspect. Details on their conditions were not immediately available. Multiple media outlets reported that the suspect was Artyom Gasparyan, who was being sought in connection with a series of violent crimes across the Southland over the past month. Police did not immediately confirm the mans identity, although a spokesman said the chase began when the suspect was recognized by officers. The 5 Freeway is expected to remain closed for several hours. Police over the weekend reached out to the public for help tracking down Gasparyan, 32, saying he is wanted on suspicion of murder, attempted murder, carjacking and robbery in crimes committed across the area, stretching from Burbank to Long Beach to West Hollywood to Carson and Panorama City. Most recently, Gasparyan was tied to a police pursuit that began near the Harbor Gateway area and ended when a second suspect, Daniel Ramirez, shot himself in the head at a Long Beach home in the 3300 block of Daisy Avenue after shooting two men and stabbing another. Ramirez died Saturday at a hospital, and police identified him as a Gasparyan accomplice. Police said Gasparyans crimes date back to a Dec. 9 shooting in Burbank, where a 67-year-old man was shot multiple times at his home and a 33- year-old gardener was wounded. On Dec. 30, Gasparyan allegedly was involved in the shooting death of a 37-year-old man near Van Nuys Boulevard and Plummer Street that was initially reported as a road rage incident. Officers found the victim lying near a car and took him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police also believe Gasparyan is linked to shootings in the Panorama City area on Dec. 30 that left three people wounded. The Long Beach pursuit began when Gasparyan and Ramirez allegedly stole a Volkswagen Passat on New Years Day and then led police on a high-speed chase through the Carson area, police said. At 9:30 a.m. on New Years Day, an off-duty Los Angeles police officer spotted the Passat at 182nd and Vermont Avenue, which had been involved in another crime earlier that morning, said Sgt. Bradley Hearn of the LAPDs Harbor station. Other officers then spotted the Passat near 223rd Street and Vermont Avenue, and a pursuit began, Hearn said. During the pursuit, one of the suspects fired at the occupants of an orange Dodge Durango that pulled over when the driver heard the patrol cars sirens, Hearn said. They were not injured. Ramirez eventually ran into the house on Daisy Avenue, police said. Ramirez allegedly fought with a man inside the house and stabbed him in the face with a knife from the kitchen. The man and a younger son, who suffered injuries to his hands, were able to flee. Ramirez allegedly held the remaining two sons in the house as hostages, eventually shooting them both, police said. Both survived. As police approached the home, Ramirez shot himself in the head, Hearn said. --City News Service, photo via LAPD",0

1806,"Larry Pratt of Decatur has been sentenced to 17 years in prison for his part in a robbery crew that impersonated police officers and robbed suspected drug dealers in several counties, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. The crew committed robberies in Rockdale, Fulton, Bartow and Cobb Counties, federal officials said. In many cases, the suspects trailed the alleged drug dealers to their houses, then broke in dressed as police. Once inside a victims house, the robbers tied up the inhabitants and beat them until they told the robbers where to find drugs and money. By impersonating police and invading houses in residential areas, this robbery crew undermined the publics trust in real law enforcement officers, said United States Attorney Sally Quillian Yates. Citizens must be able to trust that those who look like police are, in fact, really police. Although it may be tempting to characterize this as merely drug dealer on drug dealer crime, the fact that this robbery crew also used SWAT-like tactics, kidnapped victims, and exchanged gunfire on residential streets to steal drugs and cash demonstrates a lack of respect for peoples lives. According to testimony and court documents, Pratt and the five other men indicted with him by the Fulton County District Attorneys Office belonged to a robbery crew that used tracking devices they secretly put on the victims cars to learn their habits and where their intended victims stored drugs and money. The armed robbers would dress like police, including wearing bullet-proof vests, raid jackets, and hats with the word POLICE printed on them. They would then storm the victims houses yelling Police, get down and then tie up and beat the victims until they provided the location of the drugs and money. In a Jan. 14, 2010 robbery, authorities said Pratt and nine other robbers targeted a residence in DeKalb County. Dressed as police, the group rushed a victim walking out of his house, and handcuffed him on the front lawn and shot at the victims friend as he drove up to the house. A gunfight between the friend and the robbers took place in the front yard. The robbers then kidnapped the victim in order to get him to divulge where the drugs were located; they drove the victim around for several hours, and he was certain he would be killed. Prosecutors said the ordeal ended only when the robbers drove the victim to his residence in Conyers, and his girlfriend called police. Pratt, 40, was sentenced to 17 years in prison, and five years of supervised release. He pleaded guilty on Nov. 10, 2011, and his sentencing was delayed until after the trial of his co-defendants. One other member of the crew, Ryan Whitt of Decatur, was sentenced in January to 16 years in prison. Two members of the crew are from Atlanta: Charles Hutcheson, aka Charlie Boy, who was sentenced to 19 years, six months in prison, and Taylor Richardson, who is scheduled to be sentenced on April 15.",1
1807,"The gunman who opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando where at least 50 people have died and dozens others injured was identified by the FBI as Omar Saddiqui Mateen, a U.S. citizen who was born in New York to Afghan parents, officials said. Mateen, of Port St. Lucie, Florida, was killed by law enforcement in an exchange of gunfire. An officer initially responded to a shots fired call at the club where he engaged the shooter outside the club. The man ran back inside Pulse, shot many of those in the bar, and a hostage situation began. Following the shooting, the NYPD said there are no current threats to New York City. However, NYPD counterterrorism units have deployed additional resources across the city, especially at LGBT facilities. Weve selected locations in the downtown area like the Stonewall and the vicinity, said James Waters, the NYPDs head of counter-terrorism operations. We will be moving from place to place and moving our resources around. In MySpace photos posted online, Mateek is seen wearing an NYPD shirt. NYPD Chief of Department James ONeill said he had no connections with the NYPD and he could have obtained the shirts from anywhere in the United States. Mayor Bill de Blasio has ordered all flags in the city to be flown at half-staff. In addition, City Hall and the lights on the One World Trade centers spire will be lit in rainbow colors to represent LGBT pride. The Empire State Building will stay dark.

A separate vigil is planned at the inn Monday evening. Click here for a link of other vigils planned in the city, courtesy Gay City News. Mateen reportedly called 911 before the shooting and pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State. He had been interviewed by FBI officials in the past for possible links to Islamic extremism but no conclusive evidence was found. The shooting took place during Pride Month at Pulse Orlando Night Club & Ultra Lounge. Pulse was founded in 2004 by Barbara Poma and Ron Legler. Poma opened the club in honor of her brother John, who died in 1991 after battling HIV for several years, according to the club website.

1810,"- The Essex County District Attorneys office issued an arrest warrant for Brian Chevalier, 51, of Merrimack, NH, on murder charges. Chevalier was arrested and being held in Imperial County, CA, where he will appear in court Monday on a fugitive from justice charge. Chevalier is accused of murdering 49-year-old Wendi Rose Davidson, who was strangled and found Saturday in the basement of her North Andover home. Mondays hearing and whether finds extradition will determine how quickly he is returned to Massachusetts. Chevalier was arrested on a New Hampshire parole violation charge and a Massachusetts larceny charge, according to Essex County DA Spokeswoman Carrie Kimball Monahan. A preliminary investigation suggests Davidson was strangled. They also said that Davdisons death did not appear to be a random act. Davidson and Chevalier had gotten engaged on Valentines Day. But a friend of Wendi Davidson said that engagement had been broken off earlier this month. Davidsons funeral was scheduled for Friday morning in Tewksbury. The murder investigation started after Davidsons body was discovered by a neighbor on Saturday morning at 50 Lincoln Street. Investigators executed search warrants on the victims apartment and motor vehicle, which was located at Choice Fitness, a short distance away from her home. Police were called to a residence at 50 Lincoln Street at 12:28 pm Saturday by the womans brother. Another woman who lived at 50 Lincoln Street had alerted Davidsons brother after finding her body in the basement of the multi-unit home. Chevalier Was Released From Prison In December  In 2004 a jury convicted Chevalier of kidnapping. On December 29, 2003, a 33-year-old Jaffrey, NH woman came home from work to find Chevalier waiting for her. Chevalier, according to court records, attacked her and forced her into the bedroom. He then beat her, repeatedly sexually assaulted her and threatened to kill her. For most of the next 21 hours, Chevalier kept her duct taped to the bed. Police said at one point Chevalier choked the woman until she passed out and told her he would kill her and leave her body in a freezer in the basement of her house. The woman said he also tried to force her to buy plane tickets to California, saying he planned to flee there after he killed her. At the time of the attack, Chevalier was on parole after serving a previous prison sentence for burglary. That sentence was extended when he attacked another inmate. During the 21-hour assault, Chevalier called his parole officer to tell him he would not be at the home in Merrimack, NH he shared with his mother that night because they had had an argument. The victim said Chevalier was drunk for most of the time she was held captive. When he sobered up, she said, he pleaded with her to not tell police because he did not want to go back to jail. At 2:30 pm the next day he had the woman drive him to Blake Street in Jaffrey, where he had parked his vehicle. The woman immediately reported the attack to police, who arrested Chevalier later that night at his home in Merrimack, NH and charged him with kidnapping, burglary, criminal threatening, reckless conduct and three counts of aggravated sexual assault. The victim had dated Chevalier for about three months in 2003 but tried to break up with him him after a violent incident on December 19, 2003, according to court records. In 2006, the State of New Hampshire Supreme Court denied Chevaliers appeal of his conviction. Chevalier argued the trial court erred when it denied his request to preserve a copy of the hard drive of the victims computer to determine whether it contained exculpatory evidence. Chevalier had argued that the hard drive may have shown evidence of a previous interest in sexual bondage by his victim, which would have bolstered his argument that the sex and restraint was consensual. Even if we assume that the victims computer might have contained materials related to sexual bondage, their presence was irrelevant to whether the victim consented to engage in this activity with the defendant on the night in question, the court wrote in its opinion. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courts ruling.New Hampshire Corrections records show that Chevalier is no longer in custody. The earliest he could have been released, according to parole records, was December 14, 2017. Had be served his full sentence, Chevalier would have been released in December, 2037. Engagement Had Been Broken Off While Davidsons profile still said the couple was engaged at the time of her death, Chevaliers profile said he was single. Earlier this month he had begun asking for friends on Facebook if they knew of an apartment for rent in New Hampshire. Davidson had two sons, one who lives in Tewksbury and one who lives in Danvers. She moved to North Andover four years ago and worked as a staff accountant at AHA Consulting and Engineering company in Lexington. Davidson grew up in Malden and Stoneham and graduated from Stoneham High School in 1987. Her father and step mother live in Tewksbury. She was the type of person who didnt want people worrying about her, the friend said. No matter how bad her problems were, shed downplay it and ask what she could do to help you with your problem.

1818,"Santa Clara County, CA -- A Santa Clara County Superior Court judge denied a request Monday to delay the trial of a man facing charges in the disappearance of a 15-year-old girl outside Morgan Hill more than four years ago. Attorneys for 25-year-old Antolin Garcia-Torres, whos charged with the kidnapping and murder of 15-year-old Sierra LaMar, had requested his trial be delayed to Oct. 10. Superior Court Judge Vanessa Zecher denied the defenses motion to postpone the trial during a hearing at the Hall of Justice in San Jose this morning. The request wasnt granted based on the length of the time the case has been pending and that there are three attorneys representing Garcia-Torres who are capable of working out any issues in preparation for the trial. Zecher tentatively scheduled certain motions, which include a request for a change of venue, to be filed or heard by the end of the month and jury selection to begin the week of Sept. 19. There will be breaks in the trial on the weeks of Nov. 21 and Dec. 19 for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, respectively, the judge said. Sierra was last seen on March 16, 2012, leaving her home in unincorporated Morgan Hill and wasnt on her bus for school. Her body hasnt been recovered, but investigators found her cellphone and Juicy-brand purse with her clothes folded inside days after she went missing miles away from her home. Garcia-Torres was arrested in connection with Sierras disappearance about two months later when investigators found her DNA in his red Volkswagen Jetta. One of the defense attorneys for Garcia-Torres is Alphonso Lopez, who said he will be more focused on Garcia-Torres case once he takes a two-week vacation after a jury reaches a verdict in another trial hes been working on. The defendant wants his trial to move forward, but also agreed to the delay, Lopez said. Defense attorney Brian Matthews added that there is a large amount of dense material to review that include transcripts and thousands of documents. There have also been CDs hes received from prosecutors that dont work, Matthews said. Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney David Boyd said Sierras cellphone was sent to its manufacturer in South Korea for analysis last month and attorneys for both sides still need to review the report that recently returned. In a brief address to the court this morning, Sierras father Steve LaMar said his family has been patient with the slow progression of the case and requested the trial move forward as soon as possible. Steve LaMar was with a group of nearly a dozen people, including Sierras mother, aunts, uncles and supporters in the courtroom. Many of them wore pins with the 15-year-old girls picture. After todays hearing, Steve LaMar said he wasnt completely satisfied with the tentative jury selection date, but was glad to be at todays hearing and see the case slowly proceeding. We want answers. Weve wanted answers since 2012, Steve LaMar said. The attorneys were scheduled to return to court this afternoon for a hearing on a motion to suppress evidence. --Bay City News.

1819,"The preliminary hearing for German national Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter--charged with the 1985 San Marino murder of his landlords son John Sohus--will take place Jan. 18, 2012, a judge ruled Monday morning in Alhambra Superior Court. Defense attorney Brad Bailey told Patch Monday that he estimates the hearing will last six days. During the preliminary hearing the prosecution presents evidence and the judge decides if enough exists for the case to go to trial. The defense previously said they expect the case to go to trial. Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian requested the date aloud in the courtroom Monday and defense attorneys Brad Bailey, Jeffrey Denner and Kenneth Kahn agreed, as did Gerhartsreiter, to the hearing date. When the judge asked Gerhartsreiter if he understood the preliminary hearing will take place on Jan. 18 or within two days of that date, he also answered in the affirmative. Attorneys on both sides said they do not anticipate any further preliminary hearing delays. I think itll be an interesting hearing and Im looking forward to it, Denner told Patch Monday. Denner also said that the defense has so far reviewed 7,000 of the 11,000 pages of discovery for the case. Several DVDs and video tapes have also been disclosed. Gerhartsreiters preliminary hearing date was delayed twice and the . Preliminary setting dates can go for a while—it depends on how much time his team has or wants to get ready, Los Angeles District Attorney Spokeswoman Jane Robison told Patch in August. Gerhartsreiter went by the alias of fictional royal descendant Christopher Chichester when he lived in a San Marino guesthouse on Lorain Road in the 1980s. He quietly left San Marino shortly after Sohus and his wife Linda disappeared. After flying under the radar for two decades in other states and under various aliases, including his final alias of Clark Rockefeller, a fake member of the famed Rockefeller family, Gerhartsreiter was convicted in 2009 of kidnapping his young daughter Snooks during a supervised visit. When police discovered at the time of the kidnapping that Clark Rockefeller was not who he claimed to be and in fact had no identification or bank account, they investigated further and found he was Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, a man whose Christopher Chichester alias was wanted for questioning in the 1985 Sohus murder.

1820,"Chatham Township and Borough are currently home to a total of four registered sex offenders, according to the Morris County Prosecutors Office. Through an Open Public Records Act request, Patch obtained town-by-town statistics regarding the number of registered sex offenders residing in each Morris County municipality, now 20 years after a landmark bill was signed into law. The county, with a total of 292 registered sex offenders, is led by Dover with 41.  The township and borough each have two registered sex offenders and combine for more than 19,000 in population. Numbers varied by county throughout the state, with Essex leading all 21 counties claiming 522 registered sex offenders as residents. Morris County is in the top half of the states counties, ranking fifth overall. According to the New Jersey State Police, Hunterdon County has the least number of registered sex offenders with just 27. On Oct. 31, 1994, sex offender registration and community notification provisions were signed into law under the name of Megans Law. Less than seven years later, on July 23, 2001, that law expanded and became required for registration on the Internet as well. Megans Law came about after Megan Kanka, a seven-year-old girl, was raped and murdered by a neighbor in Hamilton Township, Mercer County in July of 1994. That neighbor, Jesse Timmendequas, was previously convicted of sexually assaulting a five-year-old girl and seven-year-old girl. Timmendequas was convicted of first degree murder, kidnapping, and four aggravated sexual assault crimes of Kanka. He was sentenced to the death penalty, but reverted back to life in prison without parole after New Jersey abolished the death penalty in 2007 while he sat on death row.

The crimes include aggravated sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, kidnapping in conjunction with a sex crime, endangering the welfare of a child by engaging in sexual conduct, luring or enticing, and knowingly promoting prostitution of a child.

Upon arrival on Halesia Court officers learned that the two male suspects entered the home through an unlocked front door while the three occupants of the home were sleeping. The housebreakers restrained two women, police said. A man in another part of the house reportedly slept through the episode. Orland Park Police Cmdr. John Keating declined to say how the two women were restrained or to identify the weapons Adkins and the other man allegedly armed themselves with for the robbery. He did say neither man had a gun or a knife, and that they knew what they were coming for. The subsequent investigation by Orland Park Police determined that the Halesia Court residence was specifically targeted and not randomly chosen, the statement said. Adkins and the second man learned of the safe stuffed with cash and jewelry by word of mouth, Keating said. Somehow someone told somebody, he said. Adkins was identified as one of the robbers within days of the attack, police said. On Wednesday, the cops reportedly captured him while he was hiding out in an apartment on Oak Park Avenue. The two women picked him out of a lineup on Thursday. Adkins alleged accomplice remains at large but persons of interest have been identified, according to police.",1
1822,"A Hollywood man who kidnapped a 14-year-old boy from a San Fernando Valley street in 2001 and sexually assaulted him was sentenced Wednesday to 35 years to life in prison. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Hayden Zacky lashed out at the defendant, Mirek Paul Voyt, 55, saying the crime destroyed the life of the victim -- who was convicted five years later of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Voyt stole his innocence ... his chance to become a productive member of society, Zacky said. Because of this, he (the victim) went off the rails. He could have been a doctor. ... Well never know. Deputy District Attorney Julie Kramer said the victim in the case, now 31, was convicted of murder in 2006 when he was 19. A jury in San Fernando deliberated about 2 1/2 hours before finding Voyt guilty Jan. 11 of two felony counts -- one count of kidnapping to commit oral copulation and/or sodomy and one count of forcible oral copulation, Kramer said. Jurors also found true allegations of personal use of a firearm, aggravated kidnapping and tying and binding the victim, according to the prosecutor. Voyt was arrested Feb. 14, 2017, at his home after being linked through DNA evidence to the attack in Northridge. The teen was walking with another boy about 9:45 a.m. June 22, 2001, near the intersection of Chase Street and Vanalden Avenue when a man armed with a handgun confronted them, Los Angeles Police Department Capt. William Hayes said shortly after Voyts arrest. One of the boys managed to flee, but the other was kidnapped and sexually assaulted before he was released, the captain said. Voyt lived within a short distance of the intersection where the abduction occurred, and investigators said he took the boy to his home after abducting him and blindfolding him. At the time of his arrest, Voyt was working in a management position for a grocery store chain, and since 2001 has lived in various locations in the Los Angeles area, the captain said. This was a really tragic case, Zacky said during Wednesdays sentencing hearing. Mr. Voyt thought he got away with it. But due to the hard work and perseverance of the detectives, justice has been served. By FRED SHUSTER, City News Service",1

Brian Burns, 56, formerly a physician in Harrisburg, was convicted last year of trying to kidnap late Saline County States Attorney Mike Henshaw, who was prosecuting him on murder charges for allegedly killing his estranged wife, Carla, in March 2016, according to the Carbondale-based paper. In August 2016, Burns was caught on tape offering $1,000 in order to kidnap Henshaw and torture him until he agreed to drop charges and state publicly there was not enough evidence to keep the ex-doctor behind bars. During his May 2017 trial, the jury heard hours of audio from secretly recorded jailhouse conversations between the doctor and another prisoner. According to audio recordings made by Burns cellmate and obtained by the Southern, Burns expressed some concern about the plan. Youre not wearing a mic are you? You swear to God? Youre not setting me up are you? he said on the tapes. Burns told his cellmate he was afraid of becoming another [Drew] Peterson, the former Bolingbrook cop who got an extra 40 years added to his prison sentence for soliciting a hitman to kill the states attorney who prosecuted him for killing his third wife.  Henshaw, the prosecutor Burns targeted, died last May at the age of 72 following a fall down the stairs in his house, according to the county coroner and state police, the Southern reported. » Read more and listen to the recordings from the Southern Illinoisan Top photo via Saline County sheriffs office",0

1826,"A Thousand Oaks woman and an Oceanside man pleaded not guilty Thursday in the kidnapping and murder of a 3-week-old Long Beach girl and the attempted murders of the babys parents and uncle. Giseleangelique Rene DMilian, 48, and Anthony Ray McCall, 29, are charged in the Jan. 3 abduction and killing of Eliza De La Cruz, who was found dead in a trash bin in Imperial Beach in San Diego County the following day. The two are also charged, along with Todd Damon Boudreaux, 43, of Fontana, in the attempted murder of a 23-year-old woman and the attempted kidnapping on Feb. 6 of her 4-month-old son in an El Segundo hotel room. Long Beach police Chief Robert Luna alleged last month that DMilian and McCall came up with a plan to kidnap Eliza and pass her off as her (DMilians) own child. DMilian lied to her boyfriend last year, telling him she was pregnant with twins, according to the police chief. She later told him she had given birth to their twins in December while out of the country, but detectives determined that she had not given birth to any children in 2014, according to Luna. Authorities allege DMillian masterminded the kidnapping plot to secure two babies to continue the deception. Elizas mother was walking home with her infant daughter from a bus stop at Del Amo and Long Beach boulevards when a woman -- believed to be DMilian - - pulled up next to them in a black Range Rover and asked about her baby, Luna said. The police chief said the woman had a brief exchange with the mother, then drove away. He said detectives later determined that DMilian and McCall had both been following the bus Eliza and her mother were on, in separate vehicles. About 90 minutes after they got off the bus, McCall allegedly showed up at the De La Cruz home in the 100 block of West 51st Street, shot the three adults -- who all survived -- and abducted the baby. The reason baby Eliza was killed remains unknown, Luna said. Authorities have not disclosed how the baby was killed. About a month later, there was another attempt to steal a baby from a woman who was severely beaten in a hotel room in the 2000 block of East Mariposa Avenue in El Segundo, according to police. Her 4-month-old son was found inside the room and was not injured. McCall allegedly fled the scene after employees knocked on the hotel room door after being alerted by patrons about a female yelling for help, police said. Long Beach police said detectives determined that DMilian had known the woman for several years and was aware that she had recently given birth. The woman was targeted because of the childs age and DMilians knowledge about where to find her, police allege. Detectives believe DMilian misrepresented that she had a charitable organization aimed at helping young mothers and infants, and contacted friends and acquaintances in an effort to find infants. The three defendants were arrested March 25. DMilian and McCall are charged with one felony count each of murder, kidnapping and attempted kidnapping and four counts of attempted murder. The criminal complaint alleges that McCall personally and intentionally discharged a handgun during the Jan. 3 attack and personally used a bat during the attack in El Segundo, and that McCall personally inflicted great bodily injury on the four attempted murder victims. Boudreaux is charged with one felony count each of attempted murder and attempted kidnapping. OTHER PATCH HEADLINES City News Service Get Patched in! Sign up for free news alerts for your town.

1828,"--A news report from our sister Patch site at Camp Pendleton A Camp Pendleton Marine and two women were ordered Monday to stand trial on murder, torture and other charges stemming from the death of a military wife from Fallbrook, who authorities say was killed after being kidnapped and forced to participate in a bondage and sadomasochistic sex ring. After a six-day preliminary hearing, Vista Judge K. Michael Kirkman found that enough evidence was presented for Louis Ray Perez, 46, Dorothy Maraglino, 37, and 25-year-old Jessica Lynn Lopez to proceed to trial. In addition to murder and torture, the defendants are charged with conspiracy, attempted sexual battery and kidnapping. Brittany Killgores body was found near Lake Skinner last April 17, four days after the 22-year-old victim agreed to go on a dinner cruise with Perez. A deputy medical examiner testified that Killgore was strangled with some sort of ligature before being dumped near the Riverside County lake. The victim also had a deep cut from a saw below her left knee, suggesting attempted dismemberment after she died, Dr. Craig Nelson testified. Killgore had just filed for divorce from her Marine husband --  who was deployed to Afghanistan at the time -- and was preparing to move back to Pennsylvania. Lance Cpl. Cory Killgore was cleared of any wrongdoing in his wifes death. The victims best friend said she and Killgore became acquainted with the defendants in 2011 but never participated in their alternative lifestyle. Another friend testified that Killgore texted the word help shortly after leaving with Perez, who told the friend in a subsequent phone call that he dropped Killgore at a bar and saw her go off with two guys. Perez allegedly took Killgore to Maraglinos home in Fallbrook, where authorities said they found ropes, whips, a Taser, a nightstick, spiked gloves and a sex dungeon. All three defendants were involved in sexual behavior that included bondage, torture and master, servant and slave role-playing, and Killgore was an unwilling participant in those activities, sheriffs detective Susan Fiske alleged in search warrant affidavits. A document written by Maraglino and found during a search of her Fallbrook home indicated she was a willing participant in whipping, beating and asphyxiation and any loss of life should be considered an accident, sheriffs Detective Brian Patterson testified today. In another letter, Maraglino wrote of a fantasy in which a persons throat is slit from behind, Patterson testified. A status conference is scheduled Thursday in Kirkmans courtroom. -City News Service",1
1829,"A 15-year-old boy has been charged as an adult in the death of 8-year-old Madyson Maddy Middleton in Santa Cruz earlier this week, Santa Cruz District Attorney Jeff Rosell said today. Adrian Jerry Gonzalez was charged with murder, kidnapping and sexual assault, Rosell said during a news conference outside the Santa Cruz County Courthouse this morning. The murder charge includes special circumstances involving sexual assault, kidnapping and lying in wait, Rosell said. Gonzalez is being held at the Santa Cruz juvenile detention center and scheduled to be arraigned on Thursday, Rosell said. The death penalty is not applicable to juveniles, and the teen is facing life in prison if convicted on the charges, according to Rosell. Gonzalez and Maddy were acquaintances and neighbors who lived at a housing complex at the Tannery Arts Center campus at 1030 River St., police Chief Kevin Vogel said. Maddy was reported missing at 6:08 p.m. Sunday after she was seen an hour earlier playing with friends and riding her Razor scooter around the complex, Vogel said. An extensive search for the girl lasted into the night and for most of Monday with the help of the FBI, Santa Cruz County Sheriffs Office and other agencies, Vogel said. At 7:55 p.m. Monday, a Santa Cruz police detective found Maddys body concealed in a recycling bin in a first-floor garage at the complex, according to Vogel. Soon after the discovery, Gonzalez was found nearby, taken in by police for questioning and arrested on suspicion of homicide, Vogel said. The boy allegedly lured Maddy into his unit, where investigators suspect he was alone when he killed her, then placed her body in the recycling bin, the chief said. Gonzalez allegedly killed the girl before she was reported missing Sunday, according to Vogel. It appears Maddy willingly accompanied the suspect to his unit and had a reasonable amount of trust in him, Vogel said. Maddy was set to enter fourth grade next month at DeLaveaga Elementary School, Santa Cruz City Schools district superintendent Kris Munro said. We are stunned and deeply saddened in the wake of the tragic news about Maddy Middleton, Munro said in a statement on the districts website. Our hearts go out to her family, friends, and loved ones, many of whom are members of our school community as well as our larger community, Munro said. The district is offering counseling services today and Thursday at the school for students, families and staff, Munro said. The times for the counseling services and resources to cope with Maddys passing are posted on the districts website at http://www.sccs.santacruz.k12.ca.us.

Crews attorney said she wanted to take responsibility for her actions, but Crews didnt elaborate on how Greywind was killed. Crews could face life in prison.

1833,"The two suspects wanted in connection with a string of daytime door kick-in burglaries throughout Howard County were recently arrested in Bay County, Florida. Jopseh Leo Baumgarten and Dianna Lynn Marketti have been wanted by the Howard County Sheriffs Office since they skipped a bail hearing on Nov. 15. Marketti was arrested on an outstanding warrant after police responded to a verbal altercation between her and Baumgarten on Christmas, according to Springfield, FL Police. That day, Baumgarten fled the scene, said Springfield police, but he was later picked up on an outstanding warrant on Jan. 3 and charged with resisting an officer and providing a false name. Springfield is located on the Florida panhandle, just outside Panama City. Howard County Police are in the process of extraditing the two back to Maryland, according to the Howard County Sheriffs Office. The two were released on $15,000 bail each in October despite being charged with four daytime door kick-in burglaries around the county and suspected in at least 10 others, according to police. Baumgarten, 40, of Pasadena, and Marketti, 30, of Dundalk, were arrested by Howard County Police in October after being tracked down through stolen Ravens tickets and pawn shop videos, but were released on bail the next day. Afterward, a hearing was set to adjust their bail on Nov. 15, but neither of the two appeared at the hearing. Their arrest concludes a two-month search for the suspects by the Howard County Sheriffs Office that included hitting a dead end at an abandoned foreclosed home in Dundalk. Police reported Marketti drove a blue Chrysler PT Cruiser that was reportedly seen at the site of at least two of the door kick-in burglaries in the county. Baumgarten was recorded fencing what police said was merchandise stolen from the burglaries in pawnshop surveillance videos. The suspects were charged with allegedly stealing $22,000 in firearms, jewelry and electronics from four residences in Columbia, Ellicott City and Woodbine. After being released on bail, Marketti was allegedly attacked by Baumgarten in Baltimore in October. According to a Baltimore County police report, Baumgarten assaulted and kidnapped Marketti in the process of stealing her vehicle near Sparrows Point Country Club in Baltimore. Even before his alleged involvement in the burglaries, Baumgarten had an extensive record that included violating probation five times  after being convicted of burglary for offenses from 1996, 2002 and 2008, according to the Howard County states attorneys office. Marketti currently has 15 active traffic cases, most for driving on a suspended license, according to court records. We are glad they are back in custody, wrote police spokesperson Sherry Llewellyn in an email. In general terms, the police department supports the idea of the court system making it more challenging for repeat offenders to get back on the street, so they cannot victimize more people. The daytime door kick-in burglaries became so prevalent in September that police issued a warning asking residents to hide valuables after 10 residences in Columbia, Ellicott City, Clarksville, Elkridge and Woodbine were struck in a matter of three days. Police said the burglar would knock on a door and then, if unanswered, kick-in the door, go to the master bedroom, ransack it and steal valuables.

1837,"Hundreds of federal agents swarmed through the downtown Los Angeles Fashion District today, arresting nine people -- one from La Canada and seizing $65 million as part of a crackdown on what prosecutors called a sophisticated operation to launder money for Mexican drug cartels. The raids coincided with the unsealing of three federal indictments, one of which alleged that a Fashion District business was laundering ransom money payments made to secure the release of a U.S. citizen who was kidnapped and tortured in Mexico by the Sinaloa drug cartel. Federal prosecutors said other Fashion District stores were being used to launder money from drug traffickers and other offenders in what is known as a Black Market Peso Exchange scheme. Los Angeles has become the epicenter of narco-dollar money laundering with couriers regularly bringing duffel bags and suitcases full of cash to many businesses, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert E. Dugdale. Because Los Angeles is at the forefront of this money-laundering activity, law enforcement in Los Angeles is now at the forefront of combating this issue. Prosecutors said three people were arrested in connection with the alleged laundering of ransom money paid to the Sinaloa cartel. According to a federal indictment, a business called QT Fashion accepted bulk amounts of cash and funneled it through 17 other Fashion District businesses at the direction of a Mexico-based business called Maria Ferre S.A. de C.V. The $140,000 in ransom was paid by relatives of a U.S. citizen who was kidnapped by the Sinaloa cartel after U.S. authorities seized more than 100 kilograms of cocaine the man had been responsible for distributing. The man was taken to a ranch in Mexico, where he was beaten, shot, electrocuted and water- boarded, according to federal prosecutors. The man was released after the ransom was paid, officials said. Andrew Jong Hack Park, 56, of La Canada Flintridge; Sang Jun Park, 36, of La Crescenta; and Jose Isabel Gomez Arreoloa, 49, of Los Angeles; were arrested in connection with the QT Fashion case, according to prosecutors. Three other defendants named in the indictment -- all of Mexico -- remain at large. Three members of a Temple City family -- Xilin Chen, 55; his son, Chuang Feng Chen, 24; and his daughter, Aixia Chen, 28 -- were named in a second indictment accusing them of money laundering through Fashion District businesses called Yili Underwear and Gayima Underwear. Xilin Chen and Chuang Chen were both arrested this morning, but Aixia Chen remains at large. Four people connected to a business called Pacific Eurotex Corp. were named in a third indictment, accusing them of money-laundering. The indictment alleges the defendants used the company as a repository to receive bulk amounts of cash that they knew or believed to be drug money, and laundered the funds. Arrested in that case were Hersel Nemen, 55, of Beverly Hills, the companys CFO; Morad Neman, 54, of Westwood, the CEO; Mehran Khalili, 45, of Beverly Hills; and Alma Villalobos, 52, of Arleta. The Nemans are brothers, and Khalili is their brother-in-law, prosecutors said.

1840,"Local law enforcement say that abduction is rare, but simultaneously advocate parents of missing children to call the moment they know their child is missing. If you wait for 48 hours to call in a missing kid, thats 24 hours that have gone by that we havent been looking for them, said Marion Police Investigations Lieutenant Scott Elam. It is a gut feeling call for a parent. Thats because despite the fact that police say most missing children are soon found, there are cases like that of 12-year-old Johnny Gosch, where the child is never seen again. While local law enforcement said there are no missing children in Marion, the possibility of abduction — no matter how remote — begs the question: What usually happens when a child is reported missing and what can a parent do to help find them?  Law enforcement officials have said they see some patters to how many of these cases evolve. Young Kids Linn County Sheriff Brian Gardner said the search for the vast majority of calls for missing toddlers ends in the parents own home. We usually ask [parents] to search for the kids to look in the house, he said. Under the bead, in laundry baskets — the little ones have the darndest places to hide. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children advise parents to also look in piles of laundry, in and under beds, inside large appliances, and inside vehicles, including trunks—wherever a child may crawl or hide. Teens Marion Police Sgt. Lance Miller said the vast majority of missing persons cases — reported as frequently as one person per day in the Cedar Rapid/Iowa City corridor — are a result of runaways. Elam, his colleague, agrees. They are usually kids that have taken off from mom and dad, he said. They usually come back a day or two later. The West Branch Times reported in December last year that 17-year-old West Branch teen Brittany Safley-Prigge disappeared for after having a fight with her parents, in which they confiscated her cell phone. She was found four days later at her then-boyfriends home, 220 miles away in Goodview, MN. Her boyfriend, Angel Olvera, allegedly hid her in his basement for five days. What Can a Parent Do? But what are the options available to those that want to get help for a missing child? Two notification systems exist for parents of missing children in Marion: Operation Quickfind and the Iowa Amber Alert system. The Amber Alert is a collaboration between law enforcement and the press that notifies broadcast news providers on an abducted child, but only if the case meets these guidelines: Police have to confirm that the child is abducted, not just missing Law enforcement have reason to believe that the child is in serious danger of harm or death. The missing child has to be under 18 Theres enough information describing the missing child, the suspect or abductor to help potential viewers of the amber alert identify the people involved. But theres a less stringent set of requirements for an Operation Quickfind alert, a similar notification option available to Marion residents and many in the greater Cedar Rapids Metropolitan area. Residents reporting a missing person to police will be asked if they want to launch an operation quick find — usually if the person has been missing for less than 12 hours There doesnt necessarily need to be evidence of an abduction and theres no age requirement Making the Call Regardless of how children get lost, whether or not they ran away or have been taken, or even what may have happened prior to their disappearance, Sheriff Gardner said theres one crucial step parents have to make. Call the police. The whole goal is to get them home as soon as possible, he said. Regardless of whether they just wandered away from home or have been abducted.",1

1842,"An Albemarle County Grand Jury has returned two Indictments against Jesse Leroy Matthew, Jr. in connection with the Oct. 17, 2009 disappearance and death of Morgan Dana Harrington, according to a news release today from the Albemarle County Commonwealths Attorney. Matthew was charged with First Degree Murder of Morgan Harrington and Abduction with the Intent to Defile. The maximum penalty for each offense is life in prison. Harrington was a student at Virginia Tech and went missing after attending a concert in Charlottesville. Matthew, of Charlottesville, is also charged in the Hannah Graham case. Hannah, 18, a graduate of West Potomac High School was a student at UVA when she went missing Sept. 13, 2014 in Charlottesville. Her remains were found Oct. 18. To mark the one year anniversary Hannahs disappearance, friends and supporters gathered last weekend on the mall in Charlottesville to write messages of hope in her honor, according to Charlottesville media reports. Matthew was convicted this summer of attempted capital murder, abduction and sexual assault in a 2005 case involving a woman in Fairfax City. He is to be sentenced in that case on Oct. 2 and faces up to three life terms. These latest Indictments were received by the Court on Tuesday. An indictment is a charge and not evidence of guilt. A defendant is presumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial with the burden on the Commonwealth to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Matthew was served with the Indictments today. His first appearance before the Albemarle County Circuit Court will take place at 12:45 p.m. Wednesday, according to the county Commonwealths Attorney. The office gave a nod to law enforcement, stating that the indictments result from the dedicated investigative efforts over the past six years by the Virginia State Police, Albemarle County Police, Charlottesville Police, University of Virginia Police, and the FBI.",1
1843,"A man charged with abducting, sexually assaulting and murdering an 11-year-old girl on the largest American Indian reservation pleaded guilty Tuesday. More than a year after Ashlynne Mike was killed in Navajo Nation, Tom Begaye entered his new plea at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Albuquerque as family members of Mike cried. Sentencing will be held at a later date. Ashlynnes father, Gary Mike, said after the hearing that the case was like a roller coaster ride. Im glad this didnt go to trial, he said. (For more information on this and other neighborhood stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) Asked if he had a message for Begaye , Mike paused, tried to hold back tears and said, I cant now. Begaye lured the girl into his van in May 2016 and sexually assaulted her, prosecutors said. She was reported missing, but an Amber Alert didnt go out in the state until the next day. She was later found dead near the Arizona-New Mexico border. The Navajo Nation covers parts of those two states and Utah. The death led to pending federal legislation that would expand the Amber Alert system to tribal communities and calls for Navajo Nation to end its opposition to the death penalty. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona introduced legislation in April that would expand the notification system. He said more than 7,700 American Indian children are listed as missing in the U.S. Authorities say Begaye lured Mike and her brother into his van. The boy later told police the man took them deep into the desert then walked off with the girl and a tire iron before returning alone. Begaye told investigators he sexually assaulted the girl and hit her twice in the head with a crowbar, and that she was still moving when he left her in the desert, according to court documents. Her brother was able to escape. Begaye is from the small town of Waterflow near Lower Fruitland, where Mike lived with her father and siblings, according to the FBI. The town is near the reservation.  Navajo Nation, like many Native American tribes, outlaws the death penalty. Federal prosecutors are responsible for prosecuting homicides on tribal lands and rarely challenge tribal beliefs. Gary Mike said changing the tribal rule on the death penalty would be a decision for tribal elders. After his daughters death, Gary Mike filed a lawsuit against Navajo Nation for failing to have an emergency notification system that he says could have saved his daughters life. An Amber Alert system for the 27,000-square-mile reservation was proposed years ago but never implemented, despite the tribe having been awarded $330,000 in federal funding as part of a U.S. Justice Department pilot project. Half the money was used to buy equipment such as megaphones and pop-up tents, but the rest went unspent.

1844,"A man alleged to be the leader of the San Jose Chapter of the Vagos Outlaw Motorcycle Gang, as well as two other San Jose residents, were among 22 people arrested following what federal authorities told Patch was a a long-term criminal probe. A 45-page federal indictment was unsealed Friday afternoon, accusing those indicted of a conspiracy involving racketeering, murder, robbery, kidnapping and aggravated assault, among other charges, according to federal authorities. Warrants related to the case were served not only in San Jose but in Las Vegas, Reno, Beaumont, Pasadena, Moreno Valley, Fontana, Hollister, Granada Hills, Alhambra, Canyon Country and Oahu, Hawaii. Arrested from the Bay Area were: Ernesto Manuel Gonzalez, aka Romeo, of San Francisco, whom authorities allege is the sergeant-at-arms of the San Jose Vagos Chapter; Cesar Vaquera Morales, aka C, 49, of San Jose; and Diego Chavez Garcia, aka Boo, 34, of San Jose. The indictment alleges that the Vagos OMG is a highly organized criminal organization which adheres to a hierarchical chain of command, and whose members conspired to enrich the gang; to preserve, protect and enhance the power of the gang; and to keep victims in fear of the gang through acts and threats of violence. Among other alleged crimes, a 12-count superseding indictment charges eight Vagos OMG leaders and members, including alleged San Jose Chapter leader Gonzalez, on suspicion of the Sept. 23, 2011 murder of a member of the rival Hells Angels gang at the Nugget Hotel and Casino in Sparks, Nevada. The murder committed by Ernesto Gonzalez in the Nugget Casino was always a part of a larger criminal conspiracy, which has been made even more clear today, said Washoe County Nevada District Attorney Christopher Hicks. Prosecuting Gonzalez for his actions has been a priority for my office. As such, we welcomed the opportunity to work closely with federal authorities in this RICO investigation that not only seeks to hold Gonzales accountable but the entire involved Vagos criminal enterprise. In an email Friday to Patch, Department of Homeland Security Spokeswoman Lori Haley confirmed: Special agents and tactical personnel with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) and officers from a number of other state and local agencies executed federal search and arrest warrants at multiple locations throughout the Los Angeles area and in other jurisdictions this morning in conjunction with a long-term criminal probe. Its a significant investigation, she added. According to a U.S. Department of Justice news release, the 23 defendants charged for their alleged roles in the federal racketeering conspiracy and violent crimes in aid of racketeering offenses are: Pastor Fausto Palafox, a/k/a Ta Ta, 53, of Beaumont, Calif.; Albert Lopez, a/k/a Al, 39, of Canyon Country, Calif.; Albert Benjamin Perez, a/k/a Dragon Man, 57, of Santa Barbara, Calif.; James Patrick Gillespie, a/k/a Jimbo, 68, of Granada Hills, Calif.; Andrew Eloy Lozano, a/k/a Hulk, 42, of Fontana, Calif.; Ernesto Manuel Gonzalez, a/k/a Romeo, of San Francisco; Victor Adam Ramirez, a/k/a Slick, 35, of Las Vegas; James Walter Henderson, a/k/a CJ, 64, of Henderson, Nev.; Steven Earl Carr, a/k/a Big Steve, 43, of Las Vegas; Robert Allen Coleman, a/k/a Mayhem, 59, of Las Vegas; Jeremy John Halgat, a/k/a Maniak, 39, of North Las Vegas, Nev.; Paul Jeffrey Voll, a/k/a Shyster, 52, of Pasadena, Calif.; John Joseph Siemer, a/k/a Rocky, 60, of Baldwin Park, Calif.; Bradley Michael Campos, a/k/a Candy Man, 50, of Alhambra, Calif.; Cesar Vaquera Morales, a/k/a C, 49, of San Jose, Calif.; Diego Chavez Garcia, a/k/a Boo, 34, of San Jose, Calif.; Edward Claridan Chelby, a/k/a Recon, 57, of Kailua, Hawaii; Johnny Russell Neddenriep, a/k/a Johnny Bolts, 51, of Reno, Nev.; Darin Kieth Grieder, a/k/a Midget, 48, of Sparks, Nev.; Bert Wayne Davisson, a/k/a Flash, 45, of Sparks, Nev.; Mathew Keith Dunlap, a/k/a Big Mat, 46, of Sparks, Nev., and John Chrispin Juarez, a/k/a Quicky, 69, of Moreno Valley, Calif.

1850,">>News Alerts: Subscribe to a free email newsletter: BETHESDA •ROCKVILLE • SILVER SPRING  Numerous police agencies, along with both professional and volunteer search teams, will search parts of Montgomery County on Sunday, April 19, in an attempt to locate missing siblings Jacob and Sarah Hoggle. Montgomery County Police say the search is not based on any new investigative leads, but is part of the continued effort to locate the Hoggle children, who have been missing for more than seven months. Jacob Hoggle, 2, was last seen in the Darnestown area at about 4 p.m. on Sept. 7. Sarah Hoggle, 4, was last seen in the Clarksburg area about 9 p.m. on Sept. 7. Catherine Hoggle, the mentally ill Montgomery County mother who wont disclose the whereabouts of her two young children, remains in the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center. Hoggle says the children are safe, but has not given any information on their whereabouts.  Residents can expect to see law enforcement officers and volunteer search teams from various jurisdictions in parts of the county on Sunday. Members of this operation will be using canines, ATVs, and horses to aid in the ground search. Residents in the Darnestown, Boyds, and Clarskburg areas are asked to again search their property for any sign of Jacob and Sarah. Due to the active criminal investigation tied to the disappearance of the sibling, volunteers from the community cannot be used in this search, police say.  Familys Hopes vs. Police Homicide Case There are two theories on the fate of the children. Troy Turner, Hoggles common-law husband, and Lindsey Hoggle, their grandmother, believe the mentally ill mother gave the youngsters to someone to care for them. Montgomery County Police say they believe the children are dead, although no bodies have been found. In a March interview, Turner said Catherine knows that she was wrong to take the children, and he expects no help from her in finding Sarah and Jacob. This was a criminal act, not a mental break, Turner told Montgomery Community Media. I talk to her, I know her; and she knows what she was doing was wrong when she took them. She has mental health issues, but those issues arent the reason she did this. Doctors say Hoggle is not competent to stand trial on misdemeanor charges of child neglect, abduction and hindering a police investigation for her role in the childrens disappearance. The FindSarahFindJacob Facebook page set up by Lindsey Hoggle urges the public to share any tips or sightings they have of the children. An anonymous tip line is available at www.findsarahfindjacob.com, which the family updates.  Tips Dwindle Montgomery County Police say they are convinced the children are dead. Capt. Darren Francke with Montgomery County Police told MyMCMedia last month that answers in the case lie with Catherine Hoggle. Our main interest is seeing what is happening with Catherine and her treatment. We believe Catherine is the key to what happened to the children, Francke said. While police have shifted the Hoggle case to a homicide investigation, according to a previous Patch story, Turner and the Hoggle family believe the children are being harbored by someone at Catherine Hoggles request. Turner says if Catherine Hoggle had killed the youngsters, the massive searches in the area would have uncovered their bodies. Donations to the Hoggle fund can be made at the Find Sarah Find Jacob website or by visiting the GoFundMe page set up by Lindsey Hoggle. Timeline of Events On Sept. 7, Catherine Hoggle borrowed her fathers gray 2012 Nissan Rogue SUV and said she was picking up pizza for Jacob. She returned three hours later without the boy or pizza and told her parents she had left Jacob at a playmates house. On Sept. 8, Hoggle left home with Sarah and told Turner she was taking the child to a day-care center. That afternoon when Turner asked about the childrens whereabouts, Hoggle would not tell him where the children were. Both Hoggle and Turner set off for the police station, but stopped at a Chick-Fil-A near the Germantown Transit Center where Hoggle left the restaurant without Turner noticing and disappeared. On Sept. 12, Hoggle was found and arrested in Germantown. On Nov. 6, it was revealed in court that Hoggle allegedly told her mother she could take the police to where the children are. Hoggles lawyer said she did not want to go, and Judge Eugene Wolfe refused to sign an emergency order for her to leave Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center. On Nov. 17, a psychiatric evaluation of Catherine Hoggle was submitted by Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center, finding her not competent to stand trial. Related Stories",0

1852,"Two men in a black pickup tried to coax an 11-year-old boy into their truck at about 4 p.m. Friday in the Adams Township part of Treesdale, according to the boys mother. The mother, whose name Patch is not releasing to protect the identity of the boy, sent out an email to friends and neighbors that went viral over the weekend. Adams Township Police Chief Bill Westerman said his officers responded to the call on Old Orchard Drive within three to four minutes and neighboring police departments --including Cranberry Township officers -- also were notified immediately to be on the lookout for the truck. The area is just north of the Pine Township border. No one reported seeing the truck, Westerman said. His department continues to investigate the incident. Westerman encouraged anyone who sees anything suspicious to call 911 or their local police department. After the chief contacted Mars School District, the school on Monday distributed information to parents about the incident. The boy described the truck as being newer, not beat up like a work truck, his mother said. He also said the truck had silver or gray bars from the cab to the bed of the truck, she said. After looking through truck photos online with his father, the boy said the silver-bar portion of the truck looked similar to pictures of a Chevrolet Avalanche, she said. In an interview Sunday afternoon, the mother said her son left the house at 4 p.m. to walk the familys small dog when a black truck pulled up beside the boy by crossing the center line on Old Orchard Road onto the wrong side of the road. The driver said, Hey, man, hows it going? We want you to come take a ride with us, according to the mothers recounting of the incident. When her son turned and walked in the opposite direction, the man put the truck into reverse and got aggressive yelling for the boy to get into the truck, his mother said. The boy then ran to a friends house nearby and they floored it out of the neighborhood, she said. The mother said the incident happened in an open area, about 30 to 40 yards past houses, just beyond the Watch For Children sign. The boy told police the heavy-set driver was bald with a big, sagging face and no glasses. He described the driver as older than his father, but not as old as his grandfather, and said the man wore a tan jacket made of something similar to leather. He said he never saw the face of the passenger, but saw his hands as he passed something black to the driver, the boys mother said. He felt like they were going to put something over his head, she said. Once he got into the friends home, the boy called home and his mother rushed to the friends house. He was terrified, she said. From the time the boy left the house to the time of the 911 call, only 8 to 10 minutes has passed she said. Police arrived within minutes, and she received calls from two other departments asking for more information so they knew what they were looking for, she said. As a mom, you want to think its not out there, she said, as she expressed her surprise that someone would try to lure a 5-foot-2, 120-pound boy who is big enough to fight back. I also find it bizarre that it was two men, she continued, adding it was hard to fathom that two people would be on the same page with something as terrible as abducting a child. Its bursting that bubble of a false sense of security, the mother said. It can happen anywhere. She encourages parents to talk to their children about stranger danger. I think its a great opportunity to review safety with your kids, she said. Ive had quite a few moms say, Weve been meaning to talk to the kids, but I didnt want to scare them.  From the time her son could hold a conversation, she and her husband have talked to him about stranger danger, the mother said. When children are very young, she said, parents can turn the lesson into a what if game to ask children what they would do if an adult in a car approached them for directions or to ask if they wanted to see a puppy in the car. God protects us and protected us this time, said the mother, who describes the family as a family of faith. The ones who need prayer are those two men. Their hearts are not in the right place, she said. Their hearts are very broken. To contact Adams Township Police Department, please call 724-625-2040.

After entering, they accosted the residents, including children, by pointing guns at them and threatening them, Gwinnett Police said in a news release. During agents entry, the male jumped out of the house from a window and fled. The agents searched the house. They then handcuffed and took a female, the wife of the man, into their custody and drove her away from the scene in a black pick-up. WSB-TV reported there were seven children in the home when the men entered. One of the children shot video of the event on a cell phone. The video was distributed to news outlets Sunday. In the video, one of the agentsis heard telling the children to go into a room and close the door before you get shot. (See the WSB report and the video below) The men told police they were charging the woman with harboring a fugitive and obstructing their efforts to catch the husband. When officers went to speak with the family, the bounty hunters left with the woman. Police located the truck a short time later parked outside the subdivision and released the woman. Their investigation led to the arrests of the men. Other charges are possible, pending further investigation of the cell phone video. The husband has not been located, police said in the news release.  (Photos: Khalil Abdullah and Kevin Roberson. Credit: Gwinnett County jail mug shots)",1
1854,"- A Los Angeles man convicted of kidnapping and robbing a 79-year-old woman inside her South Pasadena home and burglarizing the home of another senior in Pasadena less than two months earlier was sentenced today to 95 years to life in state prison. Alonzo Bernard Johnson, 53, was convicted May 4 of one felony count each of kidnapping to commit robbery, first-degree residential robbery and first- degree burglary with a person present. Jurors also found true allegations that Johnson used a knife and inflicted great bodily injury on an elderly victim. She suffered a brain bleed and ruptured ear drum in the Aug. 6, 2012, attack. Johnson accosted the woman, who was 79 at the time, in her kitchen, broke her nose, demanded money from her, pulled her to a bedroom while armed with a knife and tried to tie her up with an electrical cord after forcing her to lay face-down on her bed, according to Deputy District Attorney Prescilliano Duran. The prosecutor said Johnson repeatedly demanded that the woman give him jewelry and continuously punched her in the head and face. He grabbed the womans jewelry and fled from the home after her two grandchildren -- who were 8 and 12 -- entered the residence and she told them to get help, Duran said. Johnson was arrested the same day by South Pasadena police. Authorities subsequently linked him through DNA and fingerprints to a June 22, 2012, home burglary in Pasadena, in which another 79-year-old woman walked into her bedroom and found him stealing jewelry before he fled from the home, according to Duran.

1855,"By Bay City News Service: A well-known rap artist from San Diego who was arrested Tuesday afternoon on kidnapping and other charges was released from the Marin County jail Thursday night. Charles LaSean Mitchell, 40, known as Mitchy Slick, was released after the Marin County District Attorneys Office decided not to file charges against him. Chief Deputy District Attorney Barry Borden said Saturday afternoon the case is still actively under investigation and charges are not being filed at this time. Mitchell was suspected of kidnapping a female from Southern California, taking her to Marin County and holding her captive in a residence on Oak Knoll Drive in the Sleepy Hollow area of San Anselmo, Marin County sheriffs Lt. Doug Pittman said. The sheriffs office conducted an early morning SWAT operation and high-risk search warrant on Aug. 22 at a residence at 30 Oak Knoll Drive in San Anselmo. Mitchell was not at the residence and he turned himself in at the Marin County jail after a Marin County Superior Court Judge issued a $1.5 million arrest warrant on Tuesday. Mitchell was booked on felony charges of human trafficking, participating in a street gang and kidnapping and a misdemeanor charge of brandishing a firearm. His bail was set at $1.5 million. The Marin County Sheriffs Office said Mitchell is suspected of being an active member of the Lincoln Park Bloods criminal street gang in San Diego. The gang has a history of weapons violations, pimping, assaults and homicides against law enforcement officers, Pittman said. Pittman said Wednesday the sheriffs office is investigating how Mitchell is associated with the Sleepy Hollow residence or its owners. Pittman was not available for comment Friday on Mitchells connection to the residence and the nature of his relationship with the Southern California woman he allegedly kidnapped. Chief Deputy District Attorney Barry Borden said today he could not comment on the investigation or provide details why charges were not filed.

Michael Johnson of the in Rochester Hills. Last night, in a couple different locations up in Oakland Township, there were kids that were outside playing at 5:30 in the evening that were approached by a couple of teenagers in a car, and they were just told to get in the car, Johnson said. Johnson said a car full of teenagers approached at least two different groups of kids as they were playing outside. Were talking about 17- or 18- or 19-year-old kids that are talking to 10- or 11-year old kids, Johnson said. The 10- or 11-year-old kids that were riding on their bicycles just rode off and didnt pay any attention to them. Johnson said the kids then told their parents, who immediately called the police.

Five 8-year-olds were playing in the front yard, and (he) yelled, Hey, get in the car, and again, they all scampered and headed into the garage. Johnson said the sheriffs office is working toward finding the individuals responsible, and R is planning to send an email to parents today informing them of the incidents.

1866,"Reported by Toni McAllister: A former San Bernardino police officer has been arrested on suspicion of forcing prostitutes to perform sex acts while he was in uniform and/or carrying a gun. Perez became a police officer in 1997, when he was hired by the Los Angeles Police Department. Perez worked for the LAPD until 2008, when he went to work for the San Bernardino Police Department. Perez was released from employment by SBPD in December, according to the news release.  Wednesdays indictment, which was unsealed following Perezs arrest, alleges that he forcibly had sex with two women who told investigators that they engaged in the sex acts demanded by Perez only because they feared for their well-being because he was a police officer, the news release stated.  The indictment alleges that on April 25, 2011, Perez groped a woman and caused her to perform oral sex by using force against her. According to the indictment, the attack resulted in bodily injury to the victim, constituted aggravated sexual abuse, involved the use of a dangerous weapon (Perezs service weapon), and resulted in the kidnapping of the victim, the news release stated.  The remaining three counts in the indictment charge Perez with unlawfully having sexual intercourse with a woman on three occasions in August and September 2011. According to a criminal complaint filed last month and also unsealed Thursday, this victim feared that if she refused Perezs sexual advances he could and would make her life difficult. She told investigators that she believed she would experience problems if she did not cooperate with Perezs requests, according to the complaint.  Mr. Perez allegedly violated the civil rights of victims he vowed to protect, instead of gaining their trust and providing them with the basic respect all members of a community deserve, said Bill L. Lewis, assistant director in charge of the FBIs Los Angeles field office. By his alleged actions, Mr. Perez also violated the trust of his fellow officers and the community he swore to serve as a police officer in the city of San Bernardino. The FBI values its relationship with partnering local police and appreciates the support provided by the San Bernardino Police Department in this case.  Perez is expected to make his initial court appearance Friday in U.S. District Court in Sherman, Texas. Each of the four counts in the indictment carry a statutory maximum penalty of life in federal prison.  The investigation into Perez was conducted by the San Bernardino Police Department and the FBI, the news release stated.  It is not clear why Perez was in Denton or whether he had fled there from Southern California to escape  local investigators.",1

The officer in turn fired multiple rounds at Gamez-Fierro in defense of his life, Cregan said. Police say Gamez-Fierro was struck by two of those gunshots. His injuries were described as not-life-threatening and he will be booked into jail once he is medically cleared, Cregan said. The was a delay in confirming the suspects identities because both were allegedly carrying fake IDs bearing false names, Cregan said. Over the weekend, authorities confirmed Gomez-Rosales as the second robbery suspect found hiding inside of GardaWorld after the officer-involved shooting occurred, Cregan said. At the time he was found, he allegedly had a handgun and a latex gloves next to him that police believe were used in the commission of the robbery. Gomez-Rosales is being held on suspicion of robbery, assault on a peace officer, false imprisonment and kidnapping. Gamez-Fierro will be booked into jail as soon as he is medically cleared, Cregan said. It is alleged that Gamez-Fierro wore a ski-mask and latex gloves and was holding a firearm in his hand at the time of the officer-involved shooting. A handgun and a Taser were found near Gamez-Fierro following the shooting, police allege. Sunday morning, Santa Rosa police detectives served a search warrant at Gamez-Fierros residence in the 1300 block of Zachary Place and allegedly located additional evidence inside of Gamez-Fierros bedroom linking him to the robbery, Cregan said. Authorities have also since determined that Gamez-Fierro is on federal felony probation for interference with commerce/robbery and is prohibited from possessing a firearm. Gomez-Rosales is also a convicted felon prohibited from possessing a firearm, according to police. Anyone who witnessed the robbery or the officer-involved shooting is encouraged to call the Santa Rosa Police Violent Crimes Team at 707-543-3590.

1881,"Three Union County based moving companies were issued Notices of Violation for operating without licenses, Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal announced Monday. J & L Moving of Hillside, Moving Hero of Rahway and Roadway Moving of Elizabeth were among 29 to be busted as part of a state-led undercover sting called Operation Mothers Attic in April. Each unlicensed mover was also assessed a $2,500 civil penalty. Undercover investigators from the Divisions Office of Consumer Protection pretended to be planning to move from an upscale neighborhood in Montville and hired various unlicensed moving companies advertising online for their move, according to the report. The movers drove to Montville where they were met by the OCP investigators and issued NOVs for operating without licenses. An unlicensed moving company can be a homeowners worst nightmare, said Grewal. Theyve been known to hold truckloads of property hostage until the customer pays an extortionate fee. And these unlicensed movers often dont carry adequate insurance, creating the risk that homeowners will be left high and dry if their property is seriously damaged during the move. Thats why we regulate the industry – and why we crack down on rogue operators. The public movers cited for operating without a license are: State Polices Mobile Safety Freight Unit was also at the Montville location to conduct vehicle safety inspections on their trucks. Members of the U.S. Department of Transportations Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration also checked for verification that out-of-state movers were registered with the FMCSA to engage in interstate operations. The inspections found 29 motor vehicle violations, five of them serious enough to put the vehicles out of service. Three drivers were prohibited from driving trucks away from the scene because of motor vehicle violations, including not having a valid drivers license or not having a proper license. Two people were placed under arrest for outstanding warrants, and one person was arrested for possession of under 50 grams of marijuana.

1887,"Officials in Naperville are warning residents to be on the lookout for different telephone scams that fraudsters use to try to get money from their victims. Naperville Police Department consistently gets reports of phone scams and fraudulent calls, officials said in a post on the citys website. From utility disconnection scams to so-called grandparent scams, heres what to watch out for and how to protect yourself from becoming a victim. Grandparent Scam Scammers target elderly residents and pretend to be a grandchild in this prevalent phone scam. Often the scammers are known as spoofers because they can even make it appear as if theyre calling from a child or grandchilds phone number. This method plays on the emotions of concerned grandparents and parents, with spoofers pretending to be a child who is in trouble and needs financial help. If you get a call like this, hang up and attempt to call your grandchild or child from the contacts list in your phone. Alternatively, grandparents can call a parent or guardian to verify the validity of the call, police suggest. Utility Bill/IRS/Collection Agency Scam If you get a call from a utility company, a collection agency, or the IRS demanding money, take that as a red flag. Police say scammers may call from a number that shows up as the IRS or an electrical, cable, gas, or other utility company. In these cases, the fraudster usually says the victim owes back payments and may even threaten jail time if money is not sent. Police warn residents to take caution in instances like this. For one, the IRS says it will not call you demanding money. If you get a call from a purported utility company asking you to send money, hang up and call the company at its official phone number instead of calling back the number the call came from. Kidnapping Scam This terrifying scam taps into a parents worst fear by faking a kidnapping and demanding ransom money, police say. Often, the caller will say they have the victims child and wont return the child until the money is wired to them. In this scenario, Naperville Police recommend using extreme caution, as the caller might use personal information to try to fool you. They suggest asking several detailed questions to try to thwart the scammer . Another similar scam known as the arresting scam involves the caller pretending to be a loved one who has been arrested and needs cash to get out.  Some common takeaways from these scams include never giving out personal information over the phone unless youve called the utility company, bank, or other organization yourself. If youre speaking from someone who says they are from a company and is asking for personal information, hang up and attempt to call them back at an official phone number you can usually find online.

1899,"A Dairy Queen franchisee was briefly held hostage and used as a human shield during an attempted robbery in Lincoln City Sunday night, according to court documents obtained by Patch. The alleged robber, 26-year-old Chase Allen Martin, was arrested and taken to the Lincoln County Jail on charges of kidnapping, robbery, attempted theft, and burglary. His bail is set at $295,000. Lincoln City officers were dispatched to conduct a welfare check at the Dairy Queen Restaurant at 2224 N.E. Highway 101 just after 11 p.m. Feb. 18. The first officer on scene, Sgt. Randy Weaver, reportedly checked the building and spotted Martin. After Martin saw Weaver, he reportedly fled further into the building and toward the back of the restaurant. When Officer KC Claunts arrived, Weaver told him to check around the back. At the drive-thru window, Claunts found Martin wearing a black hoodie (with the hood up), black pants, a black bandana covering his face, and sunglasses, Claunts wrote in a probable cause affidavit. Watching Martin try to open the drive-thru window, Claunts pulled his service pistol and ordered Martin to get on the ground. Instead, Martin chose to run toward the back of the Dairy Queen. Peering through the backdoor window, Claunts reportedly saw Martin now holding the restaurant owner, Ill Woo Park, who was bleeding from his head. Using Park as a human shield, Martin pushed the franchisee back toward the front of the Dairy Queen. After returning to the drive-thru window and finding it unlocked, Claunts said he entered the restaurant and approached Martin from behind while two additional officers joined Weaver. Surrounded, Martin was reportedly taken into custody without further incident. On his person, Martin was reportedly carrying Parks wallet and car keys, as well as other items in various peoples names, Claunts said. Prior to police arrival, it appeared as though Martin cut the wires to the business video surveillance and attempted to breach a safe holding $1,400 in cash, Claunts said, noting money from the registers and chairs were found strewn about the office area. Martin has faced a plethora of charges for crimes committed in 16 separate incidents since 2010, including the one Feb. 18, court documents show. Of the 16 incidents, 10 include charges for theft.

1904,"The FBI today accused North Korea of being behind the cyberattack that prompted Sony Pictures to cancel the release of The Interview, a development raising fears among entertainers that the free speech rights of Americans are threatened. As a result of our investigation, and in close cooperation with other U.S. government departments and agencies, the FBI now has enough information to conclude that the North Korean government is responsible for these actions, according to an FBI statement. Before the statement was issued, actor George Clooney said he and his agent circulated a petition in support of Sony after it became the victim of a the cyberattack and before it cancelled the Christmas Day release of The Interview, but none of the many entertainment figures who were asked to sign it agreed to do so. The thrust of the petition circulated by Clooney and his agent, Bryan Lourd, was were not going to give in to a ransom, Clooney said. He further accused the press of abdicating its responsibility to focusing on salacious Sony email links rather than investigating the hackers. A good portion of the press abdicated its real duty. They played the fiddle while Rome burned, he told Deadline Hollywood. There was a real story going on. With just a little bit of work, you could have found out that it wasnt just probably North Korea; it was North Korea, he said. The FBI, in effectively confirming Clooneys assertion, said it found telltale signs in the cyberattack. The FBI has determined that the intrusion into (Sony Pictures Entertainments) network consisted of the deployment of destructive malware and the theft of proprietary information, as well as employees personally identifiable information and confidential communications ... the FBI statement said. Technical analysis of the data deletion malware used in this attack revealed links to other malware that the FBI knows North Korean actors previously developed.",0

Ricardo Colindres, 26, is a transient with family ties to Brisbane on the Peninsula, Lodi in San Joaquin County and Burson in Calaveras County. He also frequents Las Vegas, Deputy U.S. Marshal Joseph Palmer said. Listed among Northern Californias Most Wanted, he is sought by the Pacifica Police Department, along with the U.S. Marshals, for suspicion of attempted murder and attempted kidnapping.  On April 27, at the Casa Pacifica Apartments in Pacifica, Colindres allegedly tried to abduct his ex-girlfriend, who was eight months pregnant, before he shot her in the head.

We are continuing to investigate this case to the fullest extent possible, said U.S. Marshal Don OKeefe.

1910,"A Ruskin man is facing additional sexual battery and kidnapping charges after Hillsborough County Sheriffs deputies found an incriminating video on his cell phone showing a second victim. Deputies arrested Jerry Roberts, 32, of 729 21st Ave., S.E., Ruskin, in April after a woman reported that, on April 11, Roberts struck her multiple times in the face and head, held a machete to her neck, tied her up, sexually battered her and held her inside a vacant home for about 18 hours.

1911,"The man charged with the rape and beating of a young mother in Highland Park in February of this year — which terrified the town and shocked Central New Jersey — pleaded guilty on Monday to the crime. He was sentenced to 23 years in jail. The Middlesex County Prosecutor announced that Brandon Cox, 23, of the Somerset section of Franklin Township, admitted to the crime Monday. The woman was out walking with her baby in a stroller on Harper Avenue when she was attacked on Feb. 19 of this year. Cox sexually assaulted and severely beat her, police said. Police determined that the mother, 36, was approached by Cox on the sidewalk; he displayed a handgun and forced her into the basement of the Harper House apartment building. He sexually assaulted her there and repeatedly punched her. The beating was severe, police said. He then fled. A resident of Harper Avenue called police after the victim ran to the neighbors home following the attack. She had blood pouring down her face, witnesses told the media. The baby was unharmed. The attack happened in daylight, just after 5 p.m. on an unseasonably warm Sunday before the Presidents Day holiday. Cox pleaded guilty to kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault Monday. Under a plea agreement reached with Middlesex County Assistant Prosecutor Allysa Gambarella, he will be sentenced to 23 years in a New Jersey state prison. He will be required to serve 85 percent of the term before he can be released on parole. As Patch reported, Cox has been charged with sex assault before: In 2014, a 14-year-old girl said he sexually assaulted her over an extended period of time and occurred while Cox was living in South Brunswick. Cox was 20 at the time. The victim, accompanied by her mother, told Franklin police that between March 2013 and April 2014, Cox threatened her into sexual situations on four separate occasions. All the alleged sex assaults happened at her Franklin Township home.  As part of a deal he made with the Somerset County prosecutors office, Cox pleaded guilty to charges of child abuse and neglect in that case. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail; however, he had already served much of that time while being held on a $50,000 cash-only bail awaiting trial. He was released from the Somerset County jail on Aug. 2, 2016, just a few days after his sentencing. He served close to 15 months of his 18-month sentence. The crime stunned quiet, well-off Highland Park, which has a lively main street and is very pedestrian-friendly. People often walk to the boroughs coffee shops, stroll to restaurants or across the Raritan River bridge to the Rutgers New Brunswick campus and the NJ Transit station. Many mothers can be seen walking with children. At the time, residents told Patch they were almost in disbelief the crime occurred and that they were very scared to walk around town. This was too close for comfort, said Rabbi Steven Miodownik, who oversees Congregation Ahavas Achim on Johnson Street, located just a few blocks away from the attack. Ive been here for 15 years and you never hear of anything like this happening here. Cox also must register as a Megans Law sex offender and will undergo parole supervision for life. The sentence is expected to be imposed by Superior Court Judge Alberto Rivas at a hearing on October 16. Cox was charged during an intensive investigation by Detective Sean McGraw of the Highland Park Police Department and Detective Allie Bitterman of the Middlesex County Prosecutors Office.

1912,"A Richmond man already in Santa Rita Jail for sexual assault, kidnapping, robbery and burglary charges from 2008 and 2015 is facing new charges in a 2005 El Cerrito case. The Alameda County District Attorneys Office has filed two counts each of rape and kidnapping in connection with that case, according to court documents. Keith Asberry is accused in the violent 2005 home invasion in El Cerrito. Investigators said they were able to solve the crime in part due to advances in forensic science, finally identifying 33-year-old Asberry as a suspect using a new DNA test. According to El Cerrito police, Asberry knocked on the door of a home in the 1400 block of Liberty Street shared by two roommates at about 7:30 p.m. on Feb. 14, 2005, shortly after the women had returned home. When one of the residents opened the door, Asberry, wearing a mask and dark clothing, threatened her with a gun and forced his way inside, police said. He demanded their money and jewelry and walked them to different rooms of the house, taking one of the roommates to a bathroom and forcing her to lie on the floor and then taking the other 20-year-old roommate to her bedroom. He also forced her to lie on the floor before raping her, police said. After that, he took one of their car keys. Asberry tried to force them to come with him, but when they refused, he took the car and fled. At the time, police were looking into the possibility that the suspect had stalked the women earlier in the evening, watching them walk into the apartment.

1915,"Every 40 seconds, the time it takes to heat up a slice of pizza in the microwave, a child is reported missing somewhere in America. Some are runaways, but others are abducted. Most have found their way home, due in part to efforts like those taking place today, May 25, on National Missing Childrens Day to reunite kids and their families. In Massachusetts, at least 54 children have been reported as missing since 1994. Thats according to a database kept by the Polly Klaas Foundation that includes the names of more than 9,800 children reported missing from 1994-2017. The foundation is named for the California 12-year-old who was taken from her home on Oct. 1, 1993, by a knife-wielding intruder who interrupted a childrens slumber party and carried her away. Her body was found nine weeks later, on Dec. 3, 1993. The actual number of kids who are reported missing every year is hard to calculate, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, established in 1984 to provide a coordinated national approach to find missing kids. Because some children are never reported missing and others, like repeat runaways, are entered in the FBI National Crime Information Center each time they run away, theres no way to reliably know exactly how many children are missing. Since its founding nearly 35 years ago, the NCMEC has assisted in the recovery of more than 260,000 children. But some have never been found. Still missing in Massachusetts, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, are these children who vanished this month: David Acevedo, 16, has been missing from Great Barrington since May 22. He is Hispanic with black hair and brown eyes. Jakob Beth, 15, has been missing from Pittsfield since May 7. He is white with brown hair and brown eyes. Kaitlin Campbell, 17, has been missing from Springfield since May 15. She is white with blonde hair and green eyes. Paolla Cardosa Moura, 17, has been missing from Revere since May 15. She is white with brown hair and brown eyes. Lindsey Green, 16, has been missing from Fall River since May 17. She is white with brown hair (recently dyed blonde) and brown eyes. Misty Lottmann, 17, has been missing from Malden since May 2. She is white with brown hair (may be dyed auburn or red) and brown eyes. Nayeli Nieves, 15, has been missing from Lowell since May 15. She is Hispanic with brown hair and brown eyes. Alies Spinola, 15, has been missing from Quincy from May 13. She is black, with black hair (may be dyed red) and brown eyes. The nonprofit National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was established by parents like John and Revé Walsh, whose 6-year-old son, Adam, was abducted from a Florida shopping mall in 1981 and later found murdered. Before the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children existed, police could enter information about stolen cars, guns and other items on the FBIs crime database, but not stolen children. The Adam Walsh disappearance was among several tragic cases that illuminated the need for a nationwide, coordinated system to address the problem of missing children. Others included Etan Patz, a 6-year-old who vanished from a New York street on the way to school in 1979. Over the next several years, 29 children and young adults reported as missing were found murdered in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1982, West Des Moines, Iowa, paperboy Johnny Gosch, 12, never came home from his paper route. His disappearance remains unsolved. Former President Ronald Reagan was an honored guest when the NCMEC opened its doors in 1984. A year earlier, he had proclaimed every May 25 as National Missing Childrens Day. Since then, the Department of Justice has annually commemorated National Missing Childrens Day with a ceremony honoring heroic and exemplary efforts of agencies, organizations and individuals to protect children, and to coordinate efforts to reunite missing children with their families. The problem of missing children is particularly acute in California, which accounts for nearly half of the missing children cases documented on the Polly Klaas Foundation website. The states with the most missing children reports since 1994 are: California: 4,541Texas: 489Florida: 364Arizona: 246New York: 223Washington: 218Ohio: 209Colorado: 183Illinois: 177Georgia: 171Oregon: 153Pennsylvania: 153Nevada: 150Michigan: 130Indiana: 124",1
1916,"Prosecutors in Bucks County will seek the death penalty against the man and woman they say murdered then dismembered a 14-year-old girl last July. The announcement was made Friday in court, when Jacob Sullivan, 44, waived his formal arraignment on charges he killed and raped his girlfriends daughter, Grace Packer. His girlfriend, Sara Packer, is also charged with her adopted daughters murder. Prosecutors have already signaled theyll seek the death penalty against her, according to multiple reports. The pair was charged in January, six months after authorities say they beat, raped and poisoned the girl before strangling her in Richland Township over an 18-hour period. Packer and Sullivan then preserved the girls corpse for weeks in cat litter before dismembering and dumping it in a remote area of north central Pennsylvania, according to the Bucks County District Attorney. Grace had been reported missing last July in Montgomery County. Authorities say the pair in December attempted to carry out a suicide pact by overdosing on prescription drugs. Sullivan is charged with homicide, rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, unlawful restraint, kidnapping, possessing instruments of crime, endangering the welfare of a child, abuse of corpse, simple assault, tampering with physical evidence, and corresponding conspiracy charges. Packer is charged with homicide, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, possessing instruments of crime, endangering the welfare of a child, abuse of corpse, simple assault, tampering with physical evidence, and conspiracy charges. Just three people have been executed in Pennsylvania since the death penalty was re-instituted in 1976, according to NBC10. The trial is scheduled for next year.",1

1918,"Photo courtesy of law enforcement authorities A pre-trial hearing is scheduled next Wednesday for a Los Angeles man who allegedly overpowered and beat a 79-year-old woman in her South Pasadena home, putting her in the hospital. Alonzo Bernard Johnson, 52, is set for a hearing in Dept. T of the Alhambra Courthouse, 150 W. Commonwealth Ave. He is charged with one count each of first-degree burglary with a person present, first-degree residential robbery and kidnapping to commit another crime. The criminal complaint also alleges that Johnson personally inflicted great bodily injury on a victim over 70, personally used a knife and has seven criminal convictions dating back to 1981 for burglary, theft and attemptedrobbery. The victim left her front door open while waiting for her grandchildren to arrive to her home on the 1000 block of Indiana Avenue around 7:45 a.m. in 2012, said South Pasadena Detective Bill Earley. This was a crime of convenience, said Earley. The suspect saw the front door wide open. South Pasadena is safe and small town, but residents still need to lock their doors, he continued. The suspect walked in and asked to charge his cell phone, but when the victim told him to leave, he allegedly pulled out a kitchen knife and threatened to kill her, according to reports. While holding the knife against her, the suspect forced her into a rear bedroom, face down onto the bed and began beating her, police reported. Authorities said the woman was threatened with a paring knife taken from her kitchen, struck in the face by her assailants fists and taken to various parts of the home to try to find money. The attacker ran from the home with a fistful of jewelry when the womans grandchildren arrived, according to authorities. Johnson was arrested a short time later. If convicted, Johnson faces life in state prison with the possibility of parole, according to the District Attorneys Office. South Pasadena is safe and small town, but residents still need to lock their doors, he continued. Johnson was carrying an MTA pass, and allegedly took the Gold Line from Los Angeles to South Pasadena, said Earley. His last registered address was to a group home on Skid Row. Since the Gold Line has opened up, a lot more crime has happened in that area, he said. The police department pays a lot more attention to that area. Earley says Johnson has been in and out of jail since the 80s. He has used several aliases and has served time in state prison, according to reports. Previous felony arrests include robbery and burglary. Most recently, he was released from jail in July after serving time for a parole violation, said Earley. The victim was treated at a hospital for a broken nose, unspecified internal injuries, and numerous cuts and bruises; her grandchildren underwent counseling after the trauma of witnessing their grandmother being beaten, according to L.A. Now. The grandmother recovered from her injuries. --City News Service contributed to this story",1
1919,"Sentencing was delayed on Thursday until Oct. 13 for a Mexican Mafia member who also headed a San Gabriel Valley gang that targeted black victims. James Chemo Gutierrez, 53, pleaded guilty in April to three conspiracy counts involving racketeering, narcotics distribution and money laundering. Gutierrez, leader of the El Monte Flores gang, faces between 10 years to life in federal prison when he is sentenced by U.S. District Judge John A. Kronstadt. He was the lead defendant in a 41-person federal indictment detailing allegations of murder, kidnapping, drug trafficking, robbery, burglary, carjacking, witness intimidation and other offenses. The gang often committed hate crimes directed against African- Americans who might reside or be present in the cities of El Monte and South El Monte in an effort to rid these cities of all African-Americans, according to the 62-count indictment. Other gang-related crimes outlined in the 2014 document include the execution of a former Mexican Mafia member and the fatal shooting of four others in an El Monte home in 1995. The indictment also describes an ongoing dispute involving members of the Mexican Mafia who are attempting to exercise control over the gang. Gutierrez is currently in federal custody after his supervised release was revoked following a 20-year sentence in a federal homicide case. Other Mexican Mafia members serving life prison terms are not charged in the indictment, but they are listed as co-conspirators. The gang maintained a significant presence at the Boys & Girls Club in San Gabriel, where gang members openly sold drugs, held gang meetings and even held a car wash fundraiser, according to the indictment.Members of the gang also regularly used and threatened to use violence to extort taxes from local drug dealers and fraudulent document vendors, the indictment says. Prosecutors further outlined several incidents dating back to early 2001 in which black victims in El Monte were attacked, threatened and subjected to racial epithets. --City News Service/Shutterstock image",0

1922,"Homeless and hopeless, David Allen Potchen is the bank robber who didnt want the money, he just wanted to be caught. His career as a stickup man began in 2001, when he walked into a Lowell, Ind., bank armed with a shotgun and took nine employees hostage. But he didnt ask for money in the four hours he spent chatting with the terrified tellers and bank manager as FBI and SWAT surrounded the bank. He asked for two Big Macs and cigarettes. Potchen traded hostages for hamburgers, telling police he hadnt eaten in a week. He asked for chips and juice and let a few more hostages go. A working man who brought home $2,350 a month, he was once a welder at Thrall Car Manufacturing in Chicago Heights, a builder of railroad freight cars, the industrial muscle that moves almost everything we buy from one end of our country to the other. Potchen walked into that bank, shotgun in hand, because hed gone bankrupt and lost everything — his home, his job, his truck and every nickel he had. When the 39 year old was brought before a judge, he faced 230 years in prison on nine felony counts of criminal confinement. He wasnt charged with bank robbery because he didnt ask for any money. My life wasnt going right, he told the judge. His aunt and cousins pleaded with the judge: He needs counseling, not prison. His lawyer sought leniency. One cousin, Karen Potchen of Downers Grove, wrote to the papers in an attempt to explain how Potchen was a good man, unafraid of hard work, unable to ask for help. He spent an entire day at my house one day helping my dad dig holes to plant trees. He probably dug 100 holes, in hard clay, and never once complained. David has had some rough blows in his life. Not that it should be — nor is it — an excuse for what happened. David was never the type to ask for help. That day, he was crying out for help and he didnt even know it. Nevertheless, Potchen was sentenced to 25 years in prison. He says he kept to himself, stayed out of trouble, even worked as a welder. In March 2014, he was paroled. He found a room at a Gary motel and another job as a welder, this time at Stanrail for $11 an hour. Hed walk to work, but the work didnt last long. Within three months, the 53-year-old parolee didnt have enough money to keep a roof over his head. One day in June, Potchen spent the night in the woods, sleeping in the grass, a hoodie wrapped over his head to keep out the mosquitoes. He awoke with a plan. The next morning, he walked several miles to a Chase bank branch in Merrillville, passed the teller a note asking for five-dollar and 10-dollar bills, pocketed $1,650 and then walked outside to sit on the curb. Im the one you are looking for, Potchen told a cop as he approached the bank. I robbed the bank. Last month, Potchen asked a judge to throw the book at him and send him to prison for eight more years, plus another five for violating his parole. Once I ran out of money, I couldnt bear the thought of losing everything again, he told the judge. I begged the guy dont lay me off. ... I said I would forfeit my insurance and not take a raise. He tried to find another job, but no one would hire him. I dont even want unemployment because thats how I was brought up. You gotta get out there and work. And if you cant find it, thats when stuff falls apart. You gotta figure, What are you going to do now? And the first thing that popped into my head was, Well, Ill just go to prison.  Judge Clarence Murray admonished Potchen — you cant stay in prison forever — and asked whether hed accept a lesser sentence if a job and a place to stay could be found for him. I hope to God someone reads about this and offers some help to you, said Murray, the same judge who sentenced Potchen to prison after his first desperate foray into crime. Youre not a throwaway, Mr. Potchen. You have value, sir. Potchens attorney, Stephen Scheele, told reporters hes been talking to businesses in Northwest Indiana since word of his clients arrest hit the newspapers. Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass visited Potchen in jail to tell his story. Scheele may have three potential construction jobs lined up for Potchen. He will return to court on March 18, where he may learn what comes next for him. Will it be work or jail? Potchen is a simple man, a man who doesnt know how to ask for help. Hes a working man without work. And to be without work, for some men, is to be nothing at all. » read it on The Patch with a free email subscription",1
1923,"- Almost exactly three years ago, the brutal murder of a wealthy couple and their 10-year-old son as well as their housekeeper shocked the District. And with the lone suspect about to go to trial in a few months, there are unanswered questions, according to a report. It was on May 14, 2015 when a fire erupted at the home of Savvas and Amy Savopoulos near National Cathedral, leading to the discovery of their bodies and that of their 10-year-old son, Philip. Their 57-year-old housekeeper, Vera Figeroa, later died at the hospital. Police believe the four of them were held hostage beginning on May 13, and eventually they were killed via blunt and sharp force trauma, with Philip also experiencing thermal injuries, meaning he was still alive as the house burned. Police arrested Darron Wint a few days later, claiming he committed the murders and made off with $40,000 in ransom money. He had worked for Savopolous company in Hyattsville, Md. at one time. But as a new WTOP report notes, there are some puzzling aspects about the case. Investigators have a hard time believing that just one person could pull off the elaborate crime. But so far, Wint has been the only person identified as the culprit. His DNA was found on a pizza crust at the home, prosecutors say. Wint, who was discharged from the Marine Corps due to medical reasons, reportedly had a long rap sheet that included being convicted in 2009 of second-degree assault, pleading guilty to malicious destruction of property in 2010, and facing a number of other theft, assault, and weapons charges over the years. Prominent D.C. attorney Robin Ficker has said that Wints family does not believe that Wint was responsible for the killings, saying that authorities had arrested the wrong person and the Wint did not even like pizza. Wints trial is finally set to begin Sept. 5 after numerous delays. JUNE 01: The caskets of Savvas Savopoulos, 46, his wife, Amy, 47, are carried down steps after their funeral service at the Saint Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral June 1, 2015 in Washington, DC.

1924,"A burglary suspect suffered a non-lethal bullet wound Monday when he pulled a gun on a deputy following a traffic stop on the vehicle he carjacked from a man and his young son near Beacons Beach, prompting the lawman to open fire on him, sheriffs officials said. The shooting in the area of Leucadia Boulevard and North Coast Highway 101 in Encinitas occurred about 3 p.m. Medics took 35-year-old Joseph Ramos, a suspect in a residential burglary, to a hospital for treatment of a wound that was not considered life- threatening. The carjacking victims, who had been riding in the vehicle with the suspect, were uninjured, as were all involved law enforcement personnel, authorities said. The pursuit of Ramos began shortly after 2:30 p.m. when deputies spotted Ramos on Orchard Wood Road, said Lt. Kenneth Nelson of the San Diego County Sheriffs Department. RELATED: They recognized Ramos as a documented gang member, who was also wanted in connection with a string of residential burglaries where several guns had been stolen, Nelson said. Deputies attempted to contact Ramos but before they could do so, he got into a black truck and sped off, Nelson said. Deputies followed and a short pursuit ensued but they quickly backed off when the saw that speeds and road conditions were too dangerous to continue, so they decided to follow Ramos at a distance, according to Nelson. Ramos drove to the intersection of Rancho Santa Fe Road and Manchester Avenue where he abandoned his black truck and ran into a nearby parking lot, Nelson said. In the parking lot, Ramos confronted a 27-year-old man who was buckling his 7-year-old son into his car seat. According to the victim, Ramos pointed to a handgun in his waistband and demanded that the victim drive him away from the area. The man complied and with his 7-year-old son in the back seat, he drove Ramos from the area in his silver two-door Scion, Nelson said. During the drive, the victim said Ramos took the gun from his waistband and pointed it at him several times. Deputies were able to eventually catch up to the Scion a short time later and pulled the car over in the 1500 block of North Coast Highway 101. When the Scion came to a stop, according to the victim of the carjacking and kidnapping, Ramos pointed the gun at both he and his son then exited the car with the gun still drawn, Nelson said. One of the responding deputies saw the gun pointed at him and fired multiple shots. Ramos ran a short distance and fell to the ground, where he was taken into custody, Nelson said. Detectives from the sheriffs Homicide Detail and the North Coastal Sheriffs Station responded to the scene and were investigating. Ramos is being held on an outstanding felony warrant, Nelson said. Detectives will determine what additional charges are appropriate for Ramos once he is released from the hospital, Nelson said. The shooting prompted police to close traffic lanes in the immediate area, and rail service was suspended between Poinsettia Lane and Encinitas Boulevard into the late afternoon. - City News Service / Image via Shutterstock",0
1925,"- A Holiday woman has been arrested for filing a false police report with the Pasco County Sheriffs Office. On Saturday, July 14, Tammy Steffens, 36, reported that a man attempted to kidnap her 12-year-old daughter on Mela Court in Holiday (see related story). Pasco Sheriffs Office detectives spent a lot of man hours and multiple resources investigating the case. They have since discovered that the attempted abduction never took place. Steffen reportedly coached her 12-year-old daughter and had her daughter urinate in her pants to make it more believable. Pasco detectives said Steffen even planted evidence with including a notebook with personal information about the girl.

1929,"- Deputies struggling with a 35-year-old homeless man were helped by customers at a Paramount restaurant where the suspect had grabbed a 7-year-old girl, the sheriffs department reported Wednesday. A deputy responded about 3:40 p.m. Tuesday to a report of a man arguing with customers at the restaurant at the intersection of Alondra and Paramount boulevards, according to Deputy Juanita Navarro-Suarez of the Sheriffs Information Bureau. When the first deputy arrived on scene, she saw two males fighting inside the restaurant, according to Navarro-Suarez, who said a second deputy arrived at the scene in less than a minute. They quickly approached two civilians who were detaining a male black adult, fitting the description of the suspect in the call, she said. The suspect broke free and struggled with the deputies as they tried to prevent him from fleeing. Seeing that the suspect was overpowering the deputies and refused to cooperate by complying with orders to stop fighting, the two civilians came to the deputies aid, Navarro-Suarez said. The combatant suspect continued to fight, refused to comply with directions and in an effort to quickly and safely quell the disturbance, less than lethal force was used. The success of the use of the Taser allowed the deputies to take the suspect into custody without any of the innocent patrons being injured. Additional deputies soon arrived and assisted in taking the man -- later identified as Lorenzo Ray Traylor of Paramount -- into custody. Witnesses, including a woman dining with her daughter and granddaughters, alleged that Traylor, who was unprovoked, was talking loudly as he approached the family and grabbed food from their table. Fearing for their safety, the grandmother grabbed her grandchildren and moved them towards the business counter, Navarro-Suarez said. The suspect walked towards them, snatched the 7-year-old grandchild by the arm and pulled her away from the grandmother. A restaurant employee and a customer intervened and separated Traylor from the family, who retreated to back of the business. The distraught and fearful grandmother and mother of the children pushed the 7-year-old out of the restaurants drive-through window to get her away from the suspect, Navarro-Suarez said. The suspect is currently at a local hospital awaiting clearance for booking, she said. He faces charges of kidnapping, battery on a peace officer and burglary. -- City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",0

1931,"- The Salem News is reporting that the lawyer for a man accused of killing two people in a Peabody home last year asked a judge to throw out nearly all the evidence in the case, including the bodies of the victims, Mark Greenlaw and Jennifer OConnor. John Apruzzese, the attorney for Wes Doughty, filed a motion in March that argues police obtained the evidence in a second search of the home after an initial, emergency search but before they had applied for a search warrant. The motion stems from the fact that the only evidence discovered on the initial search of the house was a shotgun and ammunition. It was only during the second search that an police officer noticed the foot of Greenlaws body. A hearing on the motion is scheduled for June 15. Doughty, 40, is charged with two counts of murder, rape, attempted arson of a dwelling, armed carjacking and kidnapping. On Feb. 17, 2017 police found the bodies of Greenlaw, 37, and his girlfriend OConnor, 40, wrapped and rolled into rugs in the basement of the building. Greenlaw, 39, was killed with a shotgun blast to the face, and OConnor, 37, was raped and had her throat slit, prosecutors said. It was the most horrific crime scene some veteran officers had ever seen. One of the suspects, Michael Hebb, pleaded guilty in October to helping cover up OConnors murder and trying to burn down the house. He was sentenced up to seven years in prison. Prosecutors said he could still be charged in the death of Greenlaw. Investigators have been back to the house to conduct other investigations, including once last month.

Officers arrested Montony Retic Thursday for the January incident and charged him with a slew of crimes, ranging from aggravated assault and kidnapping to interference with a 911 call. (For more updates on this story and free news alerts for your neighborhood, sign up for your local Middle Tennessee Patch morning newsletter.) Retic and his alleged victim were drinking and doing drugs in the womans Buena Vista Pike apartment back in January, she told police. Suddenly, Retic became paranoid and accused the woman of stealing from him, and then began vandalizing her walls by punching them and damaging her television with a skillet, according to a police report. The woman said Retic punched her, beat her with a rod, threw her on a couch and began to choke her. After dragging her to the bedroom, Retic continued the assault, hitting the woman with a milk crate, according to the affidavit. He then forced the woman in a closet, holding her there for some time, before dragging her out of the closet, only to bind her with an extension cord and whip her with another extension cord, she told police. Then, just as suddenly as he began, Retic realized what he was doing and untied the woman, who then fled the apartment to look for help as Retic had taken her cell phone. Retic is charged with especially aggravated kidnapping, two counts of aggravated assault, interfering with an emergency call and vandalism and is being held on a $202,000 bond.

1939,"The man accused of kidnapping a Georgetown University student and forcing him to try to withdraw cash at multiple ATMs was caught over 3,000 miles away in Seattle on Friday, according to reports. The FBI found Paolo Aldorasi, 34, in Seattle by using surveillance video, car rental records, his Facebook page and data from license plate readers, NBC Washington reports. Aldorasi, who is originally from Italy but lives in London, faces a federal kidnapping charge and a maximum sentence of life in prison for the January 26 incident. Police say Aldorasi allegedly approached the Georgetown student — who is Korean and speaks limited English — in the 3400 block of O Street NW, asked him where Dulles airport was and forced him into a vehicle.

Reports say Aldorasi allegedly asked the student for $2,800. The student took out his wallet, but once Aldorasi saw his debit card he began to drive him to banks. Aldorasi drove the student to three different ATMs in Georgetown; the Cartier store in Chevy Chase; an ATM in the Tenleytown neighborhood of DC; and a Best Buy store in Tenleytown. The student tried to take out money multiple times, but the transactions didnt go through. Aldorasi tried to get the student to buy a $6,300 bracelet at Cartier, and his card was declined again. The same incident happened at the Best Buy, when the student tried to buy cellphones that totaled $846. The man didnt get any money from the Georgetown student, although he held him for two hours, officials said.

1940,"An ex-felon convicted of murdering a housemate over a $10 Internet bill was sentenced Thursday to 158 years to life in state prison. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Norm Shapiro imposed the term on Kenneth Theodrick Parks, 57, who was found guilty Sept. 10 of first-degree murder for the April 14, 2014, killing of Terri Smith, 42, who was shot once in the back at a home in the Hyde Park area. Parks also was convicted of the attempted murder of the womans boyfriend, who survived being shot twice. Jurors found that Parks had personally used and discharged a handgun and that he had inflicted great bodily injury on the womans boyfriend. The six-man, six-woman panel acquitted him of two counts of attempted murder and the lesser counts of attempted voluntary manslaughter involving the womans 11-year-old daughter and 20-month-old son, who were not wounded. During a 911 call, the womans daughter identified Parks as the gunman and pleaded for help for her mother, according to Deputy District Attorney Joshua Ritter. Parks was arrested that day by Los Angeles police after locking himself inside his bedroom at the home, according to the prosecutor.  Parks sentence on the murder count was tripled because he had three prior strikes involving his 1982 conviction for forcible oral copulation, kidnapping and robbery stemming from one incident. --City News Service",0
1941,"Two men pleaded not guilty Wednesday in Sonoma County Superior Court to kidnapping a San Francisco woman and sexually assaulting her during a ride to Sonoma in April. Fredi A. Lopez-Flores, 33, of Novato, and Alejandro May Quintero, 24, of Sonoma, are charged with kidnapping to commit a crime and forced rape, sodomy and oral copulation on April 14. Their preliminary hearing is scheduled for Oct. 12. The men allegedly picked up a woman at Stanyan and Fulton streets in San Francisco as she waited for a ride-hailing company driver to take her home from a bar. Quintero forced her into a Dodge and attacked and sexually assaulted her as Lopez-Flores drove to Sonoma and after they arrived there, according to the Sonoma County Sheriffs Office. Lopez-Flores bought a condom at a gas station in Sonoma and sexually assaulted the woman in the Dodge, the sheriffs office said. The woman escaped the vehicle around 5 a.m. with the help of a Safeway store employee. Sheriffs detectives reviewed surveillance camera video from businesses and bridges in the Bay Area. Video at the Golden Gate Bridge and Sonoma businesses showed a black Dodge Magnum with a blue neon license plate light, the sheriffs office said. A flier with a picture of the Dodge was sent to law enforcement agencies in the Bay Area, and a Novato police officer recognized the vehicle from an unrelated arrest that entailed towing Lopez-Flores car, sheriffs Sgt. Spencer Crum said. Data from Lopez-Flores cellphone company indicated he was in the area of San Francisco on April 14 where the woman was forced into the vehicle and at the time the Dodge arrived in Sonoma, Crum said. Lopez-Flores was arrested at his job in San Rafael on June 1, and Quintero was arrested June 2 at a Sonoma car wash where he worked, Crum said. Both men are being held in the Sonoma County jail.

1942,"A Sacramento County man accused of an assault and attempted robbery in Dublin last month is also a suspect in the kidnapping of a Vallejo woman in March, according to an FBI affidavit unsealed today. The reported kidnapping of Denise Huskins, 30, from the residence of her boyfriend on Mare Island early on March 23 was initially described two days later by Vallejo police as unsubstantiated and apparently an orchestrated event and not a kidnapping. Huskins was found on the morning of March 25 near her mothers house in Huntington Beach, where she said the kidnappers dropped her off after holding her in an unknown location for two days. Police said on the evening of that day that Huskins and her boyfriend, Aaron Quinn, appeared to have sent investigators on a wild goose chase and that there was no evidence to support the claim that this was a stranger abduction or an abduction at all. But FBI agent Jason Walter said in an affidavit filed in federal court in Sacramento on June 29 that he believes there is probable cause to believe that Matthew Muller, 38, of Orangevale in Sacramento County, carried out the kidnapping of Huskins. Muller was arrested by Alameda County sheriffs deputies at his mothers home in South Lake Tahoe on June 8 in connection with the June 5 home-invasion-style burglary of a Dublin residence. Walter wrote that when arrested, Muller told deputies that he was a former Marine who served from 1995 to 1999 and later attended Harvard University from 2003 to 2006. He told deputies he suffered from Gulf War illness and problems with psychosis and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2008, the affidavit said. Walter noted that California State Bar records show that a Matthew D. Muller attended Harvard Law School and was disbarred from law practice in the state in 2015. The records show that Matthew D. Muller received his undergraduate degree from Pomona College. Muller is currently in custody and is charged by Alameda County prosecutors with first degree burglary, attempted first degree robbery and assault with a deadly weapon for allegedly hitting one of the owners of the Dublin home on the head with a metal flashlight during a struggle. A cellphone left behind when the invader fled from that house was traced to Mullers Orangevale address, Walter wrote. Assistant District Attorney Teresa Drenick said Mullers preliminary hearing in the Dublin case is scheduled for Aug. 27. Walters affidavit was filed in a separate federal case in which the FBI was seeking a search warrant to seize evidence potentially related to the Vallejo case. Court records show that the search was authorized on June 29 and executed on June 30. Gina Swankie, a spokeswoman for the FBIs Sacramento office, said the investigation is active and ongoing and said she could not comment further. Huskins and Quinn, both physical therapists who met while working at Kaiser Hospital in Vallejo, told investigators that at least two people invaded Quinns house in the early morning hours of March 23. They said they were drugged, had their wrists bound with zip ties and made to wear swim goggles in which the lenses were taped over, according to the affidavit. Huskins said she was transported in a car trunk to an unknown location before being taken to Huntington Beach and dropped off there. Walters said in the affidavit that evidence previously seized from Mullers mothers home on June 8 included swim goggles with taped lenses and a long blond hair similar to Huskins hair; a laptop computer of the same type reported stolen by Quinn; zip ties; and a white Fort Mustang stolen from another person in Vallejo on Jan. 3. The stolen car had Mullers drivers license under the seat and its navigation system history showed a search for the Huntington Beach street where Huskins was dropped off, Walter said. A report filed in court on the June 30 search said that 31 items of new evidence seized from the South Lake Tahoe address included a laptop, a notebook, duct tape, bedding and a zip tie with possible hair attached. Mullers mother told sheriffs detectives that he resides primarily in the South Lake Tahoe home. The affidavit cites two lengthy anonymous messages sent to the San Francisco Chronicle on March 26 and 28 in which the sender said the kidnapping was not a hoax and that the kidnappers felt sorry for Huskins, admired her courage, felt deep remorse and decided to free her. The messages said the group of three kidnappers had intended to kidnap Quinns ex-fiancee, who looked like Huskins, and that they did realize not until after the invasion that Huskins was not that person. The document also cites two anonymous messages sent to Vallejo police Lt. Kenny Park on March 30 and 31 demanding that police issue a full apology to Huskins and Quinn for having insinuated they created their predicament. Huskins attorney, Douglas Rappaport, said today that Vallejo police not only owed Huskins an apology, but owed everyone an apology for allowing a kidnapper to roam free while publicly accusing their victims of lying. The kidnappers were at liberty to continue on their crime spree and in fact did, Rappaport said. Rather than properly investigate the case, Vallejo police investigators re-victimized Huskins, he said. Quinns attorney, Daniel Russo, said at this point an apology is no good and said Vallejo police should not work earnestly to find the other kidnappers. What I want Vallejo police to do is to do their job. Go out, find out if theres other guys, get them in custody as soon as possible, and make sure next time they think before they talk, Russo said. The statements by Vallejo police alleging the two made up the story has led to them being questioned relentlessly both publicly and personally, including by employers and potential employers, the attorneys said. Neither attorney would comment on wither they would seek civil damages against Vallejo police, saying they were both criminal defense lawyers and would not be involved in a civil case. Huskins and Quinn appeared at a news conference with their attorneys in Vallejo this afternoon but declined to give a public statement or discuss the facts of the case. Quinn learned of the FBIs arrest on Friday, Russo said. Neither lawyer has been able to reach Vallejo police today, they said. --Bay City News",1

1944,"FAIRFAX, Va. — After an Amber Alert is blasted across the state for a missing child reportedly abducted by her mother Wednesday morning, TV crews went to work talking to neighbors. These conversations tend to lean to sidewalk analysis of the suspect or what kind of neighbor they were. Rarely do these interviews end in another state, with the reporter and cameraman helping to recover the abducted 6-week old baby as law enforcement carries off the babys mother, Flora Khatun. Andrea McCarren and photojournalist Dave Satchell at WUSA9 had interviewed a few people around Khatuns home in Annandale when one neighbor told the reporter an address in Hyattsville, Md., where Khatun may have taken the baby. But the neighbor didnt want to speak to police. All I kept thinking was Journalist. Humanity. News. The safety of a baby, McCarren said in a WUSA9 report. She shared the address with police before heading to the location, 45 minutes away. When the TV crew arrived, a car sought by police in the case was found in the parking lot. This was the key to the missing 6-week-old baby, McCarren said. Read more about the discovery and eventual arrest at WUSA9. PHOTO of Flora Khatun courtesy of Fairfax County Police",1

Andrew Castro told detectives he planned to kidnap, rape and kill a baby, and to also murder the childs mother. One of the detectives said he believes God sent him to Castros home to take him into custody. The judge still let Castro off with probation. Has it been a year already? Alexander Cook didnt exactly put his best foot forward in 2016. Ringing in the New Year at Skooters in Shorewood, he wanted to get the bartenders attention and decided the best way to go about that was to throw a beer bottle at his head. Cook missed. He also went to jail. Sayannee Kim assured a former co-worker who was looking to get married that she could find him a bride from Cambodia. The Naperville man shelled out nearly $40,000 for the arranged the marriage and for a while it looked like an OK deal. Until it turned out the bride-to-be didnt actually exist. When he was locked up on a murder case, Daeviontae Pruitte was recorded in telephone conversations referring to himself as the killer and the little killer. The judge still found Pruitte not guilty and he got out of jail. Not even a year later, Pruitte was arrested for allegedly stealing a cell phone. While he was in jail for that, the Little Killer was charged with trying to kill somebody else. Hes still in jail. Drew Peterson was put on trial for supposedly trying to orchestrate the murder of Will County States Attorney James Glasgow from behind the walls of Menard Correctional Center. The prosecutions big witness was a prison snitch named Antonio Beast Smith, who wore a wire to record hours of conversations with Peterson. In all those long talks, Peterson never asked to have Glasgow killed. The jury still found him guilty. And then he got more time for supposedly talking about having Glasgow killed than he did for actually killing his third wife, Kathleen Savio. The last two Miley Cyrus Boys were found guilty after trials in 2016. Daniel Lahey put his fate in the hands of a jury. Robert Krapil left it up to a judge. The pivotal witness was Donnie Rice, the stepfather of Letys Place bartender Danielle McCalla. Rice spoke up when he saw a man hit with an unprovoked punch and then viciously kicked and stomped after he slumped to the barroom floor, telling the attackers, Thats enough. You two are a piece of s---. Rice said the Miley Cyrus Boys then went after him. A city councilman walks into a bar. He gets slapped in the face and his nose bleeds all over his shirt. The guy who did it — real estate broker Mark Koenig — only gets charged with shouting and pointing at him. Even though video released by the city clearly shows Koenig hauling off and hitting Councilman Larry Hug at least three times. Koenig pleads guilty and pays $500. What? The judge warned Brittany Hutcheson, but she just kept talking anyway. And then she went to jail. She was a smashing success story, the poster child for the Will County States Attorneys special drug court program. Not only did Elizabeth Johnson graduate, she went to law school and got a job at the states attorneys office. After she left, she ran for Grundy County States Attorney. She lost in the primary. Then she was charged with fleeing the scene of an accident after allegedly bragging about being a lawyer. And then she got caught with pot after she resisted arrest when her boyfriend called the cops because she wouldnt go away, police said. And then she skipped court. And then she got into even more trouble. Scott Talbert claims there was blood in his jail-issued underwear and that when he asked for some bloodless undergarments (a reasonable request), a guard turned him down, essentially explaining that it was his problem. So Talbert sued the sheriff and the county jail. How do you win back a ladys heart when she leaves you? You send her dad a video of you having sex with her. Wait, no. Thats a terrible idea. But Nicholas Jocius didnt figure that out until it was too late. Darla Waldrop admits she hates cops and that she told them so. But she denies threatening to blow the head off one, which is what they charged her with. Waldrop said she only called the cops in the first place because she had been sexually assaulted, and that they were of no help, that they treated (her) like crap and looked down at her. Michael Wardog Reid was a mixed martial arts fighter and bouncer at Skooters Roadhouse when he and a man identified as either his stepbrother or half brother got into it with a couple guys in the parking lot after closing time, according to police. Then they followed the men to a nearby Burger King, police said, and nearly beat one of them to death. You know what it takes to be the states No. 1 most wanted fugitive? You can start by allegedly punching a man in the face outside a grocery store, then breaking a window and damaging furniture at tax preparation business, vandalizing a womans Chevy Blazer, and finally pulling down your boxer shorts, to expose yourself and arouse or satisfy your sexual desire. Then, of course, you have to take off and lie low. At least thats how it worked out for Sidney J. Moore-Walters, according to the police. He made it all the way to the top. This is Jessie Robinson. The police said they caught her with 45 crack rocks in her vagina. That sounds like a lot. Ambrea Otte and Nicholas Keto both got arrested in 2016. And they both went on Facebook to let all their friends know about it as they were taken into custody. Just moments before she was hauled off to the county jail, Otte managed to post, Getting held and booked for loving my kids too much. Karma is going to hit this piece of s--- so hard. Cant wait to finally be done with this abusive, homosexual disgrace. Keto put up two posts before he was taken away, saying, Going to jail and I f---d up they taking my fone.",0

1951,"Sign up for the Canton-Sixes Patch newsletter! ---- A Canton mother and her son are safe after police tracked down and arrested the man accused of kidnapping the pair from their home. Mario Arcenio Perez-Perez, 24, of Hiram is charged with two counts of kidnapping, obstruction or hindering a 911 call, simple battery, reckless conduct and terroristic threats, Canton police said Monday. The incident unfolded Sunday, April 24 when a Canton police officer was dispatched around 4 a.m. to meet with counterpart with Cobb County police at RaceTrac on Bells Ferry Road near Interstate 575. The Cobb officer told the Canton cop he had been dispatched earlier and met with the woman, who said she and her son were forced into the suspects vehicle in Canton near her residence, Canton police said. The officer learned the woman and her son were initially driven by the suspect to QuikTrip near the RaceTrac when she was able to convince the man she had to use the restroom. Once inside the store, the woman went into the restroom and stayed inside the facility until the store clerk made a welfare check on her. The victim told the clerk what happened, and the clerk was able to hide the woman and her son behind the stores coolers until a friend was able to retrieve them. The friend took the pair across the street to the RaceTrac convenience store where they called police. Through interviews and follow-up investigative work, a detective was able to track down Perez-Perez leaving a church in Marietta just after noon on Sunday. Marietta police conducted a traffic stop, and were able to apprehend the suspect. We are extremely grateful the victim and her son were able to elude the suspect in the case and get away from him with the help of a friend and a concerned store clerk, Canton Police Chief Mark Mitchell said. Our responding officers and investigating detective worked hard in their response, investigation and arrest of this individual, which brought a successful resolution to this criminal act. From what police can determine, the suspect and victim were acquaintances who knew each other from church, Mitchell added. Perez-Perez remains held at the Cherokee County Adult Detention Center with $58,850 bond. --- Photo: Mario Arcenio Perez-Perez. Credit: Cherokee Sheriffs Office",1
1952,"- A patient at Delnor Hospital is claiming she now suffers from post-traumatic disorder after an inmate held two nurses hostage while she was receiving treatment there this past May, the Daily Herald reports. Victoria Weiland filed a lawsuit this past week in federal court against Kane County, Kane County jail guard Shawn Loomis and Apex3 Security LLC. She says she was a patient on the third floor of the hospital when an inmate, Tywon Salters, was left unshackled and escaped. One of the nurses that was held hostage on May 8 was beaten, tortured and raped, a lawyer for the nurse said earlier this year. Attorney Sean Murray said corrections staff responsible for guarding Tywon Salters, 21, fell asleep on the job, left him unshackled for long periods of time and were often seen watching TV or on their phones while on duty at the hospital. Murray got away and took two different nurses hostage. Salters, 21, was shot that same day when the Kane County SWAT team rushed the hospital. The two nurses held hostage as well as other nurses have sued already sued the county, Loomis and Apex3, according to the Daily Herald. Weilands suit is seeking unspecified damages.

1953,"Child neglect and parental abduction charges will stand against Catherine Hoggle, the mentally ill mother accused of taking her two children from home in September 2014 and concealing their whereabouts -- and their father worries the youngsters were killed. A Rockville judge on Monday denied a motion by Hoggles attorney to throw out the charges against her. Catherines family says she is paranoid and was making plans to leave the area to avoid being hospitalized, so she gave the young children to someone for safekeeping. Her daughter Sarah, who turned 5 on Friday, and son Jacob, 3, disappeared 14 months ago. Authorities say Jacob was last seen with his mother on Sept. 7, 2014, in Darnestown or Clarksburg; Sarah was last seen with Hoggle on the morning of Sept. 8, 2014. WTOP reports Hoggle – who has been deemed incompetent to stand trial in the case of the missing children -- will continue treatment at the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center in Jessup, Maryland. A new competency hearing for Hoggle, 29, will be held at 9 a.m. Feb. 22 in Montgomery County District Court. The childrens father and Hoggles common-law husband, Troy Turner, told reporters Monday that hes frustrated by the court hearings, which dont seem to put the whereabouts of his children first. Theres a distinct possibility that she killed my children, she denied that again, he said Monday in an interview recorded by Montgomery Community Media. SEE ALSO: Catherines mother, Lindsey Hoggle, told reporters Monday that her daughters progress toward competency has sharply declined since a September hearing. Catherine is afraid to go to jail, said Lindsey Hoggle, who believes Catherine feels safe at the state hospital. Her attorney, David Felsen, said that Catherine Hoggle is confused, and appears unable to understand the charges against her. Because she is working with doctors, and taking medication, the charges against her should be dropped rather than prolonging the case and her confinement, he said. Father Frustrated By Stalemate Turner said he called Catherine on Friday, Sarahs fifth birthday, in hopes that she might tell him what happened to the children. He says that she told him shes being advised to act incompetent so she wont go to jail. My two kids are missing, theyre gone, theyre not here. I dont understand how that all of that gets left out of this and what becomes important is her mental status. I really dont care about her mental status at this point, I want my children home. As far as charges go I dont care about that, I want my children home, Turner said. While Turner says the states attorney would drop charges if the children are returned safely, Catherines attorney is telling her thats not true, he said, and that other criminal charges are threatened. When Catherine asked Turner about their older son, he said he wont give her any information about the boy until Sarah and Jacob are home. Hoggle, a schizophrenic, refuses to tell Turner, her mother, or Montgomery County Police where the children are. She says the children are safe. Her mother says Catherine wanted to escape from a possible involuntary commitment to such a facility, so she took the children as part of that plan to leave. Medical professionals say she could improve to a point where she could stand trial. Turner previously said, The worst days of my life would be Nov. 20 and July 3, where its their birthdays, and theyre not there. Related Stories: Family Asks for Tips Turners older son continues to be positive about his siblings return home, as are other family members, who remain steadfast in their belief that the children are alive, while police are not optimistic about the youngsters fate. The childrens grandmother, Lindsey Hoggle, posted Thursday on the FindSarahFindJacob Facebook page, Sweet baby Sarah - will be 5 years old tomorrow. We appeal to anyone who has seen anything to share tips. Family members ask anyone in the Clarksburg area who may have seen Sarah and Jacob to message the Facebook page, call or text (301) 549-9044 or submit a tip on the website www.findsarahfindjacob.com. Tips can be made anonymously. Catherine Hoggles attorney told WTOP she suffers from a mental illness so severe that she may not remember what happened to her children. While he believes his children are alive, Turner wants to know if they are dead. At this point, the youngsters have likely been passed around to multiple locations, their father says, and even their mother would be unable to tell authorities where the children are. On Facebook, Lindsey Hoggle has thanked people for sharing information about the search for the youngsters, and asked that readers continue to spread the word. More Court Appearances Prosecutors said in May they might pursue additional charges against Hoggle. Montgomery County Police believe the children are dead, while the extended Hoggle family disagrees. In a Facebook post early in June, the Hoggle family said: Sarah (age 4) and Jacob (age 2 1/2) have been missing 9 months today. Their mother continues to state that they are with someone. There is no evidence or proof to believe otherwise - so we will continue to consider them MISSING. Please keep in mind they may look differently and be anywhere in or outside of Maryland. Thank you for continued diligence! We will find them.  »Photo of Sarah and Jacob Hoggle, courtesy of the FindSarahFindJacob Facebook page",1

1955,"Two Marlboro teens have been charged with kidnapping and making terroristic threats after they grabbed a male victim and threatened to shoot him in an attempt to find another man who allegedly stiffed them on drug deal, Howell police said. Moamen Abdelmeguid, 18, and his 16-year-old accomplice, both of Marlboro, were arrested Thursday, Howell Detective Sgt. Christian Antunez said. Police are not releasing the 16-year-olds name due to his age, Antunez said. Abdelmeguid and the 16-year-old came to the Windmill Club development in Howell about 6:30 p.m. on Thursday to buy drugs from Joseph Arnold, 19, of Howell, Antunez said. Abdelmeguid and his accomplice gave Arnold money for drugs but Arnold took the money and ran without giving them the drugs, Antunez said. Infuriated, Abdelmeguid and the 16-year-old went looking for Arnold to get their drugs or get their money back, Antunez said. They went to a home Arnold said was his address, but the home was that of a male who has no relationship whatsoever to any of the involved parties, Antunez said. Arnold had given Abdelmeguid and the 16-year-old a fake address, he said. The victim told police the suspects grabbed the victim in a choke hold and forced him into the back of their car against his will, Antunez said. They then threatened to shoot the victim if he didnt turn Arnold over to them, he said. Despite the victims insistence that he did not know Arnold, Abdelmeguid and the 16-year-old drove the victim around the neighborhood for about five minutes, looking for Arnold, Antunez said. Abdelmeguid and the 16-year-old returned to the victims house and forced the victim to allow them into his home to search for Arnold, who they never located, Antunez said. Abdelmeguid and the 16-year-old left the area, and the victim immediately went to headquarters to notify police, he said. The victim did not sustain any injuries in the assault, Antunez said. Detectives Robert Ortenzi, Eric Encarnacion and David Gilliland and Patrolman James Conaty Jr. investigated and arrested Abdelmeguid and the 16-year-old and charged them with kidnapping, terroristic threats, burglary, simple assault and drug-related offenses, Antunez said. They also found and arrested Arnold and charged him with conspiracy to distribute a controlled dangerous substance and theft, Antunez said. Abdelmeguid was taken to the Monmouth County Correctional Institute in Freehold Township; the 16-year-old was released to his parents, and Arnold was released with criminal summonses, Antunez said.

1956,"Seven teenage boys allegedly involved in a brutal assault on a Squantum Point Park pier that was caught on camera will faces charges. The Massachusetts State Police announced Wednesday that they are seeking criminal complaints against the teens for violently attacking a group of five teenagers on July 31. The group, consisting of a 17-year-old boy from Quincy, three 16-year-old boys from Quincy, two 15-year-old boys from Quincy; and a 14-year-old boy from Kingston, all face 18 counts each of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, assault and battery, assault, and kidnapping. On July 31, officers responded to a report of an incident involving a large group of teens. Quincy officers arrived on scene within minutes of the initial call, but there was no ongoing disorder by the time they showed up. Quincy police cleared the scene at 5:49 p.m. A 97-second video of the incident circulating on social media starts with a group of teens confronting another group on the pier in broad daylight, telling them to start walking as they start attacking the victims, throwing them to the ground while using inappropriate language. At one point a person is kicked multiple times while laying on the pier. An extensive police investigation determined that the suspects punched, kicked, and tackled various members of the victims group, and prevented them from initially leaving the pier, allowing the aggressors to launch their assault. All seven have been charged as a principal in certain offenses and as a joint-venture in others. The assault and battery with a dangerous weapon charges stem from defendants kicking victims with shod feet. The kidnapping charges stem from the defendants refusing to allow the victims to leave the pier, police said. The teens will be arraigned in Quincy District Court on a date to be determined. Due to the age of the victims and suspects, no names have been released. The victims were identified as a group of teens 14 to 16 years old. Image via Shutterstock",1

1960,"The civilian panel that oversees the Los Angeles Police Department approved a drone pilot program Tuesday -- several months after the department first presented what it called a limited plan to use the technology. Approval of the program by the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners came despite opposition from activists who consider the technology a threat to civil liberties and after only 6 percent of the 1,675 emails the LAPD received about the program expressed support for it. Commissioner Cynthia McClain-Hill voted against the program, while Commission President Steve Soboroff, Vice President Matthew Johnson and Commissioner Sandra Figueroa-Villa voted for it. Commissioner Shane Murphy Goldsmith was not present for the vote. The panels vote prompted an outcry from opponents, some of whom marched outside the LAPD headquarters and into the intersection of First and Main streets, blocking traffic. Police declared the gathering an unlawful assembly, ordering the group out of the street. Several protesters were seen being handcuffed and led away by police, although it was unclear if they were only being detained to move them out of the street or if they would be arrested. The commission held a meeting two weeks ago, when it approved guidelines for the 1-year drone pilot program. The guidelines were then posted on the departments website for two weeks to get more public feedback before the final vote. The commission first heard a presentation on the guidelines in August, and the department held four public meetings to get feedback. Approval of a drone program -- or unmanned aerial system, as the department calls it -- comes after the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department Civilian Oversight Commission recently voted 5-4 to call for the grounding of the LASDs drone program, although Sheriff Jim McDonnell said the program would continue. According to the guidelines the Police Commission approved, drones would be used in a limited capacity, including high-risk tactical operations, barricaded armed suspect responses, hostage rescues, and situations involving threats of exposure to hazardous materials and the need to detect explosive devices. The drones would not be weaponized or used during surveillance, and their use would have be approved on a case-by-case basis. The commission also added several more amendments before the final vote, including that facial recognition technology would not be used on the drones. The LAPDs pursuit of a pilot program is a reversal of its policy after it abandoned the idea of using drones three years ago in the face of protests from activists. Members of the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, the Drone-Free LAPD/No Drones, LA! Campaign, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and other civil rights organizations have been vocal about their opposition to the program over concerns that mission creep will lead to the devices one day being armed or used for surveillance to infringe on privacy rights. Drones represent a significant threat to privacy, one that is very difficult to contain once drones are deployed for any use whatsoever, said Melanie Ochoa, an ACLU staff attorney, at a commission meeting in August. The groups have also charged that because the emails the LAPD received on the program were overwhelmingly negative, the commission is not interested in the public feedback it is receiving and is just going through the motions. The Los Angeles City Council cleared the way in June for the citys fire department to begin using drones. A Los Angeles Fire Department report addressed the issue of privacy concerns and said the devices would not be used to monitor or provide surveillance for law enforcement.

1961,"The man who orchestrated an elaborate scheme to kidnap a man and steal $1.8 million in cryptocurrency holdings pleaded guilty Wednesday, the Manhattan District Attorneys office announced. Louis Meza, 35, hired three associates to kidnap a man and drive him around Uptown Manhattan while he gained access to the victims apartment and digital wallet, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree grand larceny and one count of second-degree kidnapping — both felonies — prosecutors said. Louis Meza orchestrated a 21st-century stick-up, District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., said in a statement. Then 21st-century investigators brought him swiftly to justice, securing a landmark conviction in an undeveloped area of the law. Meza hired Cesar Fuego Guzman, Allen Joker Nunez and Darrel Bishop Colon to help kidnap a man in a man in November of 2017 after learning of the victims vast holdings in the cryptocurrency Ether, prosecutors said. Meza arranged a meeting with the victim on Nov. 4 and insisted that the victim take a car service back to his Manhattan home, prosecutors said. Meza then directed the victim to get into a waiting minivan, in which Guzman, Nunez and Colon were lying in wait, prosecutors said. Nunez posed as a car service driver and began driving the victim to Uptown Manhattan when Colon, hiding in the rear of the vehicle, jumped out and threatened the victim with a gun, prosecutors said. Colon forced the victim to hand over his phone, wallet, house keys and password to his digital wallet which were handed of to Meza and Guzman, prosecutors said. Meza gained access to the digital wallet using the password obtained by Colon and transferred the $1.8 million in Ether into his personal account, police said. Hired goons Guzman, Nunez and Colon were indicted in June, prosecutors said. The victim was eventually able to escape from the minivan and call police, prosecutors said. His identity was not revealed and the stolen funds were eventually returned to the man. Photo by r.classen/Shutterstock",1
1962,"Hennepin County is in the midst of investigating —in which a Golden Valley police officer shot and killed a woman who reportedly got out of her vehicle with a handgun. Such shootings are rare—Hopkins hasnt had an officer-involved shooting in about 50 years—but they also create questions among the public. Patch sat down with Hopkins Police Sgt. Michael Glassberg to discuss when officers draw their guns and when they pull the trigger, how they train and what a typical police gunfight looks like. The conversation offers an in-depth look at Hopkins policies on firearms and deadly force. (Glassberg, as a Hopkins officer, is not in a position to comment on any specifics of the Golden Valley shooting.) *** Hopkins Patch: First of all, why do officers carry handguns and how do handguns differ from nonlethal equipment?  Sgt. Michael Glassberg: Handguns are for stopping great bodily harm and lethal confrontations that officers may be exposed to. We are charged with responding to very violent situations—some of which, unfortunately, force us to use deadly force. Hopkins Patch: And how are they different from a Taser or something. Glassberg: A Taser is strictly used for nonlethal force. At times, we will attempt to use a Taser first in lethal situations as long as we have lethal cover, like a handgun or rifle. But the Taser has no place in a situation where an officer is being faced with potential lethal force against us or against a civilian. The Taser has a tendency to potentially fail if you dont get a good hit due to clothing or other factors. Hopkins Patch: What kind of training do yall undergo on how to use your handguns? Glassberg: Our firearms training is consistent with state-required mandates. As a department, we shoot our firearms at least four times a year. And these are not just stand-and-shoots. A lot of it is moving and shooting, going to cover, reloading, judgment shooting. We do a lot of judgment shooting using video systems. We also use simunition (non-lethal training ammunition), where were actually doing live scenarios with role players. Well shoot some of the role players with simunitions similar to [paintball]. What weve found over the years is very few police shootings are point and shoot. A lot of times its moving, and we want our officers to be accurate for moving and shooting because most gunfights are going to be some type of movement. Rarely does a suspect stand still during a firefight. This training is over and above what each officer has to do when they go to what we call skills—the police academy. They go through basically a semester of firearms where they get familiarized with deadly force laws and the use of the handgun, maintenance of the handgun. We continue that. Each year, we review the deadly force statutes, state use-of-force statutes. We talk about maintenance. And we always are changing up our shooting scenarios so its always different because in real life, youre presented with various different situations. Hopkins Patch: What types of situations will prompt an officer to draw his weapon—maybe not fire, but draw his weapon? Glassberg: Any time theres a potential for lethal force or great bodily harm used on an officer. Commonly, people will see officers on the scene of a burglary alarm. Well, it may not be a real burglary, but our weapon is out because we want to have it out and ready in the event there is a burglar inside. We know that burglars like to carry weapons. Any type of in-progress felonies where its like a person crime. Any time where we have any inkling there may be a weapon involved. Any time theres going to be any type of weapon involved, were going to escalate to deadly force, the majority of the time. Hopkins Patch: Tell me what that means. If you see someone with a weapon? Glassberg: If we go to an assault where theres a report of a knife involved, a bat involved, or maybe this persons got a bottle. Were going to have our weapon out on those type of situations. Hopkins Patch: What would prompt an officer to cross the line from having the weapon out and actually pulling the trigger? Glassberg: When they are directly threatened with lethal force or great bodily harm or to protect another from great bodily harm or lethal force or basically to apprehend a suspect who I reasonably believe is going to (cause lethal force or great bodily harm to someone else). To put it in laymans terms, lets say I see a suspect running toward a daycare center with a gun in his hand. Even though I may have to shoot him in the back, its completely justified because whats the alternative? He runs into the daycare center with a gun. Thats the easiest scenario for people to understand. Or if I know that this guys just shot an officer. Even though hes running away from me, I already know hes shot one officer—hes shot one person—I can use deadly force on him even though Im not directly threatened at that point. Hopkins Patch: Does the presence of a handgun constitute a risk of great bodily harm? If I have one in my hand and youre trying to arrest me— Glassberg: Absolutely. Oh yes, absolutely. Without a doubt. If someones got a handgun in their hand, they are going to be taken down by officers with their weapons out. Im not saying theyre going to shoot them—depending on if the officer has cover. But the officer will have their weapon out, and that weapon will be pointed at the person with the handgun. That is pretty much black and white. Even if its a knife or a handgun, you can expect the officers to respond with the weapon pointed at that person and prepared to fire if need be. Hopkins Patch: Whats the thinking behind doing that? If someone has a handgun, why not try to coax it out of them by voice? Glassberg: Obviously because theres too much risk. Reaction is always slower than action, and the person with the handgun knows in their mind what theyre going to do. So again, reaction is slower than action. So if our guns not out, were already behind the eight ball—were already disadvantaged—because that person has the gun out. They can fire at us quicker than we can draw. Even if my weapons pointed at them, theyre going to get the round off. With knives, it used to be a 21-foot rule. If someone had a knife and they were within 21 feet of you—and Ive seen this done in studies with a rubber knife—that person can run at you and get one slice or stab on you before you can draw your weapon and fire accurately. Thats now been increased closer to 30 feet to make it safer for the officers. Hopkins Patch: Why not shoot the gun out of their hand or shoot them in the kneecap? Glassberg: That looks real good in the movies, but what we know from studies is police accuracy in gunfights is below 30 percent because of the stress and the adrenaline. Thats why we try to really put some adrenaline and stress on our officers during our firearms training—by running around and getting that adrenaline going—because you see the accuracy just start to drop because youre shaking a little bit. Its hard enough to hit center mass (a persons body) during a police gunfight—let alone an arm or hand. And the problem is, if you miss, where does that round go? Is it going to hit the innocent bystander? Were trained to shoot for center mass for two reasons. First of all, its the largest area of the body and also thats the best area to incapacitate someone who is a threat to you. And you dont want to, in a firefight, try to shoot for an arm or a hand or a leg. Thats not going to incapacitate them. Weve seen studies, Ive seen videos, of people thatve been shot multiple times—and what should be deadly shots—and theyre still continuing to fight with the officers or theyre still continuing to shoot back at the officers. Its not like the movies where we see one shot and people fall and die. Thats not reality. Hopkins Patch: How does this policy compare to others across the state and the country? Glassberg: Center mass is pretty much standard nationwide. I dont know of any agency that would be training their officers to shoot for extremities. In advanced SWAT training for snipers, they do practice for headshots but that would be the extent of it. Hopkins Patch: And of course, thats a rifle not a handgun. Glassberg: Thats a rifle not a handgun. Your accuracy, obviously, is tremendously better with a rifle. If I have a handgun and my only shot is a headshot—because the person may be blocked or they have a hostage—and Im forced into a situation, then, yes, we will (take a headshot). We do practice headshots. However, our preferred target zone is center mass. Hopkins Patch: How long will a typical gunfight take place? Glassberg: They are less than three seconds. The average police gunfight is less than three seconds, and I think the majority of them are 13 feet or less. Hopkins Patch: What does that mean for an officer? Glassberg: Usually when you have a deadly force encounter it is so fast that you dont have a long time to make that decision. You have to recognize the threat, draw your weapon, get a sight picture and fire. So basically, I walk into a room and all of a sudden someone pulls a weapon on me—and again, its that action is quicker than reaction, so theyre already going to have the advantage. Thats why we practice so much from the holster. We draw and fire. Thats a major part of our training because the majority of shootings youre going to be drawing from the holster and finding your target and firing those shots. Hopkins Patch: How is a gunfight different from hunting or something like that? Glassberg: The main thing is the animals—youre not being shot back at or theyre not a threat to you directly. Obviously , there are certain situations where a person is confronted by, like, a grizzly bear. But the majority of it, hunters have the time. Theyre out there with their scopes. Theyre in a somewhat controlled environment—you know, theyre up in a tree. They can track the animal. They can choose when they have to take the shot. The officers arent going to have a choice because its a lethal threat and, if they want to defend their life or someone else, its happening now. Hopkins Patch: What happens in an officers mind after the incident happens? Glassberg: Well first of all, it has to go without saying that this is a tremendously stressful incident, obviously, for the officer, the department and the community. The officer generally is immediately removed from duty. They provide an official statement at some point during the first 24 to 48 hours. They are provided with legal counsel and are provided with critical incident stress management techniques. They may meet with a critical incident stress management debriefing team. Prior to returning for duty, depending on the department, they might meet with a specially trained psychologist. But they are afforded all the time that they need to recover from being involved in this traumatic incident. We know that a lot of officers that are involved in deadly force encounters get out of law enforcement as a career because of the stress. And a lot of times, it may not be on them, but it may be their family. It was so stressful on their family that they dont want to go through with that. We try to prepare for that mentally. However, I dont think thats something you can prepare for without having some type of residual scarring. A lot of officers recover just fine from it, but there is a group of officers—and rightfully so—have a hard time recovering from it and move on to a different career. Hopkins Patch: How many officers will end up using their weapon? Glassberg: A very, very small amount. I dont have the exact percentage, but the majority of officers—and obviously it depends on where you work, too—will generally go through their career without ever having to fire a weapon. It seems like were noticing an increase in the number of officer-involved shootings. Right now, I dont know why that is. It just seems like nationwide were seeing a lot more violence toward police. Hopkins Patch: Do you know when the last time Hopkins (had an officer-involved shooting)? Glassberg: Hopkins last officer-involved shooting was in the 1960s, and I believe it involved a burglary. I like to think a lot of it is based on our training and our tactics. We try to defuse situations when we can. However, I think a lot of that is pure luck. Hopkins Patch: Why are officers removed, temporarily, immediately after? Is that punitive? Glassberg: No, not at all. That is for two reasons. The main reason is theyve just been through a traumatically stressful incident. You dont want to keep exposing them while theyre trying to mentally heal or physically heal from what theyve been through. The other thing is because theyre part of an investigation. They need to provide statements, and they also need to get home to their family so their family knows theyre OK. Hopkins Patch: Who typically does the investigations? Glassberg: In Hennepin County, for officer-involved shootings, the majority of the time its going to be the Sheriffs Office. Statewide, out of Hennepin County, its generally the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Both of these agencies have specific units that are assigned to investigate officer-involved shootings. The investigators are very, very well briefed in handling these situations and work well with the departments and the County Attorneys Office—because eventually all the reports go before the county attorney for review to decide if theres going to be charges in this case. In a lot of cases, depending on the county, it may go to a grand jury for indictment. … A lot of counties though, just by their policies or procedures, they put it before a grand jury where the officer and witnesses testify in front of a grand jury and the jury returns a no bill (a finding of insufficient evidence for indictment) saying justifiable homicide. Hopkins Patch: And, of course, that would be a panel of citizens looking at the evidence. Glassberg: Looking at the evidence, photos, statements, experts come in and testify—that type of stuff.",0
1963,"Three men face life in prison after being found guilty by a federal jury in Bridgeport of the kidnapping, robbery and execution-style murder of Charles Teasley, 35, of West Hartford, in January 2009. Harold Cook, also known as Oink, 41, of Bloomfield, Gerund Mickens, also known as Breeze, 42, of Bloomfield, and Terrell Hunter, also known as Rell and Killer, 36, of Hartford, were each found guilty of one count of kidnapping resulting in death, one count of using a firearm during a kidnapping and causing a death, and one count of using a firearm during a Hobbs Act robbery and causing a death, authorities announced in a press release. The trial before U.S. District Judge Stefan R. Underhill began on Aug. 6 and the jury returned the guilty verdicts late Tuesday afternoon. At sentencing, each defendant faces a mandatory term of life imprisonment without parole. The matter stems from an investigation conducted by the FBIs Northern Connecticut Violent Crimes Task Force, Hartford Police Department and the Cold Case Homicide Unit of the Office of the Chief States Attorney. I thank our partners in the FBI Task Force, Hartford Police Department and Chief States Attorneys Office for their excellent investigative work in bringing to justice the men responsible for this brutal murder, U.S. States Attorney for Connecticut John H. Durham said in a statement. The citizens of Hartford and family members of victims have benefited by this collaboration and the diligent work of the Cold Case Homicide Unit of the Office of the Chief States Attorney, formerly headed by Patrick Griffin, now States Attorney for the Judicial District of New Haven. The Justice Department, through it Project Safe Neighborhoods program, is committed to reducing violent crime in our cities by prosecuting dangerous offenders. We also will continue to work with our state counterparts in their ongoing efforts to solve other cold case murders, and provide justice for victims families. According to evidence presented during the trial, on Jan. 12, 2009, Hartford Police responded to Colebrook Street in response to a 911 call concerning a dead body being found in the back seat of a vehicle parked on the street. Upon arrival, Charles Teasley was found dead in the back seat of his own vehicle, a 1999 Acura TL. He had suffered multiple gunshot wounds to his head and face, and his hands were zip-tied behind his back. Read more from the U.S. States Attorneys Office below: The investigation revealed that Cook, Mickens, Hunter and Jesus Ashanti were involved in committing armed robberies of persons they believed to be drug dealers operating in the greater Hartford area. On January 9, 2009, an individual advised Cook that he had arranged to conduct a cocaine transaction with Charles Teasley, also known as Man. The individual provided the particulars of the planned transaction to Cook so that Teasley could be kidnapped and robbed of drugs and money. After the individual met with Teasley at the approximate time and location he had provided to Cook, Cook, Mickens, Hunter and Ashanti went to the location and kidnapped Teasley by using zip-ties to bind his hands and forcing him back into the rear seat of his own vehicle. In the vehicle, they threatened Teasley at gunpoint, assaulted him and forced him to make a telephone call directing his girlfriend to bring to Cook, Mickens, Hunter and Ashanti a safe that Teasley had kept at his and his girlfriends West Hartford residence. They drove to the residence and acquired the safe. Cook, Mickens and Hunter then drove Teasley to the Colebrook Street area of Hartford, and Ashanti followed them in a separate car. On the way, Hunter and Cook shot Teasley in the head causing his death. After arriving on Colebrook Street, Cook, Mickens and Hunter left the Acura and Teasleys body, and then fled the area in the car driven by Ashanti. Cook, Mickens and Hunter have been detained since their arrests on April 4, 2017. On July 16, 2018, Ashanti, also known as Black, 42, of Hartford, pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping resulting in death, one count of using a firearm during a kidnapping and causing a death, and one count of using a firearm during a robbery and causing a death. Ashanti is currently incarcerated in Massachusetts state custody after committing a series of bank robberies since 2010. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of the agencies involved in this matter, said Chief States Attorney Kevin T. Kane. It is yet another example of how through collaboration government at all levels can accomplish much, which is particularly important in the current budget climate. The Hartford Police Department is committed to working collaboratively with our state, local, and federal partners in addressing violent crimes in our cities, Hartford Police Chief David Rosado said. This is another great example of this partnership resulting in getting our most violent offenders off the street and making our communities safer. Kane noted that the unsolved homicide of Charles Man Teasley was included in cold case playing cards sold to inmates in Connecticuts state correctional facilities. Each card in the deck features a photograph and brief details about a homicide or missing person case and lists telephone, mail and e-mail contacts that inmates can use to supply information.

1976,"OAKLAND, CA- A judge ruled today that the a strong preponderance of the evidence indicates that accused mass killer One Goh is still mentally incompetent to stand trial on seven counts of murder and other charges for a shooting rampage at Oikos University in Oakland in 2012. At the end of a hearing that spanned eight days over two weeks, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Gloria Rhynes said Goh, 47, a Korean national, suffers from schizophrenia and is unable to assist his lawyers in a rational manner. Goh is charged with seven counts of murder, three counts of premeditated attempted murder and the special circumstance allegations of committing a murder during a kidnapping and committing multiple murders for the shooting at Oikos, a Christian vocational school located near Oakland International Airport, on April 2, 2012. Addressing her comment to victims family members who were in court, Rhynes said, My decision doesnt mean this trial will never occur, it just means it wont happen yet. Im very sorry for what brought you into this courtroom. Rhynes said, Justice is not denied, its just delayed. Prosecutors say Goh had dropped out of Oikos several months before the shooting and wanted his tuition refunded and targeted an administrator who wasnt present on the day of the shooting. But criminal proceedings against him were suspended on Oct. 1, 2012, after his lawyers questioned his mental competency to stand trial. On Jan. 7, 2013, a judge ruled that he was incompetent, citing reports by two psychiatrists who examined him. He was moved to Napa State Hospital a few months later. Most doctors whove examined him have continued to say that he is incapable of understanding the proceedings against him and assisting in his defense, but a July report by Todd Schirmer, a forensic psychologist at the Napa facility, found Goh competent to stand trial so a judge recently ordered that Goh face a competency hearing. Rhynes ruling means that Goh will remain at a psychiatric treatment facility such as Napa State Hospital for now. Gohs attorney, Assistant Public Defender David Klaus, said he believes Rhynes made the right ruling but added, We dont consider this a victory for any party because of what happened to the victims and their families. Klaus also said the ruling is not what Mr. Goh wanted because he wants to get the death penalty as soon as possible since he wants to die. Klaus said he thinks that Goh will be returned to competency and stand trial at some point in the future. By Bay City News",1

Unfortunately, Grace Packer was a disposable child to these people, Bucks County District Attorney Matthew D. Weintraub said. Sullivan, 44, was arrested Saturday after telling workers at Abington Hospital-Jefferson Health that he was responsible for killing the teen. When questioned by Bucks County detectives, he revealed in detail how the girl was assaulted and killed over the course of about 18 hours, according to a probable cause affidavit. He was arraigned at 12:30 a.m. Sunday before Magisterial District Judge Michael W. Petrucci of Newtown on charges of homicide, rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, unlawful restraint, kidnapping, possessing instruments of crime, endangering the welfare of a child, abuse of corpse, simple assault, tampering with physical evidence, and corresponding conspiracy charges. Im sorry for what I did, he told reporters as he was led into the courthouse. At Weintraubs request, Petrucci denied bail for Sullivan and ordered him held at the Bucks County Correctional Facility pending a preliminary hearing Jan. 20 before Magisterial District Judge Robert C. Roth in Quakertown. Packer was arrested Saturday in Horsham Township on charges of homicide, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, possessing instruments of crime, endangering the welfare of a child, abuse of corpse, simple assault, tampering with physical evidence, and conspiracy to commit rape and each of the above crimes. Packer is scheduled to be arraigned at noon Sunday before Judge Petrucci. According to authorities, Sullivan had been hospitalized since Dec. 30, when he was found unresponsive from a prescription drug overdose at his home in Horsham in an apparent suicide attempt. Packer, 41, also was also found unresponsive the same day from a drug overdose, the result of a self-described suicide pact she had made with Sullivan, the affidavit said. Sullivan told investigators Graces death was something he and Packer plotted in late 2015. Authorities allege the killing happened on July 8, 2016. Sullivan told detectives he and Packer drove Grace from their residence in Abington to a new home in Richland Township, Bucks County. After they entered the house, Sullivan told investigators he struck Grace several times in her face, splitting her lip, authorities said. The two adults then took the teen to the third floor of the residence, where Packer watched as Sullivan raped her daughter, the Bucks County District Attorneys office said. Packer then allegedly left to buy Tylenol PM and other drugs to sedate her daughter. The adults allegedly gave her an overdose of pills, then bound and gagged her and left her to die in the hot attic. When the pair returned the next day and Grace was still alive, Sullivan strangled and suffocated her, then packed Graces body in cat litter to mask the odor and left it in the attic for three months, the District Attorneys office said. Three days after the killing, police said, Packer had filed a missing person report with Abington Township Police, saying that her daughter had disappeared and likely had run away. Authorities say Packer then allegedly withheld critical information and gave misleading statements to investigators working to find Grace, resulting in Packers arrest in November on charges of endangering the welfare of a child and obstructing the administration of law. She is awaiting trial on those charges in Montgomery County Common Pleas Court. Two weeks before Graces body was found with its arms and legs removed, Packer was captured on video buying a bow saw and two extra blades at a tractor supply store in Richland Township, the probable cause affidavit says. A forensic anthropologist who examined the saw and Graces body determined that the scarring and tool marks on her bones were made by an alternating tooth saw blade similar to that of the bow saw, authorities say. Authorities remain interested in speaking to anyone with additional information about Grace Packers disappearance and death. Any person having such information is urged to contact Bucks County detectives at 215-945-3100 or at buckscrimetips@buckscounty.org . PHOTOS: Packer and Sullivan, via Bucks County DA",1
1979,"A convicted sex offender charged with the 1975 kidnapping and murder of two Montgomery County sisters from a Wheaton mall was in court Tuesday to argue that he should not face the death penalty when his case goes to trial. Sheila Lyon, 12, and Katherine Lyon, 10, were last seen walking home from the mall in March 1975. Their bodies have never been found. Prosecutors in Montgomery County have charged Lloyd Lee Michael Welch Jr., who is locked up in a Delaware prison, with the first-degree felony murder of the girls. He is the nephew of Richard Welch Sr., who has been named a person of interest in the case, and has consistently denied any wrongdoing. Lloyd Welch was scheduled to go on trial for the sisters murders on Oct. 18 in Bedford County, Virginia, but a new trial date of April 2017 was set so his attorneys can wade through hours of interviews the suspect gave with police. Montgomery County authorities believe the girls were taken to Taylors Mountain in the rural Virginia county – where relatives of the Welches live and own land – and their bodies burned and hidden. In February 2015, investigators said they believed the girls were taken by the convicted sex offender and later sexually assaulted by his uncle, Richard Welch, according to court documents. Investigators have searched for traces of the sisters in Bedford County. The area is the one-time home for both Welch men, authorities said. Welchs attorneys argued that he shouldnt face the death penalty because it was not in effect when the girls disappeared, reports WDJB TV. A judge gave the defense more time to submit more information to argue their case before he rules. On Dec. 20, attorneys will be in court to argue over an immunity agreement Lloyd Welch had with Montgomery County investigators. The defense says that statements Welch made to police in Maryland should not be admissible during his trial. And on Jan. 24, another hearing is scheduled on whether or not Welch was given his right counsel when he asked for an attorney. At that hearing the constitutionality of the death penalty will also be argued. Investigators have repeatedly said they suspect Lloyd Welchs relatives of knowing about his actions or those of his uncle, Richard Allen Welch Sr. of Hyattsville. The elder Welch has not been charged in the case, and his daughter says that her father is innocent. Patricia Ann Welch said that several extended family members who live in the Bedford County, Virginia, area have lied to the grand jury. A conspiracy to hide the fate of the Lyon sisters was formed in 1975 when relatives at Taylors Mountain failed to report what happened, she said. Yes, he did it, I think he did it 100 percent, Patricia Ann Welch, 49, of Hyattsville, the daughter of Patricia and Richard, told WTOP and The Washington Post in July 2016 of the charge against her cousin. Lloyd has done it to other people, thats what hes in jail for. Lloyd has molested other kids. I think hes implicating my dad because hes the only one left alive. Patricia Ann Welch said there is no way her father abused the sisters; she would have been 8 years old at the time the Lyon girls were taken and told WTOP she saw nothing amiss in her family home. At least 10 detectives have spent hours talking to Lloyd Welch, along with dozens of people who are potential witnesses. His attorney said that the investigation has yielded more than 1,900 pages of transcripts from police interviews, more than 29,000 electronic files that cover wire-tap information, interview notes, audio recordings and video recordings, and an additional 1,600 PDFs that go back to 1975, reports The Washington Post. The prosecution acknowledged the vast amount of material that attorneys have to go through to prepare for trial, and the judge granted the request for a new trial date. READ ALSO: Family Members Cross InvestigatorsSeveral of Welchs family members have been prosecuted for hindering the murder investigation. Leslie Joseph Engleking Sr., 69, of Alexandria, Virginia, in February pleaded no-contest to lying to police searching for the Lyon sisters. Engleking was sentenced in June to five years in prison for lying to the grand jury, but the entire sentence was suspended in favor of supervised probation. Authorities say since his arrest for perjury, Engleking has cooperated in the investigation. Along with Engleking, two other Richard Welch family members were charged with impeding the investigation into the sisters deaths. Gladys Stangee and Amy Johnson were charged with obstruction of justice. Stangee is Richard Welchs sister, and Johnson is his granddaughter. Pursuing All Leads Prosecutors said at a July 2015 press conference that the charge filed against Lloyd Welch includes the allegation that during his abduction of the sisters with the intent to defile them, he killed the girls. John McCarthy, the states attorney from Montgomery County, has pledged to continue to pursue anyone who harmed the girls, and those who have lied and misled investigators. Life was never the same for any parent who tried to raise a child after the disappearance of these little girls. Weve never forgotten the Lyon family or the Lyon girls, McCarthy said more than a year ago. Capt. Darren Franke, head of the Major Crimes Unit of the Montgomery County Police, urged witnesses to come forward.I believe theres someone out there that knows a lot more than theyve shared so far, Franke said. If people have a lead, they can call (434) 534-9521 or email cybertip@ncmec.org. Timeline of Girls DisappearanceThe girls walked to Wheaton Plaza (now Westfield Wheaton Mall) on March 25, 1975, but never returned home, Patch previously reported. The Washington Post cited documents that say Lloyd Welch told detectives he took the girls when he left the mall the day they disappeared and that he later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the sisters at his home in Hyattsville. Police named Lloyd Welch a person of interest in connection with the kidnapping of the Lyon sisters in February 2014. Welch, who was charged with sex offenses against girls in several states, has been in a Delaware prison since 1997, according to police. Montgomery County Police said Welch was noticed paying attention to the sisters the afternoon they disappeared. His uncle was named a second person of interest in the abductions in October 2014. The elder Welch was a security guard in the Wheaton area during the time of the sisters disappearance, Patch previously reported. In an earlier letter to the Post, Lloyd Welch denied any involvement in the disappearance of the sisters.Richard Welchs daughter told the newspaper the allegations are a lie.

1980,"Gwinnett County prosecutors said Dajon Smith didnt think he could be convicted for an armed robbery of five high-schoolers who went for a late-night swim in the summer of 2013. He was wrong. Smith, 17 at the time of the incident, was found guilty of armed robbery, false imprisonment, kidnapping and aggravated assault for robbing the students in the early morning hours of July 5, 2013, the Gwinnett County District Attorneys Office said Monday in a news release. Prosecutors said as the students were walking toward the pool, they noticed they were being followed by Smith and another suspect. Once in the pool area, the teens observed the same two individuals jump over the pool fence, the DAs Office said. Smith then approached the 5 teens wearing a bandana around his face. Smith pulled a handgun on the victims and demanded money and cell phones. One of the teens escaped to get help, but Smith forced three of the students into the pool and made a fourth student go through their belongings for items to steal, the news release stated. Assistant District Attorney Matt Acuff prosecuted the case and presented evidence including a shirt that matched his description given by the victims and one of the stolen cell phones that were found in his room. The jury also heard jail calls in which the defendant states that his victims would not be able to identify him and he would be found not guilty. Dajon Smith was wrong, the DAs Office said. Smiths mother asked the judge to give her son a sentence that would allow him to finish his education. He was sentenced to 30 years, including 15 years in confinement.

1982,"Manchester Police have arrested three people this morning after a reported home invasion and kidnapping incident on Union Street this weekend, according to police. Ernesto Mateo, 28, Holly Crawford, 33, upper left, and Jada Johnson, 21, all of Manchester, were arrested on Jan. 29, 2018, on kidnapping charges. At just before 5:30 a.m. this morning, police were sent to the location for a report of a loud noise complaint inside a building, according to Lt. Brian OKeefe of the Manchester Police Department. Editors Note: This post was derived from info supplied by the Manchester Police Department. It does not indicate a conviction. This link explains the name removal request process for New Hampshires Patch police reports. A man answered the door but the officers soon realized something was amiss when they observed a distressed female inside of the apartment, OKeefe stated. The officers spoke with the 49 year-old victim and three other individuals inside of the apartment. The individuals allegedly held the woman against her will inside her own apartment the entire weekend and had reportedly physically assaulted her, OKeefe alleged. The victim was familiar with all three of them. The victim was treated and released from an area hospital. Johnson allegedly gave police a fake name which caused police to release a correction earlier today. Additional charges are expected pending the completion of the investigation. Mateo, according to reports on Patch, is no stranger to police. In September 2014, he was arrested in Amherst on a driving after suspension charge. Back in July 2016, he was arrested in Salem for reportedly stealing sunglasses at the Mall at Rockingham Park. A month later, he was arrested by Rockingham County Sheriffs on two counts of harassment and indecent exposure and lewdness charges. Last January, he was arrested by sheriffs for failure to appear at the arraignment of an original charge of interference with fire apparatus. Mateo has also been arrested in Londonderry and Salem on warrants. Johnson, according to a report out of Hillsborough County Superior Court-South, was indicted on a felony narcotics charge at 17 after an arrest in September 2014, in Merrimack.

1984,"An MS-13 gang member was sentenced to over three decades in prison for the brutal stabbing of a 15-year-old girl from Gaithersburg. Wilmer Sanchez Serrano was sentenced to 33 years in prison Friday for the death of Damaris Alexandra Reyes Rivas. He was found guilty of second-degree murder, abduction and gang participation. Serrano is one of ten MS-13 gang members charged in the death. Reyes Rivas was killed in Lake Accotink Park in Springfield, Va. on Jan. 8, 2017, prosecutors said. She was reported as a missing person in December 2017 and her body was found in February. She had previously told her mother gang members were threatening her. Reyes Rivas left her Gaithersburg home on Dec. 10, 2016 and was lured to the park, thinking she was going to smoke marijuana. Investigators believe Reyes Rivas was killed in retaliation for the gang-related murder of Christian Sosa Rivas, 21, whose body was found during January in Dumfries. Court documents show Reyes Rivas took blame for allegedly leading Sosa Rivas to his killers. SEE ALSO: The group accused her of luring Sosa Rivas to a park in Dumfries where he was slain around New Years Eve. The group wanted revenge against Reyes Rivas and questioned her about his death. Reyes Rivas was taken to another park, beaten, and then stabbed 13 times, prosecutors say. The group reportedly threatened to cut off her fingers and set her on fire before they killed her as she stood freezing in the cold. Her killers recorded her last minutes on cell phone videos. Sanchez admitted in court to stabbing the teen but said other gang members made him. During his trial, jurors and family members watched disturbing cell phone footage of Reyes Rivas being taunted and stabbed, NBC Washington reports. He purposefully impaled her with that stick over and over and over and over. This was not someone who was forced into participating, prosecutors said in closing arguments, NBC reports. Two more defendants have gone to trial and been convicted, while another awaits trial. Five suspects pleaded guilty and two others are expected to plead guilty, according to NBC.

1985,"An 11-year-old boy today recanted his story about nearly being pulled into a van as he walked home from school in Palos Verdes Estates last week. A composite sketch of the vehicles driver was developed after the boy told investigators he was headed home near Coronel Plaza and Via Margarita about 3:30 p.m. on May 28, when a 1980s-style Chevrolet van approached, according to the Palos Verdes Estates Police Department. The boy said the driver called to him and asked for directions to the promenade, and as he began to look at his cellphone to assist the suspect, the man said he could not hear the child and asked him to come closer. The boy said he was nearing the front passenger door of the van when he heard the passenger sliding door open and felt someone grab his backpack from behind and attempt to pull him into the van. He said he broke free and ran home. Given the specific details detectives were provided, the department made an immediate decision to alert the public -- the critical and necessary first step of the investigative process in a case like this, according to a police statement. Detectives interviewed the boy repeatedly and each time he consistently reported the same details in chronological order leading investigators to view his account as credible, police said. A sketch artist produced a bulletin that was widely distributed and brought in nearly 300 tips of possible suspect sightings, police said. After a thorough and thoughtful investigation, we have concluded that there was no attempted kidnapping, police said. Palos Verdes Estates police Detective Sgt. Steve Barber told City News Service the boy was re-interviewed today and basically admitted that the story was false. It was unclear what prompted the boy to concoct the story. All law enforcement agencies and the general public should disregard the bulletin, police said. Discussions were under way on possible legal consequences for the boy, but any decision probably wont be made for a little while, Barber said. City News Service",0
1986,"Prosecutors on Thursday charged a Brooklyn Park man with the kidnapping and sexual assault of a woman in Fridley on Nov. 23, according to the County Attorneys Office. Gideon Charles Arrington II, 35, was charged in Anoka County District Court with first-degree criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping. Prosecutors accuse Arrington of claiming to be a detective and forcing a woman into his vehicle in a Fridley parking lot, according to the criminal complaint. Investigators say he then threatened, handcuffed and blindfolded her—then drove her elsewhere and repeatedly sexually assaulted her. The woman said he used a bleach-type solution on her after the assaults. The charges in the complaint detail a horrific scenario for our victim, with the added fact that she was led to believe he was a law enforcement officer, a news release quoted Anoka County Attorney Tony Palumbo. Court records show that Arrington was convicted of first-degree aggravated robbery in 2009. Anoka County District Court Judge Nancy Logering set Arringtons bail at $1 million and issued an order for no contact with the victim. His next court cour appearance has been scheduled for Jan. 6. Our office will aggressively pursue this case, as we do with all our cases, to seek justice for the victim and hold the alleged perpetrator accountable, the release quoted Palumbo. The Nov. 23 assault was similar to an incident reported to the University of Minnesota Police the following day. In that case, a man with a similar description and wearing a badge approached a woman near the university. But the Star Tribune reports that Minneapolis police dont have yet any evidence connecting Arrington to that incident or another late-November incident that also happened near the university—but that theyre waiting on results from evidence thats being tested.",1

1988,"Lilburn Police Department is now releasing information on the report of an armed robbery and kidnapping that happened at a Walgreens store. According to the report, the incidents happened on Feb. 23 at the Walgreens pharmacy, located at 4235 Lawrenceville Highway in Lilburn. Police released the report on March 8. The report indicates that no arrests were made at the time of the crime, and that no injuries were reported. According to the report, the incident began about 9:50 p.m. when a victim was allegedly robbed at the Walgreens while returning four movies to the Redbox unit located outside the store. The victim told police that someone approached him from behind, and then asked him if there were any good movies to watch. The victim told the man, that yes, the movie Flight was available and a good choice. When the fourth movie returned, the victim turned around, and the man was in his path, standing close to the front driver side door. Thats when the suspect said: I need you to give me some change, and I got a knife. The victim reported that the suspect pulled a knife from his right pocket, and demanded $50. At that time, two people pulled up in a vehicle and the victim said he wanted to get their attention, but that the suspect told him not to do anything. The suspect then told the man they were going to take a trip -- to an ATM machine. The victim asked if they were going to walk over there, or take the car. I dont want to do either, and I dont want to get hurt, he recalled saying. Well, you are going to get hurt if you dont do what I say, the suspect was reported as saying. The two men then got inside the victims car, and the suspect -- not the victim -- drove to an ATM. It was too bright at a closer ATM across the street, so the pair headed for the Wells Fargo bank at 4265 Lawrenceville Highway. The victim said he sat in the back seat, next to his grandsons child car seat. When they arrived at the ATM, the victim said he told the man what buttons to press to retrieve cash. The suspect selected $200, according to the report. The suspect then got out of the car, and walked away -- possibly into the nearby Depot Package store. The victim stated he did not know what to do and therefore, he went home and told his wife what had occurred, the report states. Police were dispatched to the home of the victim, where his statement was taken. The weapon was described as having a round, wooden handle, with a silver blade of about three- to four-inches long. The victim reported that he was robbed of a total of $218, including $18 from his wallet. According to the report, police are continuing to investigate.",1

Gary Stroud, 59, of Mentor-on-the-Lake, admitted to Judge Joseph Gibson that he repeatedly struck his wife, Diane Stroud, in the head with a hammer and then hid her body in their garage for weeks. Stroud will face a mandatory punishment of 15 years to life in prison when he is sentenced Aug. 8. Stroud , two counts of kidnapping, two counts of felonious assault and one count of tampering with evidence. But, as part of his plea bargain, those charges were dismissed. Diane Stroud, , had not been seen for six weeks when police were called to their home on Nov. 27, 2011, after a family member smelled an unusual odor coming from the garage. During that time, Gary Stroud told his family and neighbors that she had left him and joined a cult, . When the family member asked about the smell, Stroud claimed that one of the chickens he kept in the back yard had died. But the family member was suspicious enough that she called police. When police searched the garage, they found Diane Strouds body. It was encased in a sleeping bag with a garbage bag pulled over her head that was secured with duct tape. Then the sleeping bag was covered with a tarp that was also held down with duct tape, according to the affidavit. Finally, both a bag of lime and a bottle of bleach were found near the body. Police immediately arrested Gary Stroud. Stroud retired from the Mentor Police Department more than six years ago. Since then, he had worked for the Lake County Sheriffs Office part time as a special deputy. He provided court security, helped deliver papers, escorted clerical employees to the bank and did other odd jobs. Stroud was laid off by the department in September 2011 -- not because he was remiss in his work but because of financial necessities, the sheriff said.

1990,"Taking a cue from an Academy Award winning movie, four billboards that have popped up in Wichita, Kansas, call attention to the lack of arrests of police officers involved in the deadly shooting of Andrew Finch, the 28-year-old father of two who was killed in a swatting hoax in December. But unlike in the fictional movie, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri that depicted the lack of arrests in a rape and murder, the real billboards in Wichita all bear the same message: Andy Finch is dead. If you believe in justice, its time to file charges. Its unclear who is responsible for the billboard ads, which feature large black letters on a red background, according to media reports. However, the website address on the billboards — JusticeForAndy.org — appears to be run by community members. The Wichita Police Department has not released the name of the officer who shot Finch late last year, saying it is against its policy. Finch was unarmed when he was shot and killed the evening of Dec. 28 after a team of officers dressed in full tactical gear responded to the fake 911 call that seemed to report a kidnapping in progress at his Wichita home. Instead, investigators have said, the call originated from California and was made as part of the Call of Duty online game in which players try to get police SWAT teams to respond to someones home. Involuntary manslaughter and other charges have been filed in California against 25-year-old Tyler Raj Barriss, who police believe placed the swatting call. But despite public pressure in Wichita, none of the police officers who responded has been charged. The shooting has increased public scrutiny of the Wichita Police Department. Finchs family filed a federal lawsuit in January that says Wichita police officers are more likely to be involved in shootings than their counterparts nationwide and should be held accountable along with the man accused of making the bogus call. In its response to the lawsuit, the city of Wichita said Finch was told to raise his hands and show his hands and was told to walk this way,  but disregarded police instructions. The response says Finch appeared to be drawing a weapon and the officer who filed the fatal shot with a rifle perceived that the male presented an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to those officers and fired one shot to protect those officers. Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett told the Wichita Eagle his office is investigating the Finch shooting. Any case involving the discharge of a firearm leading to death (whether fired by a citizen or an officer) will involve dozens of officers, detectives and crime scene investigators as well as multiple forensic analysts and experts, Bennett said. This all leads to hundreds of hours of investigation. I am reviewing it all. When the review is complete my decision will be made public. Lisa Finch, told KWCH-TV she doesnt know who paid for the billboards, but appreciates the gesture. This really matters to people. Complete strangers are willing to do stuff on behalf of my son, and to a grieving mother who lost that son, I cannot describe what that means to me, she told the TV station. It makes it just a little easier to deal with to know that so many people care about what happened to my son.

The man received a phone call Wednesday that he won $450,000 in a sweepstakes, but had to mail a Green Dot money card with $954 on it to receive the money, said Chief Benjamin Fox. The man placed the money on the card and mailed it to an address in Los Angeles, Fox said. When these scam artists think they have someone on the hook, they try for more, Fox said. The man received a phone call from a Mr. Foster who claimed to be from the Internal Revenue Service in Georgia saying that the resident won another sweepstakes, police said. The caller said the resident had to pay $40,000 in taxes to receive his alleged money, Fox said. The resident realized that it was a scam and hung up. Another Wyckoff resident received a call Thursday that his brother-in-law was being held hostage, Fox said. The man was told he had to wire $934 to an unknown address to have his brother-in-law released, police reported. The man ended the phone call and contacted his brother-in-law to confirm he was safe.  The callers prey on your sense of fear and urgency to compel you to act without fully thinking it through, Fox said. Anyone who is ever confronted with similar situations from someone who calls them on the phone should contact the police or a relative before taking any sort of financial action.",0

1999,"The jury selection process is called voir dire, Judge Richard Collins Jr. explained to the 140 potential jurors in the . It means, roughly translated from the Latin, to speak the truth, the judge said. This is all well be asking you to do. For the next several days, both the prosecutors and Thomas attorneys will ask questions of this jury pool. Their ultimate goal is to winnow the group until they have 12 jurors who will decide Thomas fate and four alternates. Collins told the jurors that the selection process could take as long as a week and a half. Voir dire is expected to take so long because of the high-profile nature of the case and, when cases receive more attention, it is more difficult to find an impartial jury. To that end, the 140 people of the jury pool filled out two questionnaires Wednesday. The first is the usual questionnaire that all potential jurors answer in criminal trials. The second questionnaire specifically asks the men and women their feelings are regarding the death penalty and what, if any, information do they already know about the Thomas case. For the next several days, the prosecuting and defense attorneys will talk to the potential jurors in groups of four to six -- asking additional questions to suss out if they should be on the jury. Then, after the extensive vetting process if finished, the court will select a jury. If the court cannot find enough people for an impartial jury, then . Thomas is McSween, 49, was found murdered Nov. 26, 2010, near on Andrews Road in Mentor-on-the-Lake. She had tended bar at Lakeway that evening and closed the bar by herself. Her body was discovered behind a nearby house, next to the bar, at 8:39 a.m. She had been beaten, strangled and repeatedly stabbed, Lake County Deputy Coroner Dr. Mark Komar said. She likely bled to death. Thomas, 28, of Perry Township, has been indicted on charges of rape, tampering with evidence, aggravated robbery, kidnapping and aggravated murder. Thomas could face the death penalty if he is convicted. Collins told the potential jurors that the total trial, including voir dire, could take 2 1/2 to three weeks. If Thomas is convicted, it could take another three to five days for the jurors to decide if the death sentence is appropriate in this case.",1
2000,"Plymouth Police are following leads on an alleged attempted child abduction that occurred about 2:40 p.m. Oct. 26, near Greenwood Elementary School in Plymouth. According to a city press release, an adult male driving a white pickup or van approached a 10-year-old female as she walked home from her school bus stop. The male rolled down the window of his truck and asked the child if she could help him find his lost dog. The child immediately ran home and the male drove off. The incident occurred in the area of 35th Avenue North and Lawndale Lane. The next day (Oct. 27) the Wayzata School District sent out an automated call to alert parents of students in the district of the incident. The press release describes the suspect as being in the age range 20 to 30 years with a dark complexion, possibly of East Indian descent. He had short black hair, a goatee and a slight accent.  The vehicle is described as a full sized white vehicle, either a pickup or van, with a ladder on its top. The vehicle did not have any writing it; however, the vehicle did have a large scratch on the rear passenger side. According to another news report, investigators have fielded a number of residents calls about seeing vehicles that fit the description given and license plate numbers with driver descriptions are being run through the police tracking system. The city press release also outlines what you can do: • Parents – use this as an opportunity to talk to you child about personal safety. Point out that the child in this case did the right thing – she ran away and is safe. • Be sure that your child knows their full name, phone number and address. • Have your child walk only the routes to and from the school/bus stop that you know and point out residences along the way that they can run to if help is needed. • Remind children to pay attention to their surroundings and not to wear headphones or be distracted by a hand –held game. • Encourage them to trust their instincts – if they feel they are being followed or something is not right, seek help immediately and to tell you. • Tell them that if a stranger approaches them, they do not have to speak to the stranger, just keep walking. They should never to accept gifts or candy from a stranger, and to be aware of luring tactics. • Like the child did in this situation, tell your child to remember details of the individual and vehicle. Parents should talk about the importance of this so that an arrest would be more likely made by the police. • Tell them that if a stranger grabs you, do everything you can to stop them from pulling you away or dragging you into his or her car. Drop to the ground, kick, bite and scream. Do whatever it takes to attract the attention of others who can help. If someone is attempting to abduct them, have then scream, This is not my dad! or This is not my mom! While sharing the above tips with your child its extremely important, the best way to teach personal safety lesson is through role-playing scenarios. Give them power through knowledge and play the WHAT IF game. And, always encourage them to ask you questions and work to alleviate their concerns.   Anyone with further information is asked to contact the Plymouth Police Department at 763-509-5160 or by calling Hennepin County Dispatch at 763-525-6210.    If you prefer to remain anonymous, you may contact the Plymouth Police Department Crime Tip Line at 763-509-5177 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 or at www.crimestoppersmn.org.",0

2002,"Police have arrested six suspects in a murder investigation in the death of 18-year-old Woodbridge High School Vikings linebacker Kenny Diaz, who was stabbed to death on Saturday at Marumsco Acre Lake Park in Woodbridge, Prince William County Police spokesperson Jonathan Perok said. Detectives from the Violent Crimes Bureau arrested Diandra Samuels, Dominic Smith, Deneen Williams, Renee Caples, Teena Gerbozy and Gregory Bonds, all of Woodbridge, on Sept. 23. During the investigation, detectives discovered that the stabbing was connected to an unreported armed robbery committed against a friend of Diaz, Perok said. This robbery reportedly happened Sept. 12 on Bellona Road in Woodbridge. The investigation into the robbery revealed that the suspect, Diandra Samuels, robbed the friend of Diaz of an undisclosed amount of U.S. currency. Upon learning of the robbery, Diaz and other acquaintances planned to confront Samuels on Sept. 21 at her address on Bellona Drive. Several of Samuels acquaintances were also reportedly at this confrontation. One of those acquaintances, Dominic Smith, assaulted one of the other parties with a handgun which was taken from one of the acquaintances who accompanied Diaz. This caused the group to disperse and flee on foot, Perok said. Diaz was not able to get away and was subsequently assaulted by Samuels before being forced into a vehicle by Samuels and other acquaintances and driven to the park where he was stabbed and killed by Samuels. Detectives identified Samuels and the five other suspects. Additional charges and arrests are forthcoming, however the main parties involved have been apprehended, Perok said. These encounters were not random and stemmed from drug dealings. As a result of the investigation, this homicide has been classified as a murder. Diandra Janae Samuels, 19, was charged with murder, aggravated malicious wounding, abduction, armed robbery, and the use of a firearm in commission of a felony. Dominic Glenn Smith, 26, was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and abduction.  Deneen Antoinette Williams, 29, was charged with abduction.

2003,"Police earlier this week arrested a 17-year-old Sudbury boy for allegedly enticing and trying to kidnap two 12-year-old boys. This was a disturbing situation, involving two young children. We are fortunate that they were able to get away and seek the help of an adult, which ultimately led to the arrest of this suspect today, Chief Nix said. I commend these boys for their bravery and our officers for quickly finding this dangerous suspect. Police received a 911 call from a Skyview Lane resident at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday reporting an attempted abduction of two boys by a suspect who fled in a vehicle. The caller told police that the suspect made statements to the boys and tried to get them to enter his vehicle. The caller gave police a good description of the suspects vehicle, which was broadcast area-wide. Officers en route to Skyview Lane came upon a vehicle matching the description given, and the officer pulled the driver over. After the investigation, the 17-year-old was arrested and charged with two counts of Enticement of a Child Under 16. Police searched the suspects car, which revealed evidence that supported the charges of enticement. The suspect was transported to the Sudbury Police Department for booking.

2004,"The Watsonville Police Department is warning the public about an ongoing virtual kidnapping scheme that a few residents have already fallen victim to. According to police, three reported virtual kidnappings have taken place this month alone in Watsonville. Police believe that the extortion scheme, which has been around for decades, is run out of prisons in Mexico. The virtual kidnapping scheme usually begins when criminals make a large amount of cold calls to random numbers from the same area code, officers said. Police said that suspects will play prerecorded audio of a womans scream in hopes the caller will respond emotionally and believe its a family member. When a specific family member is narrowed down, the suspect claims they will torture or harm the callers loved one if they dont wire them money, police said. The criminal will insist the caller stays on the phone while they wire the money in an attempt to keep them from verifying with the loved one whether they are being held captive. Officers said that once the money transfer is complete, the suspect hangs up, never to be heard from again. This is often the time the victim finds out that their loved one was never really abducted. Some of these scams have contacts in the area where the victim is located and a physical money drop is demanded, according to police. The amount demanded is usually under $2,000 because of legal restrictions for wiring money across the border. In Watsonville, two victims were on their way to transfer money when they flagged down officers and one victim did transfer the money only to find out that her family member was not in anyones custody, police said. Police said indicators one may be the victim of this scam are the following: callers going to great lengths to keep someone on the line, calls do not come from a loved ones telephone number, callers try to prevent someone from contacting that loved one, and callers demanding ransom money be wired to Mexico. Police suggest that if any of these indicators match up with a received call, people hang up, do not name any loved ones, ask to speak to the loved one specifically if a name does come up, ask questions only a loved one would know the answer to, listen carefully to the alleged loved ones voice, attempt to contact the loved one from another phone, and do not deliver any money. Anyone who suspects a real kidnapping is taking place or believes a ransom demand is a scheme should contact their local law enforcement, police said. By Bay City News Photo via Shutterstock",1
2005,"Reports of a familiar, yet scary, scam dubbed a virtual kidnapping have resurfaced in the Washington, DC, area, says the FBI and area police departments. On its Facebook page, the Prince William Police Department warns residents that the scam, which has been around for a few years, is becoming popular again with scam artists. Authorities warned that residents in neighboring counties have also been targeted, as have members of the Archdiocese of Washington, which serves Montgomery and Prince Georges counties. This is how it works: Scammers will call your cell phone and try to extort money by claiming that a family member has been taken hostage. The callers often use accomplices to convince their victims the threat is legitimate. The Washington archiocese said Tuesday that a parent with a child in an archdiocesan school was recently targeted by the virtual kidnapping scam. George Mason University warned its community last week that a student and an employee fell victim to the scam, reports WTOP.  »Subscribe to a free email newsletter: BOWIE or like us on Facebook.  The caller might try to convince a parent their daughter was kidnapped by having a girl scream for help in the background during the phone call. Another scenario tells the victim that her husband or son has been hurt in a car accident with a gang member, but the gang member will not allow medical care until he is paid for damage to his vehicle. Victims of the scam are told to stay on the phone until money is wired, often to a third party in Puerto Rico. Instructions usually require the ransom payment be made immediately and by wire transfer using Western Union. Ransom payments often range from $600 to $1,900. To avoid becoming a victim of this scam, watch out for: If you receive a phone call from someone who demands payment of a ransom for a kidnapped victim, the following should be considered: If you believe you are the victim of this scam, call the FBI at (202) 278-2000 to report it. If you believe your family member is victim of a real kidnapping, call 911 immediately.",1

2012,"By ELIZABETH MARCELLINO A man chose a Northridge home at random and kidnapped a 10-year-old girl from her bed, threatening her with a knife and then repeatedly sexually assaulting her in his car, a storage yard, a drainage tunnel and a vacant house, a prosecutor told jurors during closing arguments today. A defense attorney countered that there was no credible DNA evidence that his client, Tobias Dustin Summers, 34, was involved in any sexual assault and that the girl first told police that Summers was a man who had helped her, dropping her off at a hospital. Deputy District Attorney Laura Knight told the jury panel that Summers told his friend, Danny Martinez, were going to do some gangster (stuff), and then had Martinez drive him to the house on March 27, 2013. When Summers came out with the girl and met Martinez in the alley, he lied to his friend telling him the girl was awake and he had to take her, but would drop her off at a hospital or fire station, according to Knight. Martinez drove Summers red Pontiac Sunfire a short while and then got out of the car. Within minutes of getting (her) alone, Summers began assaulting her, Knight told the seven-woman, five-man jury panel. Summers is charged with 16 counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child, 14 counts of oral copulation/sexual penetration with a child 10 or younger, two counts of sex/sodomy with a child 10 or younger and one count each of kidnapping, kidnapping to commit another crime, first-degree burglary, forcible lewd acts upon a child, using a minor for sex acts and possession of matter depicting a minor engaging in sexual conduct. Summers is also facing allegations that he committed several of the crimes during the commission of a burglary and while using a knife. Knight walked jurors through each of the acts, stopping to remind them of the girls testimony that Summers was hurting her and began to hit her when she complained. Summers used a belt as a weapon and a restraint, using it to secure a gag in her mouth at one point, choking her with at another, Knight alleged. He hit her in the face with that belt, the prosecutor said. He likes pre-teen girls, Knight said, telling jurors that Summers used web software to try and hide his history of browsing child porn on his laptop. Summers took naked pictures of the girl and threatened her, the prosecutor said. If she tells anybody ... hell post the pictures, Knight said he threatened. The camera has not been found. Knight said Summers called his mother from jail and told her he had hidden something away that he planned to use for leverage. At one point, Summers forced the girl into the trunk of his car. She identified objects from the trunk for police, Summers phone SIM card was found at the storage yard and the girl remembered a tattoo of Superman he had on his chest. After being assaulted in an underground tunnel, the girl told Summers she was feeling sick and he offered her pills, telling her either take the medication or he can hit her to make her feel better, Knight said. Then he punched her in the face, according to the prosecutor. At the vacant house, he allegedly washed DNA evidence off the girl. At every single location, hes covering his tracks, the prosecutor said. They hear helicopters outside the house, according to Knight, who said Summers believed snipers were on the lookout for him. He ultimately drops the girl near a hospital that she fails to find and she walked to a Starbucks where police officers approached her. A small amount of DNA on her face was tested and found to be male. The defendant could not be excluded as a contributor, Knight said. DNA on her shorts was found consistent with the defendant, the prosecutor said. Summers laptop browser history shows that after the kidnapping he was searching out media stories about the girl, looking to sell his car and get a rush passport and looking into how to join the French Foreign Legion, Knight said. A friend drove him to the Mexican border and lied to police for more than a day before finding a knife in his car and turning it over, the prosecutor said. He kidnapped, he raped her, he sexually assaulted her in all these locations and he would have you believe that, somehow, he saved her life, Knight said. Defense attorney Jeff Yanuck told the jurors that when the girl first spoke to police, she told them that she was taken by a man in a hat in a black car and couldnt really see what he looked like until closer to morning when she was taken to the vacant house. Yanuck suggested it was someone else who assaulted the girl and his client who saved her. There was no sperm, no saliva or any blood of Mr. Summers anywhere, Yanuck said. Despite the police labs extensive efforts on the case, DNA tests first showed Summers DNA only on the steering wheel of his car. Later Y-STR testing -- which Yanuck called highly sensitive -- found the DNA on the shorts and face swab. The results tell us that Mr. Summers could have been there, Yanuck said, but suggested that it may have been touch DNA that rubbed off a shirt that Summers gave the girl to wear. Where is the DNA evidence that Mr. Summers sexually assaulted (her)? There is no evidence, Yanuck said. One witness got immunity for his testimony, after lying to police, Yanuck said, implying that Martinez and another friend may have assaulted the girl. Martinez, who was charged along with Summers, was convicted last October of burglary but acquitted of the girls kidnapping. He was sentenced last November to six years behind bars. One possibility is that Mr. Summers did not get to the (vacant) house until after she was brought there by someone else, Yanuck told jurors. His only intent was to get (her) to a place of safety. Yanuck also questioned how heavily jurors should rely on the testimony of a small child who suffered trauma and stress and is now being cheered on by support groups. His client took the stand although he had a right not to, Yanuck pointed out. He chose to tell you what happened, Yanuck said. Mr. Summers told you that he did not have any inappropriate touching of (the girl) and the DNA evidence supports that. His car was borrowed, his phone was charging in the charger, (Martinez) said he dropped the SIM card. The people have not proved each and every element ... beyond a reasonable doubt, the defense attorney said. Mr. Summers is not guilty of the crimes he stands accused of. Summers sat calmly throughout the closing arguments, taking notes from time to time. After his attorney finished speaking and jurors filed out of the room, Summers shrugged his shoulders at Yanuck and then smiled slightly before being led from the room. City News Service",1

2014,"PARAMUS, N.J. — Borough police helped solve a murder-for-hire and attempted kidnapping case. Christopher Thieme, 36, admitted that from December 2015 through Jan. 4, 2016, he sought help from an associate to kidnap and ultimately murder a woman he previously met through an online dating service, U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman announced. The associate told law enforcement officials about Thiemes plan and cooperated with their investigation. Authorities directed the associate to introduce Thieme to an undercover FBI agent posing as a hitman, Fishman said. Thieme explained to the agent that once the woman was kidnapped, Thieme would empty her bank accounts, fraudulently sell off her home, and use the proceeds to pay for the kidnapping and murder, the attorney said. Several North Jersey police departments and law enforcement agencies assisted with the investigation. Thieme, of Sussex County, faces a maximum of 30 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 21, Fishman said. Email: daniel.hubbard@patch.com. Sign up for Patch N.J. email newsletters here.",0
2015,"Police in Troy have cracked a case that may have exposed one of the biggest underwear theft rings in the country. Reginald Murphy, 35, of Toledo, OH, was caught red-handed with about $1,000 worth of underwear believed stolen from Victorias Secret stores at a pair of Oakland County malls that, believe it or not, lead the nation in underwear thefts, according to reports on WJBK-TV and WXYZ-TV. Murphy allegedly stole the delicates from Victorias Secret stores in the Oakland and Somerset Collection malls, two Troy malls that have reported a rash of underwear thefts in recent months. Police said they suspect Murphy may be part of a larger theft ring. Its unclear whether Murphy planned to keep the underwear for himself, give the lingerie to another person or resell the panties. Police set up an undercover sting operation at Oakland Mall last week. Surveillance video showed him stuffing about $500 worth of lingerie in a bag in about 15 seconds, police said. Murphy reportedly realized hed been caught and took off running. The undercover Troy officer followed Murphy on foot, a scuffle ensued in the parking lot and then continued in the back seat of Murphys vehicle, police said. Three other officers joined in, bashing in the driver-side window in an attempt to get inside. One of the officers deployed his stun gun, but was unsuccessful in stopping Murphy, according to reports. Murphy reportedly climbed into the front seat of his vehicle and took off, while still trying to fend off the undercover officer. The officer finally subdued Murphy and police arrested him at 14 Mile Road. Possible charges include organized retail fraud, resisting a police officer, felony assault of a police officer, and fleeing and eluding, according to reports. He may be charged with kidnapping. Police said they found thousands of dollars worth of merchandise in the rented Nissan Altima Murphy was driving. Murphy remains held at the Oakland County Jail on $500,000 bond.",0
2016,"Adams Township Police Chief Bill Westerman said today that the  was a misunderstanding and the case is solved. The boy told police that two men in a black pickup tried to coax him into their truck at about 4 p.m. Friday as he walked the familys dog in the Adams Township section of Treesdale, according to the boys mother. The boy ran to a neighbors house on Old Orchard Drive and called police. The area is just north of the Pine Township border.

The boys mother said she spoke to the police chief and the stories from the man and her son match up. Patch is not releasing the name of the mother to protect the identity of the boy. The driver of the pickup told police that he saw the boys dog go to the bathroom and he pulled over to give the boy a black plastic bag to clean up after the dog, the mother said. The mans wife, who was in the passenger seat, handed him the bag, the mother said, which matches her sons account of the passenger handing something black to the driver. The driver of the pickup told police that he said, Hey, son, how ya doin? when he pulled up, then called out where are you going? when the boy ran, according to the mother. The man is very embarrassed and knows he shouldnt have spoken to a kid. That was a bad decision on his part, the mother said. The chief said he spoke to the driver in a conference call and that no charges will be filed. The mother said police told her the man was out of town. Despite the misunderstanding, a police officer told her son he did the right thing, the mother said. Ultimately, we are grateful (the pickups driver) came forward, she said, adding that the solving of the case would put the community at ease.

2018,"In breaking news, the Middlesex County prosecutors office announced Monday it has made an arrest in the brutal rape and beating of a Highland Park woman last weekend, who had her child with her at the time. A 23-year-old Franklin Township man has been charged with beating and sexually assaulting a Highland Park woman at gunpoint. Brandon Cox, 23, of the Somerset section of Franklin Township, has been charged with 16 counts — including attempted murder — in the attack of the woman on Sunday, February 19 on Harper Avenue in Highland Park, Middlesex County Prosecutor Andrew C. Carey and Chief Stephen Rizco of the Highland Park Police Department said. It was a crime that stunned and terrified the quiet, intellectual town of Highland Park. Police said the man grabbed the woman as she was walking, showed her a gun and dragged her into the basement of a nearby apartment building, where he punched her repeatedly and then raped her. The woman was walking her child in a stroller at the time of the attack. The child, reportedly a baby, was unharmed, and the woman escaped, running to a neighbors home on Harper Avenue and pounding on the door. Her face was covered in blood. The woman was taken to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick. The attack happened in daylight, just after 5 p.m. on an unseasonably warm Sunday before the Presidents Day holiday. After the assault, Highland Park residents told Patch they were terrified to walk around town after dark, and Mayor Gayle Brill Mittler said the entire community was on edge. Several residents also remarked how seriously Middlesex County and Highland Park police took the case, knocking on local stores starting at 6 a.m. each day, asking to review their security footage and show a grainy photo of the suspect. That photo may have led to Coxs arrest: Police were showing a blurry, grainy image of a suspect taken from someones security camera, local shopkeepers told Patch. Cox has been charged with counts of kidnapping, attempted murder, aggravated assault, aggravated sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, armed robbery, burglary, unlawful possession of a weapon, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, endangering the welfare of a child and endangering an injured victim. He was arrested earlier last week on an unrelated charge. He subsequently was charged with attacking the woman. Cox was charged during an intensive investigation by Detective Sean McGraw of the Highland Park Police Department and Detective Allie Bitterman of the Middlesex County Prosecutors Office. The investigation is active and is continuing. Anyone with information is asked to call McGraw at (723) 572-3800, or Bitterman at (732) 745-4401.

2019,"- A North Aurora officer has been cleared of any wrongdoing for fatally shooting a Kane County inmate who was receiving treatment at Delnor Hospital in Geneva when he disarmed a correctional officer and took a nurse hostage in May 2017, Kane County States Attorney Joe McMahon said Thursday. The North Aurora Police Department officer, who was not identified and was acting as a member of the Kane County SWAT team when the fatal shooting occurred, fired his gun at Tyron Salters, 21, after entering a small room with other officers where the nurse was being held against her will. Prior to the shooting, authorities attempted to negotiate with Salters for hours before a plan was formulated to breach the room from both of its entrances, according to the states attorneys office news release. Breach teams of multiple SWAT officers and medics were in place when a gunshot sounded from inside the room where Salters was holding the nurse, McMahon said. Upon hearing the gunshot, members of the exterior team breached the door and observed Salters holding a handgun extended out and pointed in their direction with his right hand, while holding the nurse as a shield with his left arm around her neck and chest, according to the news release. The North Aurora officer fire three shots at Salters. The nurse was taken from the room and Salters was pronounced dead at 4:07 p.m. In reviewing the case, the Kane County States Attorneys Office determined the SWAT officers use of force was justified and that there was reasonable belief on the part of the officer that it was necessary to use force intended to cause death or great bodily harm, to prevent death or great bodily harm to the officer, nurse and other responding officers. McMahon said in the news release that there was no evidence of any criminal actions on the part of any other officer or individual involved, other than the deceased, Tywon Salters, who cannot be prosecuted. Prior to the shooting, Salters had been an inmate at the Kane County Adult Justice Center. While incarcerated, he ingested a foreign object and was transferred to Delnor Hospital for treatment. He had been recovering from surgery in a room on an inpatient floor at the hospital from May 8 to May 13. On May 13, Salters attacked and forcibly disarmed the Kane County correctional officer who was assigned to guard him, authorities said. He used that handgun to threaten a nurse and then take a second nurse hostage. Law enforcement from multiple local jurisdictions responded to the incident.",0

Detective Dave Bussenger and Officer Steve Ryan have more than 70 years of service in Horsham Township combined. Today is a bittersweet day for us here in Community Police Services, the Horsham ChATs Facebook page wrote. For today we say good bye to two of our Finest. Bussenger is going into the real estate business, while Ryan has not decided the next move in his retirement. Bussenger was also a guest speaker and instructor at the Citizens Police Academy in Horsham in April, just weeks before his retirement. At the academy Bussenger taught students about hostage negotiation situations and helped the public understand the nature of different kinds of police work. Bussengers presentation, rich in personal experience and the insight gained through years of being the #1 Negotiator, made you want to pay close attention, writes Horsham resident Mike Shortall on his blog. His most surprising tidbit was his belief that the movie Dog Day Afternoon was perhaps the best portrayal of what an actual negotiation situation is really like. Detective Bussenger confided that what drove him to be successful in his negotiations was to consider the consequences of failure … the lives affected on both sides if a subject could not be talked out peaceably. He allowed that one of the most important skills he had as a negotiator was the ability to understand what a subject was feeling and experiencing during a standoff.

Kyuseop Maeng, 50, was transported from Los Angeles to South Korea on board a commercial aircraft escorted by officers from ICE ERO. Maeng is charged with fraud in a criminal warrant issued in January 2011 by Korean authorities. Specifically, the warrant alleges that, during a one-month period beginning in November 2010, Maeng embezzled the equivalent of $3.5 million from investors in his trading company before fleeing to the U.S.  Acting on a lead provided by Korean authorities, ERO officers located Maeng at a Hacienda Heights residence June 11 and took him into custody. ICE placed Maeng in deportation proceedings and an immigration judge subsequently ordered him removed from the U.S.  Department of Homeland Security databases indicate Maeng originally entered the United States in December 2010 on a visitors visa and subsequently obtained a foreign student visa. At the time of his arrest, Maeng was out of status.  This case serves as a reminder to foreign fugitives who mistakenly believe they can elude justice by fleeing to the U.S., said David Jennings, field office director for ERO Los Angeles. ICE will continue to work closely with its foreign law enforcement counterparts to ensure that those charged with serious crimes are held accountable for their actions.  Since Oct. 1, 2009, ERO has removed more than 1,150 foreign fugitives from the United States who were sought in their native countries for serious crimes, including kidnapping, rape and murder. ERO works with the ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Office of International Operations, foreign consular offices in the United States, and Interpol to identify foreign fugitives illegally present in the United States.  Members of the public who have information about foreign fugitives are urged to contact ICE by calling the toll-free ICE tip line at 1 (866) 347-2423or internationally at 001-1802-872-6199.

2028,"- The recent arrest of two admitted members of the MS-13 gang, and the shooting earlier this month that injured two Houston police officers and killed one member of the the 52 Hoovers, also known as five-deuce Hoovas gang, is raising public awareness for an issue that has been present in Houston for many years. Long considered just an inner-city problem, criminal gangs have spread to suburban and rural areas in many regions, and that includes the Greater Houston area. Harris County Sheriffs Deputy Sam Cerda, who currently works as part of the departments auto theft task force, has a lot of experience with criminal gangs — or Clicks — as they are commonly referred to by law enforcement. A large poster in the corner of the room displayed the documented criminal gangs in the Houston area. Names many of us may have heard in the past, such as MS-13, the Crips, the Bloods, The Latin Kings, are only a small sample of the dozens that law enforcement officials know about or have encountered. In fact, there are hundreds of gangs in Houston, with membership nearing 20,000. Cerda, who shared some of his observations with the Houston Northwest Chamber of Commerce Crime Prevention Committee on March 16, wont even mention names. Im not giving them props when I talk about them, he said. I wont mention names and I wont mention their stats because I wont give them any credit. But he will share what he knows, because the gang problem has become an issue that affects the whole of the Houston area, and not just isolated pockets, or a block or two that might be claimed as turf. They might be identified by the clothing they wear, the tattoos they have on their bodies, or how they communicate, such as with hand signs. Sometimes, they will just admit to their gang affiliation by telling law enforcement officials, unless its found on social media like Instagram or SnapChat. They love taking pictures of themselves, Cerda said. Earlier this month, police charged two admitted members of the MS-13 criminal gang, with kidnapping and he murder of 15-year old Genesis Cornejo. Miguel Angel Alvarez-Flores, 22, and Diego Alexander Hernandez-Rivera, 18, also allegedly admitted to their involvement to the crimes at the time of their arrest on Feb. 27. Also Read: Houston Police Arrest Two Alleged MS-13 Gang Members For Girls Satanic Killing The killing of Genesis Cornejo was only the latest reported killing by MS-13 gang members. Last year, a 14-year old boy was found hacked to death near Addicks Dam in Katy, while another boy was found murdered in Sam Houston National Forest near Huntsville, north of Houston. In January, the Texas Department of Public Safety released an overview of gang activity in Texas that includes threats from terrorism, Mexican Cartels, Human Trafficking and gang activity. According to the report, MS-13 is gaining influence and membership, and poses the greatest criminal threat because of their relationship with Mexican Cartels. However, MS-13 is far from the only gang in town. In fact, there are more than 350 gangs in Houston and Harris County, with roughly 19,000 members, according to a KPRC report.

2032,"Two Morris County based moving companies were issued Notices of Violation for operating without licenses, Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal announced Monday. Avelar Trucking of Landing and Mundanzas of Dover were among 29 to be busted as part of a state-led undercover sting called Operation Mothers Attic in April. Each unlicensed mover was also assessed a $2,500 civil penalty. Undercover investigators from the Divisions Office of Consumer Protection pretended to be planning to move from an upscale neighborhood in Montville and hired various unlicensed moving companies advertising online for their move, according to the report. The movers drove to Montville where they were met by the OCP investigators and issued NOVs for operating without licenses. An unlicensed moving company can be a homeowners worst nightmare, said Grewal. Theyve been known to hold truckloads of property hostage until the customer pays an extortionate fee. And these unlicensed movers often dont carry adequate insurance, creating the risk that homeowners will be left high and dry if their property is seriously damaged during the move. Thats why we regulate the industry – and why we crack down on rogue operators. The public movers cited for operating without a license are: State Polices Mobile Safety Freight Unit was also at the Montville location to conduct vehicle safety inspections on their trucks. Members of the U.S. Department of Transportations Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration also checked for verification that out-of-state movers were registered with the FMCSA to engage in interstate operations. The inspections found 29 motor vehicle violations, five of them serious enough to put the vehicles out of service. Three drivers were prohibited from driving trucks away from the scene because of motor vehicle violations, including not having a valid drivers license or not having a proper license. Two people were placed under arrest for outstanding warrants, and one person was arrested for possession of under 50 grams of marijuana.

The man was told that his mother was in a car crash and that she was being held hostage until he paid for damages. The call seemed to come from his mothers actual phone, said Officer David Hartman, police spokesman. A manager in the office called police as the victim stayed on the phone pleading for his mothers life. New Haven Police called Hartford Police where the mother lives. They checked her home and found her safe along with herp ohne. Phishing scams like this, referred to as Virtual Hostage calls are the extortion version of SWATting and are thankfully not that common, Hartman said. They are, however reported from time to time. More common, are scams without the threat of violence. A similar scam was reported in Darien where a mother was told her child was taken hostage. Hartman suggests that people who suspect they are falling victim to a scam to report it to police and/or the Federal Trade commission. Any call that is accompanied by a threat of violence should be reported to police and loved ones should be checked with to confirm its a scam.",0

2037,"A Forest Hills man has been arrested on charges of sex trafficking and the rape of two underage girls, the Queens district attorney said. Peter Gerardi, 28, was arraigned before Queens Supreme Court Justice Barry Kron on a 64-count indictment charging him with kidnapping, 11 counts of rape, compelling prostitution, sex trafficking, unlawful imprisonment, assault and endangering the welfare of a child, Queens DA Richard Brown said. If convicted, the defendant faces up to 25 years to life in prison. Sex trafficking is a violent and degrading crime that will not be tolerated, the DA said. Gerardi allegedly approached the first victim, a 13-year-old girl, on the street in March 2011. Shortly afterward, he allegedly asked her to perform sexual acts with men in exchange for money and instructed her on how much to charge and to lie about her age, Brown said. It is alleged that the girl reluctantly agreed to go along with his orders, but once she wanted to stop, Gerardi became violently angry. After one attempt to flee the defendant, Gerardi allegedly found the girl and threatened to smack her around if she left him again, the DA said. He also is alleged to have had sex with the victim and had her perform oral sex on him during multiple occasions. The defendant allegedly made the girl have sex with numerous men between March and September 2011 and forced her to turn the money over to him. During this same time, Gerardi allegedly also found a 16-year-old girl on the street, whom he also forced to work as a prostitute and have sex with him. In September 2013, the 13-year-old allegedly escaped from Gerardi, who goes by the street name Prince. He is alleged to have called the girl and asked her to continue working as a prostitute.

2040,"After years of litigation, a 66-year-old doctor was convicted of stalking and trying to kidnap a Newport Beach attorney. What started with a road-rage confrontation in San Diego and ended with his arrest in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Richard Lee Austin, of also earned a misdemeanor for tampering with a vehicle for stealing a license plate at John Wayne Airport and placing it on his rental car, court records say. Austin, however, was acquitted of assault with a deadly weapon and jurors deadlocked 8-4 for guilt on an attempted murder charge that would have led to a life sentence. There were enhancements for the defendant being armed with a firearm in the commission of a felony, Orange County District Attorneys office said. (Read the full complaint against Richard Lee Austin below). On May 18, the judge will consider sentencing and set a new trial date on the attempted murder charge. According to prosecutors, Austins troubles started in October 2008 when he got into a road rage confrontation in San Diego that resulted in his arrest on charges of carjacking, robbery and vandalism. He eventually pleaded guilty to vandalism and was ordered to pay restitution to the victim, Cheryl Johns. Austin settled a civil suit with Johns for $250,000, but he later sued Farmers Insurance, alleging his insurance policy should have covered the settlement. Attorney Limor Lehavi successfully defended Farmers Insurance in the lawsuit and Austin was ordered to pay $60,000 in attorneys fees. Austin appealed and then sued Lehavi, alleging a racketeering conspiracy. Lehavi won again and Austins attorneys fees swelled to $100,000 Austin grew obsessed with Lehavi and blamed her personally, prosecutors contended in a trial brief. During one settlement conference in the civil litigation, Austin verbally accosted Lehavi and a courtroom bailiff kicked him out of the building, prosecutors said. When Lehavi got a new job at a firm in Newport Beach, Austin tracked her down and called her office a year ago, pretending to be Robert Brown, prosecutors said. He claimed to be a Chicago attorney and wanted to meet with her while he was in town. On April 4 of last year, Austin traveled to Orange County, rented a car and again tried to contact Lehavi, but without success. At one point during his calls, the defendants name appeared in the caller-ID function at Lehavis office, even though Austin was calling himself Robert Brown. A receptionist alerted Lehavi, who was so frightened she asked co- workers to walk her to her car, according to prosecutors. Austin, who had earlier been kicked out of Lehavis office because he looked suspicious wearing a wig and sunglasses, was spotted in the parking facility by the victims co-worker, prompting him to yell at Austin, prosecutors said. That led Austin, who had a gun in his medical scrubs, to dash to his rental car, jump in and put the car in reverse, forcing Lehavis co-worker to jump out of the way -- leading to the assault with a deadly weapon charge, prosecutors said. Police later arrested Austin at his home in New Mexico. He told investigators he had been to a shooting range before going to Lehavis offices because he wanted to be careful to not let the gun go off accidentally when he confronted her, prosecutors said. His goal was to take Lehavi at gunpoint to her boss office to get her fired, prosecutors said, because he wanted to hurt her like she has hurt me. Austin also blamed Lehavi for his cancer diagnosis, prosecutors said. Messages left with Austins attorney Jack Earley were not immediately returned.

2041,"Additional charges have been filed against Sara Packer, the woman charged with killing her 14-year-old adoptive daughter from Abington. Authorities say Packer cashed more than $4,000 worth of monthly adoption subsidies payments and social security benefits to be used for the teens care, the Inquirer reported. Packer and her boyfriend, Jacob Sullivan, are accused of killing her adoptive daughter, Grace, by beating, raping, poisoning and strangling her in Richland Township, Bucks County over an 18-hour period in July. Packer is charged with homicide, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, possessing instruments of crime, endangering the welfare of a child, abuse of corpse, simple assault, tampering with physical evidence, and conspiracy to commit rape and each of the above crimes.

2042,"A former San Mateo police officer charged with 22 felony counts for five alleged sexual assaults while on duty in 2013 and 2015 made his first appearance in court this week, prosecutors said. Noah Winchester, 31, could face a maximum sentence of life in prison if found guilty of all 22 counts, according to the San Mateo County District Attorneys Office. He appeared in court on Monday with attorney Michael Rains, who has represented numerous police officers in the past, such as Johannes Mehserle after the 2009 shooting of Oscar Grant, but it was unclear whether Rains will continue to represent Winchester, San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said. He will return to court on Aug. 2 to enter a plea, Wagstaffe said. Winchester remains in custody on $3.1 million bail. The charges against Winchester filed last week include kidnapping with intent to commit rape, rape, sexual penetration and oral copulation under color of authority, battery, criminal threats, and forcible sex offenses. The charges are for five victims: two in the Sacramento area in 2013 when Winchester was an officer with the Los Rios Community College Police Department, including a 17-year-old girl, and three in San Mateo County when he was a San Mateo police officer. In four cases, Winchester is alleged to have raped the women under threat of arresting or incarcerating them. In others, he is accused of sexual battery while the victims are restrained. In one case, he allegedly entered the womans home and raped her there, according to court documents. Suspicions against Winchester surfaced back in 2013 when a victim came forward to Sacramento police. Wagstaffe said Sacramento police referred the investigation to the community college district, but the victim never followed up with the report. Wagstaffes office started investigating after Burlingame police responded to reports of a distressed driver in the area of El Camino Real and Chapin Avenue at about 5:15 a.m. on Oct. 20. Burlingame police contacted a woman who reported the assault and referred the report to San Mateo police for investigation. San Mateo police Chief Susan Manheimer said as soon as that accusation surfaced she placed Winchester on leave and launched an investigation. Winchester resigned in February, but the investigation wasnt publicly disclosed until May. In the course of the investigation, Wagstaffe located two other victims in San Mateo County, one of whom was urged to come forward by the first victim, and two others in Sacramento County, including the victim who made a report to Sacramento police, Wagstaffe said. The other assaults in San Mateo County allegedly happened on Sept. 22 and Sept. 15, and the Sacramento incidents allegedly happened on Aug. 30 and July 2, 2013. Los Rios Community College District spokesman Mitchel Benson said in a statement after the charges were filed that the district was launching its own investigation into Winchesters conduct. If these allegations are proven to be true, that would be horrific for the women who were victimized, Benson said. Such criminal behavior is contrary to the core values and mission of the Los Rios Community College District, our police department and the good men and women of Los Rios who work so hard to establish relationships and partnerships of trust and service across the four Los Rios Colleges and throughout the greater Sacramento region. Asked why the college only opened an investigation last week despite the allegations being public for months, and whether the district was aware of the 2013 investigation by Sacramento police, Benson declined further comment. Winchester briefly worked for the Sacramento Police Department in 2006 and 2007, but was released before his probationary period was up. He then worked for the Los Rios Police Department from January 2009 to Jan. 16, 2015, when he left to join the San Mateo department, according to Benson. – By Bay City News Service.",0

That plea turned up no leads, so another one was issued after the storm passed. Spann had still not been found as of Sept. 18. Sarasota Police Chief Bernadette DiPino held a press conference Monday to ask people in the community to come forward with any information about the boys whereabouts. She said there are people in the community who have information about the case but are not coming forward or are refusing to come forward. We are not ruling out anything, she said of the missing teen. DiPino said an Amber Alert has not been issued for the teen because there are no indications that he was abducted or that he is in danger. She said her department had conducted searches, including a wooded area where the last pings of his phone were located. Police did an extensive search of the area by air and with dogs, but found nothing. Her department also conducted a reverse 911 call to residents in the north Sarasota community to obtain information. DiPino said police had discovered social media posts from a second cellphone belonging to the teen, but he had given the phone to a friend. Our police department will not stop searching for Jabez until we find him, she said. We want to bring him home safely.

2049,"Stephen Paddock armed himself with 23 weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition in his hotel room and had several pounds of ammonium nitrate — a compound used in bomb-making, including the one in the deadly 1995 Oklahoma City bombing — in his car, police in Las Vegas said Monday, a day after the 64-year-old Mesquite, Nevada, resident opened fire on an outdoor music festival from his perch on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. In addition, police report 19 firearms, explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition were recovered from Paddocks home. Paddocks reputation as a regular guy was upended in the hours since the massacre, which left at least 59 dead and more than 515 wounded and has been called the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. Police are still searching for a motive, but what is known about Paddock is that he was a high-stakes professional gambler and real estate investor, a licensed pilot who owned a couple of airplanes and a devoted son who bought his elderly mother a walker when he learned she needed one. Watch: Gunman Had 23 Firearms At Hotel, 19 More At Home Paddock was found dead in his 32nd-floor hotel room at the Mandalay Bay after police used explosives to break open the door. He committed suicide before officers arrived, police said. He is not believed to be affiliated with any foreign terrorist groups. Right now, we believe its a sole actor, a lone-wolf-type actor, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said. (For updates on the shooting and daily news from Las Vegas, sign up for the Patch morning newsletter and breaking news alerts.) Watch: Gunmans Retirement Community Stunned By Carnage One of the most interesting facts to emerge in the hours since the shooting is that Paddock, who has no known criminal record, is the son of a psychopathic bank robber who was once on the FBIs most-wanted list, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Benjamin Hoskins Paddock was serving a 20-year sentence for a string of bank robberies in 1968, when he escaped from the Federal Correctional Institution at La Tuna, Texas. Known to his associates as Chromedome, Old Baldy and Big Daddy, the convicted bank robber had been diagnosed as a psychopathic who used firearms in the commission of his crimes, according to an FBI wanted poster, New York magazine reported. The elder Paddock was captured in 1978 in Oregon, where he was running a bingo parlor Paddock was 7 — the oldest of four children — when his father was arrested for the robberies, and a neighbor took him swimming while FBI agents combed through the familys home. Were trying to keep Steve from knowing his father is held as a bank robber, Eva Price told the Tuscon Citizen at the time, the AP reported. I hardly know the family, but Steve is a nice boy. Its a terrible thing. Paddock owned 27 residences in the California, Nevada and Texas, NBC News reported, citing public records. In 2013, he bought a new house in Viera, Florida, north of Melbourne. He sold it two years later for $235,000, according to property records. Don Judy, a neighbor in the gated retirement community where Paddock lived in Florida, described him as a real nice guy, the AP reported. He was just so ordinary ... theres nothing to profile this guy by, Judy said. To escape Floridas humidity and because he liked to gamble, Paddock moved to Nevada two years ago, the Orlando Sentinel reported. He bought his one-story, three-bedroom home in the Mesquite subdivision for $369,000 in 2015, property records show. The house is located on the 1300 block of Babbling Brook Court in an upscale retirement community called Sun City in Mesquite, located 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The retirement community is nestled around the award-winning Conestoga Golf Club, an 18-hole championship course designed by Gary Panks that features rough-hewn terrain, flashy bunkers and mountain panoramas. The community also has indoor and outdoor swimming pools and a recreation center. Children are not allowed at Sun City Mesquite, which is limited to adults 55 and older. The Latest: Las Vegas Mass Shooting A licensed pilot, Paddock owned two planes and obtained three-day, nonresident fishing licenses from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in both 2009 and 2010. Eric Paddock told The Washington Post his brother didnt hunt and rarely fired his gun. Paddock had been married and divorced twice. One of his ex-wives, who lives in southern California, told police she and Paddock divorced 27 years ago and they had not been in contact for many years. He did not have any children. Paddock lived with Marilou Danley, 62, at his Mesquite residence. She was out of the country at the time of the massacre. She has been described as a kind woman who sometimes sent Paddocks elderly mother cookies. Paddock made several gambling transactions in the tens of thousands of dollars recently, but it was not immediately clear if he won or lost the money, NBC reported. His brother, Eric Paddock, of Orlando, Florida, told the FBI that his communications with Paddock did not indicate he had accumulated large gambling debts or was in financial trouble. I have absolutely no information he lost a bunch of money, the brother told the FBI, according to The Washington Post. The casino would know that.  Eric Paddock told the AP he last talked to his brother about six months ago, but the two had communicated via text message. In one, he asked how family members in Florida had fared during Hurricane Irma. He had recently sent the brothers 90-year-old mother, who lives in Florida, a walker. Another text included a photo that showed a picture that he won $40,000 on a slot machine. But thats the way he played. Paddock had worked as an accountant, his brother told The Washington Post, but was also a multi-million-dollar real estate investor, his brother said. The gunman had worked for the defense giant Lockheed Martin for about three years. Stephen Paddock worked for a predecessor company of Lockheed Martin from 1985 until 1988, the company said in a statement. Were cooperating with authorities to answer questions they may have about Mr. Paddock and his time with the company. Las Vegas Shooters Brother: No Logic To Explain The Shooting Eric Paddock described his brother as a guy who had money and went on cruises and gambled. Stephen Paddock was disinterested in politics and religion, his brother told reporters. Public records dont indicate any financial problems, and even if he had been in debt, the Paddock family could have bailed him out, Eric Paddock said. He had substantial wealth. Hed tell me when hed win. Hed grouse when hed lost. He never said hed lost four million dollars or something. I think he would have told me, Eric Paddock said. Last week, he wired $100,000 to his girlfriends home in the Philippines, NBC News reported, quoting multiple senior law enforcement officials. But whether the money went directly to Danley, to her relatives or for some other purpose is unclear. Danley is due back in the United States Wednesday, and authorities are hopeful she can answer some of their questions about Paddocks motivation. Authorities are baffled. Clint Van Zandt, a former FBI hostage negotiator and supervisor in the bureaus behavioral science unit, said Paddock is much older than the typical shooter and was not known to be suffering from mental illness. My challenge is, I dont see any of the classic indicators, so far, that would suggest, OK, hes on the road either to suicide or homicide or both, Van Zandt said. On Thursday, Sept. 28 Paddock checked in to the Mandalay Bay, police say. It appears he opened fire on the 22,000 fans attending the Route 91 Harvest Country Music Festival from his hotel room window. Police said they found at least 17 weapons in his hotel room, some of them apparently purchased from Guns and Guitars Inc. in Mesquite. The owner of the gun store issued a statement saying Paddock had passed required background checks and that he never gave any indication or reason to believe he was unstable or unfit at any time. Paddock was known to local law enforcement agencies, but officials had no derogatory information about him, CNN reported. Mesquite police said they had no previous contact with Paddock, The New York Times reported. Mesquite police spokesman Quinn Averett said a search of Paddocks home turned up weapons and ammunition, but he didnt give details. Whats unique for us is the gunman, the shooter, and the person with him, we in the Mesquite Police Department have not had any contact with these people in the past. We havent had any traffic stops, any law enforcement contact, no arrests or nothing, Averett said. Family members are at a loss to explain what happened. Eric Paddock told the Orlando Sentinel family members are completely dumbfounded by the attack. We cant understand what happened, he said. Nicole Paddock told WKMG-TV that she was shocked and disturbed to learn her uncle had been named as the shooter. FBI Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse said at a news conference Monday the Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the shooting without providing evidence. Newsweek had reported that Jihadoscope, a cyber-monitoring company that watches jihadi activity, said the Islamic State took responsibility for the shooting in a statement, translated from Arabic: Attacker of the #Las_Vegas shooting is a soldier of the Islamic State and carried out the operation in response to targeting coalition communities.

2051,"A man who broke into a Fremont home in 2014 and sexually assaulted a mother and her adult daughter before robbing them was sentenced to 21 years in state prison, police said Thursday. Fremont resident Jamala Morris, 36, had originally been charged with several felony crimes, including robbery, sexual assault, kidnapping and personal use of a firearm during the commission of the crime, according to police. In May, Morris pleaded no contest to sexual penetration against the victims will by means of force or violence and was found to have personally used a firearm during the commission of a crime, police said. The offenses, coupled with prior felony convictions, led to Morris 21-year sentence. On Aug. 3, 2014, Morris broke into a home in the 41200 block of Paseo Padre Parkway, armed with a short-barreled shotgun and wearing a mask. When a mother and her adult daughter returned to their home, the daughter encountered Morris hiding in a bedroom, according to police. Morris assaulted her and used duct tape to bind her hands behind her back and cover her mouth, police said. Her mother heard her struggling and came into the room, and Morris allegedly threatened the mother with the shotgun and bound her as well. The suspect took the mother to a different room, sexually assaulted her and demanded money, according to police. Morris allegedly took off running when a man who also lives there came home. Investigators concluded Morris was a suspect in the case based on physical evidence, witness statements, video surveillance and phone evidence. Police located him and arrested him later that morning, police said. After Morris was arrested, police said they found the mothers wallet in his house as well as a short-barreled shotgun, duct tape, and the clothing worn during the assault. Police said he did not know the victims but had seen them before in passing. Morris was booked into Fremont Jail on suspicion of kidnapping to commit rape and robbery, assault with intent to commit rape, armed robbery, burglary with intent to commit rape and being a felon in possession of a firearm, according to police.

2052,"A father and two sons known in Huntington Beach for ties to surfing and a fourth man were accused today of participating in a conspiracy to kill a woman, Huntington Beach police said. So far, Joseph Jordan Taylor, 29, of Huntington Beach, has been charged in the alleged conspiracy. Taylor, who was being held in lieu of $1 million bail, was charged with solicitation to commit murder and attempted murder. He also faces a sentencing enhancement for premeditation and deliberation. Taylor was caught up in an undercover sting set up by Huntington Beach police acting as hitmen, according to the Orange County District Attorneys Office. Taylor also has five prior strike convictions for kidnapping and carjacking in 2009, DUI causing injury and hit and run with great bodily injury in 2007, and making criminal threats in 2007, prosecutors said. John Reid Taylor, 67, of Huntington Beach, was part of the 2011 Surfing Walk of Fame inductees as one of the legendary Hole in the Wall Gang surfers, a group of amateurs who got the nickname for favoring a part of the beach where there was a large drain pipe in a retaining wall. He was arrested along with his sons Matthew Austin Taylor, 27, of Long Beach, and Joseph Taylor, police said. They were booked on suspicion of solicitation to commit murder, as was Travis James Sprague, 36, of Long Beach, Huntington Beach police Officer Jennifer Marlatt said. The youngest brother was additionally booked on suspicion of obstructing or resisting a peace officer and failing to provide a DNA sample as required by law, Marlatt said. Prosecutors declined to file charges so far on the other three men, Marlatt said. The investigation, however, is ongoing, she added. Investigators were not releasing much information about the case, according to Marlatt, who said the FBI tipped Huntington Beach police about the alleged conspiracy. Investigators working undercover met with one of the suspects to set a price to have a woman they knew well killed, Marlatt alleged. Joseph Taylor was arrested soon after he handed money over to the undercover officers, prosecutors allege. The Taylors all listed occupations in the surf industry: Matthew Taylor as a surfboard representative, Joseph Taylor as a board shaper and their father as a surfboard maker, according to Orange County Jail records. Spragues listed occupation was diesel mechanic. Matthew Taylor was arrested Tuesday night in Long Beach, his brother was arrested Tuesday afternoon in Westminster and their father was taken into custody that night in Huntington Beach. Sprague was arrested Wednesday afternoon in Huntington Beach, Marlatt said. John Taylor grew up in the Balboa Peninsula and Long Beach area, according to the Surfing Walk of Fame. He made his first balsa wood surfboard when he was in the eighth grade, according to his biography in the Walk of Fame in 2011. For 15 straight years he won first place in Western Surfing Association and the U.S. Championships, according to the Walk of Fame. He was on the Wild World of Sports for three straight years, winning fourth, third, and second, according to his Wall of Fame induction. City News Service",0

2055,"Two Virginia Tech students and Maryland natives are facing charges in connection with abduction and death of a missing Blacksburg girl. The four-day search for missing 13-year-old Nicole Madison Lovell came to an end around 4 p.m. Saturday when Virginia State Police found her remains just inside Surry County in North Carolina, police in Blacksburg said in a news release. This is a sad day for the Blacksburg community. As a parent, I know that this is an unbearable loss for the Lovell family. And as the Mayor, while I know that Blacksburg is a safe community, on occasion the Town and the Virginia Tech community have suffered inexplicable tragedies such as this, Blacksburg mayor Ron Rordam said in a statement. Lovell went missing Jan. 27 between the hours of midnight and 7 a.m. from her home in Blacksburg. She took prescription medication daily from a liver transplant and was believed to be without it, police said. Lovells family found a dresser pressed up against her bedroom door and believes she climbed out a window, the Roanoke Times reported. David E. Eisenhauer, 18, of Columbia was arrested Saturday morning in connection with Lovells disappearance at his on-campus home and charged with one felony count of abduction. After Lovells remains were found, Eisenhauer was further charged with first-degree murder. On Sunday, Blacksburg police announced the arrest of Natalie M. Keepers, 19, of Laurel. Keepers is charged with improper disposal of a body and accessory after the fact in the commission of a felony. Keepers is a sophomore and general engineering student at the university. Police said Eisenhauer and Lovell knew each other prior to her disappearance and he used the relationship to his advantage by adbucting and then killing the 13-year-old. Keepers helped Eisenhauer dispose of the body, police said. Both Eisenhauer and Keepers are being held without bond at the Montgomery County Jail in Virginia. This has been an extremely fast investigation within the past 12 hours,  Blacksburg police chief Anthony Wilson said in a statement. And we still have a great deal to do as there are multiple interviews to conduct and evidence to be collected and analyzed as we reconstruct the timeline of events leading up to Nicoles tragic death. Police said Eisenhauer did not admit to involvement in Lovells death and authorities found her remains through a series of tips, the Roanoke Times reported. Eisenhauer attended Wilde Lake High School and was a star track athlete. In 2015, he was named the Howard County boys indoor track athlete of the year. He was listed as a long distance runner on Virginia Techs track and field team until his bio was removed following his arrest. Virginia Tech issued the following statement on the case: Blacksburg Police have announced the arrest of a Virginia Tech student in connection to the case of missing Blacksburg resident Nicole Madison Lovell. The student arrested is David Eisenhauer of Columbia, Maryland, a freshman majoring in engineering. In the case of a felony arrest, the university has the authority to place a student on immediate interim suspension. The entire Virginia Tech community extends its support to Nicoles family and friends. The university is also reaching out to our campus community and the greater New River Valley community who may be affected by the events that have occurred over the several days. Blacksburg Police continues to lead this ongoing investigation and the university will assist law enforcement agencies working the case in any way it can. The Virginia Tech Police Department has been actively involved in the search and investigation, and over the past 36 hours, hundreds of students in the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets as well as students and researchers conducting autonomous aircraft (or drone) research have assisted in the search. Those with information or questions related to this case should contact to Lt. Mike Albert of the Blacksburg Police Department at 540-961-1150. The investigation remains active and anyone with information is asked to contact Blacksburg police at 540-961-1150. The office of the medical examiner in Roanoke will conduct an autopsy.

2056,"The remains of Jacob Wetterling, who disappeared 27 years ago in his hometown of St. Joseph, Minnesota, have been found. The Stearns County Sheriffs Office confirmed that Wetterlings remains have been located. The Star Tribune reported that Wetterlings remains were found in Paynesville, a town with close to 2,500 residents about 85 miles northwest of Minneapolis. The remains were recovered in the tree line of an organic farm off Stearns County Road 85. Robert Meyer, who lives near the farm, said he was shocked by the news. He said its strange that for so many years, people passed by the farm without realizing what was buried there. Twenty-seven years and hes been right there the whole time, Meyer added. Authorities confirmed the news hours after Patty Wetterling, Jacobs mother, began telling media that her sons remains were found. All I can confirm is that Jacob has been found and our hearts are broken, she told KARE 11 Saturday morning. The Jacob Wetterling Resource Center released a statement on its Facebook page about the discovery: We are in deep grief. We didnt want Jacobs story to end this way. In this moment of pain and shock, we go back to the beginning. The Wetterlings had a choice to walk into bitterness and anger or to walk into a light of what could be, a light of hope. Their choice changed the world. According to KSTP, a man suspected in Wetterlings disappearance, Danny Heinrich, provided information that led to authorities to recovering the boys remains. The KSTP sources say the remains were found in an undisclosed location somewhere in central Minnesota. WCCO reported the FBI took Heinrich out of jail at least twice this week. In the last few days, authorities pressed Heinrich for information on the case. Henrich, 52, from Annandale, was named a person of interest in the Wetterling case last year. In October 2015, Heinrich was arrested and charged with five counts of possessing and receiving child pornography. U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger said the charges resulted from a long-term child exploitation investigation. Wetterling was 11 when he was abducted on Oct. 22, 1989. Wetterlings friend and his younger brother say the three were biking when a masked gunman approached and told them to lay down. The other two boys were then told to run away. Wetterling hadnt been seen since. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton issued the following statement: Authorities are currently in the process of reviewing and evaluating new evidence in the Wetterling investigation and expect to release more information early next week.

2058,"An 18-year-old former El Camino College student wounded in an officer-involved shooting on the campus was carrying a pellet gun and had penned a suicide note, the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department announced today. The Airsoft pellet gun that Peyton A. Dingman was carrying on Thursday was completely wrapped in black electrical tape, apparently to make it look like a real firearm, said Deputy Ryan Rouzan of the Sheriffs Information Bureau. Subscribe to News Alerts and a Daily Email Newsletter for Hermosa Beach Patch Two campus police officers shot Dingman after he allegedly pointed the gun at them when they arrived at a parking garage on the west side of the campus to investigate what turned out to be a false report that he was holding a female hostage, authorities said. Dingman, who was shot in the upper body, underwent surgery and was listed today in critical condition, according to the sheriffs department. He is expected to survive and face criminal charges. No officers were injured. A suicide note was found at Dingmans home, Rouzan said. Dingman, who attended the college last summer, called 911 from his cell phone shortly after 11 a.m. Thursday. In the call, which was routed through Hawthorne police to the El Camino College campus police, he said he had a gun and was holding a female hostage at the parking structure, Rouzan said. When officers responded and encountered Dingman, the young man produced what appeared to be a gun and pointed it at the officers, who fired their duty weapons, the deputy said.

2060,"A tattoo-faced Crest Hill man was convicted of possessing child pornography but beat a stiffer charge that could have put him away for as long as 30 years. As it stands after the verdict handed down Friday by Will County Judge Sarah Jones, 28-year-old Andrew Castro can get off with a sentence of probation. Judge Jones found Castro not guilty of disseminating child pornography, a class X felony. Castro and his brother, Levi Castro, 30, were arrested after the cops raided the Theodore Street home where they lived with their parents in December 2014. After they were taken into custody, the Castro brothers allegedly confided to the cops that they batted around the idea of abducting a young girl but were arrested before actually doing anything about it. An investigator with the Will County States Attorneys High Technology Crimes Unit testified about the scheme during the Castros bond hearing last year, an official said. The investigator told how the Castro brothers discussed possibly kidnapping a child, a baby, sexually assaulting the baby and then killing, or disposing of the baby, and if the mother of the child got in the way, killing the mother, the official said. Levi Castro scored a sentence of probation after pleading guilty in April to possessing child pornography. As part of his plea deal, he had to testify against his little brother. During his testimony, Levi Castro said he did not actually possess any child pornography, but instead merely caught a fleeting glimpse while his little brother was watching it on a computer in the bedroom they shared. Not even a second, Levi Castro said of the amount of child pornography he saw. That half second or so of child pornography was enough to put Levi Castro on the states sex offender registry for the rest of his life.",0
2061,"A convicted sex offender pressed a 12-year-old girl to get into his car, flashing a wad of cash at her and cruised next to her on a Temecula street until a law enforcement officer stopped the harassment, a prosecutor said Wednesday, but the 70-year-old defendant countered that he was the victim of numerous false statements by authorities and had perfectly innocent intentions in speaking with the child. This young girl told the defendant no over and over again when he asked to give her a ride, Riverside County Deputy District Attorney Ed Jensen told jurors in his opening statement regarding the alleged actions of Robert Francis Baker. Yet, Mr. Baker continued to roll alongside her, refusing to take no for an answer. Jensen alleged that on the afternoon of last Aug. 12, Baker spotted the girl on Pauba Road, approaching Linfield Way, and pulled next to her, initially asking if she could give him directions to a dental office. After the victim, identified in court documents only as J.M., told the ex-con that she couldnt help him, he began tailing her, according to the prosecutor. This young girl knew not to talk to strangers, Jensen said. Shes very outspoken, and she was not afraid to tell Mr. Baker that she didnt want a ride. Jensen alleged that Baker pulled out a large roll of cash and flashed it at J.M., but she ignored him. A District Attorneys Office investigator, Ron McGowan, was in the area on business and witnessed the alleged interaction between the girl and Baker, the prosecutor said. Jensen said the investigator asked J.M. whether she knew Baker, and when she said no, Ron intervened and detained the defendant. Sheriffs deputies were summoned and initiated an investigation, during which they found multiple vibrators, condoms and lubricants in Bakers rented vehicle, according to Jensen. He also alleged that a search of the defendants Hemet home resulted in the seizure of several laptop computers loaded with child pornography. The prosecutor briefly recounted Bakers past criminal history, noting that he had repeatedly sexually assaulted a girl who had been left under his supervision in the early 1990s. The victim, then between 10 and 12 years old, was horribly molested, Jensen said. Baker was convicted in 1993 of multiple counts of lewd acts on a minor, for which he served time in state prison. In the present case, the former tour boat captain is charged with attempted kidnapping to commit rape, attempted lewd acts on a child, annoyance of a child by a registered sex offender and two counts of being in possession of child porn. Baker, who is acting as his own attorney, delivered a half-hour opening statement that led to several warnings from Superior Court Judge Michael Donner, who cautioned the convicted felon to stay on point. When Baker delved into the circumstances of his convictions, Donner reminded him that were not re-litigating your prior case. The hearing- impaired defendant exclaimed more than once that he couldnt make out everything being said in court and talked over the judge during a ruling, prompting Donner to demand silence. Baker apologized. I dont think youre doing this on purpose. But its one of the challenges of representing yourself, Donner replied. Baker told jurors that on the day of the encounter with J.M., he was under stress about a dental appointment, having visited five other dentists before arranging to see the one in Temecula. According to the defendant, he had taken prescription painkillers and was disoriented. I ended up going to a dead end on this road, so I turn around, and theres this girl walking toward me, the defendant recalled. I said, Hi, Im Bobby, and Im looking for this dentists office. The girl tells me where it is. It was hot outside, and she was walking uphill, so I asked her if she wanted a ride. Baker acknowledged asking the girl more than once, even after shed declined the first time. He said that he was preparing to pull away when McGowan approached, flashed his badge and took my keys. The defendant broke down in tears several times while addressing the jury, insisting that he was being smeared by investigators telling lies, lies, lies, so many lies. Theyve made numerous false statements, he said. He insisted the vibrators were broken, and all but one of them belonged to his homebound mother. His vibrator was intended to massage my legs, Baker said. He blamed a computer repair technician for leaving porn on his laptops, saying he hadnt looked at them in months and didnt know what they contained. He said the $8,800 wad of cash in his possession was to pay the dentist, pay for his rental car and pay the mechanic who worked on his damaged Hyundai. When all the time frames fit at the end of this trial, you have to acquit, Baker said. Hes being held in lieu of $1.5 million bail at the Southwest Detention Center in Murrieta. – By PAUL J.

2063,"Suppose a fugitive had camped out in the basement of a city home, then fled into the community when he was discovered? Would you want updates about who to look for and what to do if you saw him? This scenario actually happened several weeks ago in Olivette, and it was one of the examples cited last week as Olivette city council members considered a plan to provide emergency information updates by telephone to residents. Council members heard the plan at last Tuesdays workshop meeting. The system would be modeled after one used in Maplewood, which pays a vendor named CodeRed to provide the technology. Olivette Fire Chief John Bailot said the system could be used to notify residents about cases of armed robbery, missing children, hostage situations, natural gas leaks, a chemical leak on Olive or 170 and similar emergencies. He noted that such a system would have come in handy in late 2006 and early 2007, when severe storms knocked out power and residents were looking for lots of information about power outages. In Maplewood, officials work with the same vendor and pay $5,840 annually to provide general notifications and another $3,750 for automated weather alert warnings that come from the National Weather Service. Maplewood Fire Chief Terry Merrell told Patch the city has 2,771 subscribers to the service, plus another 381 who only get notifications through email or text messages. The weather warnings are extremely targeted, Merrell said. Its all done by computer. They look at the track of the storm systems, and if severe weather is going to happen in Richmond Heights, but not in Maplewood, we dont get a notification. Olivette is considering a three-year contract with CodeRed that would cost $7,635 in the first year and $9,260 in each of last two years. Council member Jean Antoinne wanted to know if there was information about how effective these systems are. City Manager Mike McDowell told Patch that Olivette city staff would be trained to use the system an provide the updates, outside of the automated weather alerts. The city council is expected to formally vote on a contract with CodeRed at its meeting on Tuesday. Patch Regional Editor Kurt Greenbaum contributed to this report. Would you sign up for such a service if it were available in Olivette? Why or why not?",0

2065,"Lake County Assistant Prosecutor Charles Cichocki has filed a reply to murder suspect Joseph Thomas motion . The attorneys of Thomas -- -- previously asked that he stand trial somewhere besides Lake County. They wrote in a motion to Lake County Court of Common Pleas Judge Richard Collins that the extensive media coverage of the crime and Thomas arrest would make it difficult for him to find an impartial jury in Lake County. Cichocki said Thomas motion is premature. The court may transfer an action when it appears that a fair and impartial trial cannot be held in the court in which the action is pending, Cichocki said. (The law,) however, doesn not automatically require a change of venue merely because of extensive pretrial publicity. Cichocki argued that it would be impossible to tell if the jury pool was biased before the jury selection process has started. He wrote in his motion that any hearing on this matter should be delayed until an attempt is made to seat a jury. Ultimately, Collins will decide if Thomas should be tried in or out of Lake County. In the mean time, Thomas trial is scheduled to begin September 5. McSween, 49, of Mentor, was found killed Nov. 26, 2010, near on Andrews Road in Mentor-on-the-Lake.

Heres a quick rundown of who the candidates are and some of the things they said. All five are currently employed by the King County Sheriffs Department. •Michelle Bennett: Bennett is currently the Maple Valley police chief, but has strong ties to Shoreline. She attended the old Shoreline High School until it closed and graduated from Shorecrest and still has family in the area. She started her law enforcement career in Shoreline on patrol duty in 1990. She worked as a patrol sergeant, storefront sergeant, explorer sergeant and school resource officer during her time in Shoreline.

She said she believes in collaboration with community groups and community involvement. In March 2011, deputies in her department shot and killed a 19-year-old man, who wielded a machete and struck a patrol car with it. The officers tried to tase the man but it was ineffective and they shot him. The man was on record in the state police database as having made verbal threats to kill officers. Later an inquest was ordered in the case, which is typical. Thats a difficult situation, you have to be supportive of the officers, she said. Its difficult for the family. I think being a listener and being in tune with what the community wants and needs is important. Its important to hear concerns. Its a lot to balance, and theres never an easy answer.

Hes been with Sheriffs Office for 24 years. He grew up in San Jose and Los Angeles before following his mother to Tacoma his senior year of high school. The community perception (in California) was, dont look at police, dont call them, dont talk to them. There was a certain disconnect, mistrust, fear and intimidation, he told the Snoqualmie Valley Record in 2008. But I still respected them, and I still thought, What a great job, serving your community. He has a bachelors degree in society and justice from the University of Washington and was hired by the Sheriffs Office in 1988. Wills was the Sheriffs Office spokesman in the mid-1990s. He said the police need to be reponsive, communicative and timely, and above all else, we need to be transparent. He said many Shoreline officers came out of his precinct and said Shoreline has the best officers and retains the best officers. Wills, who lives in the Snoqualmie Valley, called the Shoreline chief job, an opportunity that doesnt come along often, even though its not a promotion for him, and it would be an honor to be selected. •Shawn Ledford: Ledford is a captain in the Sheriffs Office and is currently Zone Commander for the Patrol Operations Division and serves under Wills. He is the former Chief of Police for the City of Newcastle. Hes spent 23 years with the Sheriffs Office. Hes worked on patrol in Federal Way, as a training officer on the hostage negotiations team, as a sex crimes detective and major crimes detective. He said the most rewarding part of his career was his six years as chief in Newcastle. He said routine calls for us, are not routine to the general public, and its important for officers to explain the process when emotions run high for an individual. Ledford also said he would expand the point of contact for elementary and middle schools with existing officers. He is married with two boys and lives in Snohomish County. •DJ Nesel: Nesel is currently the director of King Countys 911 Communications Center, where he manages 90 employees and a $10 million budget.

He has a bachelors degree in business and finance from the University of Washington, and has used that background in various jobs with the Sheriffs Office. He called Shoreline, the crown jewel of police contract cities in King County, the largest such city, and he cut his teeth here as a deputy. The reputation is second to none, these folks (the Shoreline Police) are looking out for their citizens. He is a married parent and lives in South King County. •Brad Thompson: Thompson has been with the Sheriffs Office the longest, 34 years, and is currently assistant chief in Burien.

2067,"A Wentzville man who attempted to kidnap a girl in Wentzville Sunday was let out of jail weeks before so he could participate in a court that handles cases involving mental illness, St. Charles County Prosecutor Tim Lohmar said. Prosecutors charged Perry with choking his sister three times July 30. He told police he didnt know why he tried to strangle his sister and felt he could not control his body. He was released from jail Aug. 8, less than two weeks after the assault. Ten days later, he grabbed a girl from the porch of her home in Stone Meadows and began running with her, dropping her when the girls mother pursued him, police said. Perry told police that voices in his head drove him to kidnap the girl. Perry now is being held in St. Charles County jail in lieu of a $200,000, cash only bond. The St. Charles County prosecutor explained to Patch the circumstances surrounding Perrys release from jail after the assault in July. Lohmar said Perry had been released so he could participate in St. Charles Countys co-occurring court, which handles cases involving offenders who may suffer from mental illness or psychiatric disease along with a co-occurring substance abuse disorder. Medicaid pays for that treatment for the state, Lohmar said. They wont pay for somebody until theyre out of custody. Keeping him in jail would have been our preference, but its not always possible in every case. Perry was eligible for the co-occurring court because the third-degree domestic assault is a misdemeanor, and is not classified violent, Lohmar said. The facts indicated this guy might suffer from psychiatric disease or mental illness. His crime (the assault) was not classified as violent statutorily, Lohmar said. A felony weapons charge or a sexual assault would disqualify an offender from the co-occurring court, Lohmar said. Not everyone who suffers from mental illness can be tried in the co-occurring court, he pointed out. Thats the hole in the system, Lohmar said. In a perfect world, with unlimited funding, you could keep these folks in jail, have them evaluated and receive treatment. In Perrys kidnapping case, he still may be evaluated. Perry or his attorney, the court or prosecutors can request a psychological evaluation, Lohmar said.",0

2072,"Lowell Max Ambler, 46, the former LaSalle County sheriffs deputy accused of violating his bail bond in a Lee County home invasion and aggravated kidnapping case, is now charged with several felonies in connection with a manhunt and carjacking in Plainfield last week. Ambler, who surrendered Thursday in Earlville, about an hour west of Plainfield in LaSalle County, is now charged with armed robbery, aggravated robbery/indicating he was armed with a firearm and possession of a stolen vehicle. The former deputy, accused of holding a teenage girl against her will and duct-taping her head and hands before dumping her, unconscious, in a bean field in Lee County, allegedly went on the run last week after violating an order of protection — and his bond — on Sunday, authorities have said. On Tuesday, Plainfield North High School was on lockdown as local police spent hours searching for Ambler after learning the wanted man may be in possession of a stolen semi-truck, which was found abandoned on 119th street near Normantown Road. Despite giving the all-clear at around 6 p.m. Tuesday and saying they were confident that Ambler was no longer in the area, Plainfield police on Wednesday confirmed that a suspect matching his description stole a Hyundai Santa Fe from a man at a farmhouse on 119th Street west of Van Dyke Road. The vehicle was stolen at gunpoint early Wednesday morning in the jurisdiction of the Will County Sheriffs Office. By Wednesday afternoon, the stolen Hyundai was found in a wooded area in Earlville, and someone matching Amblers description was seen running from a nearby hunting blind, according WSPY. The Earlville school district implemented a lockdown on Wednesday, and school was cancelled Thursday in Earlville and nearby Leland. Ambler, who was reportedly in contact with his father, former state trooper and Earlville Police Chief Lowell Ambler, surrendered on Thursday morning, emerging from an Earlville home with his hands up at around 8:30 a.m. (For more information on this and other neighborhood stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts.) Ambler, of the 300 block of Cherry Street in Mendota, is wanted on a $5 million warrant in Will County. Court records do not list an attorney for him. He is accused of unlawfully entering his ex-girlfriends home in Lee County on Aug. 26 while her teenage daughter was babysitting. A complaint accuses Ambler of restraining the teen girl while wearing a hood, robe or mask before pushing, dragging and choking her before throwing her in a field with her hands, head and mouth taped, according to SaukValley.com. He was arrested on Sept. 15 and bonded out three days later. An arrest warrant was issued last Monday after he allegedly violated an order of protection by contacting the teens family.

2073,"- Those experiencing an emergency in the city of Martinez may now send a text message to 911 if they are unable to make a voice call. The Martinez Police Department recently announced the addition of Text-to-9-1-1 services for its community members and anyone else who experiences an emergency while within the Martinez city limits. The service is primarily for use in specific situations when calling 911 is not an option, according to a news release. These situations may include when a speech- or hearing-impaired individual is experiencing an emergency; in the event of a crime such as a home invasion when speaking might give away the location of a person hiding, or in an abduction situation; or in a domestic violence situation where it is not safe to make a voice call. Here is how to text 911 in an emergency situation in Martinez: If the sender is out of jurisdiction or their text is not received by a dispatch center, they will receive a bounce-back message advising them to make a voice call to 911. Something to keep in mind about texting 911, according to police, is that it is not always instantaneous, meaning there may be a delay in the text being received by dispatch which could cause a delay for emergency response. Additionally, location information is not always reliable. The Martinez Police Department says the service has been tested with the four major cellular providers --AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon -- and MPD personnel have been trained on how to utilize this new system to better serve the community in times of an emergency. Citizens should note that a text data plan is required to text 911, and that it is not safe to text and drive. Image via Shutterstock",0
2074,"A 10-year-old girl in Welches fought off a suspected kidnapper last Friday, and now Clackamas County Sheriffs officials hope the community can help catch the man responsible. Clackamas County deputies were reportedly called to the intersection of East Fairway Avenue and East Welches Road around 4:30 p.m. June 22 after receiving a report that an unknown man tried to grab a little girl while she was riding her bike. The little girl was able to fight off the man with kicks and punches, after which he fled in an older, dark-colored SUV, police said. A search of the area did not turn up anyone matching the suspects description. The attempted kidnapper is described as a young man of Hispanic or Native American descent. He is about 6 feet tall with a slender build and long, dark hair braided into a ponytail. When he allegedly tried to grab the girl, the man was wearing a long-sleeved shirt and a beanie.

2075,"(The following is a release forwarded from the Sudbury Police Department.) Metro LEC is excited to announce a proactive initiative encompassing all units within the consortium. On Wednesday, July 24th beginning at 7 am in the Town of Norwood, a mock child abduction drill will occur.  Officers from the cities, towns and Sheriffs departments that are a part of the Metro LEC organization will mobilize and respond to Norwood to investigate a report of a missing child.  Upon successful completion of the drill, Metro LEC will become one of only 19 nationally certified Child Abduction Response Teams (CART) in the country and only the second northeastern state team to receive this honor (Pennsylvania was the first). As Abraham Lincoln once said, the time to sharpen the sword is not during battle.  Preparedness in law enforcement is critical in any type of incident, but never more so than in the case of a missing child. It is the key component to having a successful resolution to the case.  For that reason, this proactive drill is intended to simulate a terrifying and emotionally draining scenario for anyone involved  and make our response as real life as possible.  It will offer us the welcome opportunity to work with our state and federal law enforcement partners-as they assist in a force multiplier role -collaborating in amber alert notification, crime scene services and technological expertise.  It will ensure that every law enforcement official responding to this call out understands their function in the process, prior to a real life event occurring.   By realizing this vision, we will be able to eliminate precious time loss and allocate the necessary personnel and resources to the immediate goal at hand-locating the missing child. We are acutely aware of the toll that a real life incident of this magnitude can take on a community and its first responders.  However, no one feels the pain more intensely than the family of the innocent victim.  We owe it to our jurisdictions, our residents and most importantly, our children, to make sure that we prepare ourselves as much as possible to give them the best chance for a positive outcome. However, we cannot do that alone-the media are an essential part of the response team in the case of child abductions.  You work as our community partners- getting the information out there in rapid succession.  As you are agonizingly aware, the more time that elapses in these kinds of cases, the more leads diminish and the chances that the child will be found alive dissipates. As our valued partner, Metro LEC would formally like to invite you to cover this event from start to finish.  There will be a media pre event Q & A session from 10 am -11 am on Monday, July 22nd at the Canton Police Department (1492 Washington Street). If you are unable to attend that event, we urge you to send a representative from your organization on the day of the actual mock drill-Wednesday July 24th.   Please stage at the Shaws market across from the Norwood PD on Nahatan St., no later than 6:30 am. You will have access to film the staged abduction, conduct media conferences and follow the incident through to the final outcome.  Immediately following the conclusion of the drill, a press event to debrief the whole scenario will be held at the Norwood Police Department from 12p-2p, to include all agency representatives and major participants.",0

2079,"The following was adapted from a news release sent by the ACCPD: Every year in America, an estimated 800,000 children are reported missing, more than approximately 2,000 each day. Of that number, it is estimated that 200,000 are abducted by family members and approximately 58,000 are abducted by non-family members. Each year, it is estimated that 115 children are the victims of the most serious abductions; they are taken by non-family members and either murdered, ransomed or taken with the intent to keep. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® (NCMEC), in partnership with Athens-Clarke County Police Department will be observing National Missing Childrens Day this year by participating in the national Take 25 child safety campaign. A Safety Fair will be held on May 25, 2013, from 11am-2pm at Georgia Square Mall, 3700 Atlanta Highway, in the rear parking lot near the West Police Precinct. May 25 has been observed as National Missing Childrens Day since it was first recognized in 1983. National Missing Childrens Day serves as an annual reminder that there are thousands of children who are still missing and stresses the importance of making child protection a national priority. The Take 25 campaign is a national child safety public awareness campaign created in 2007 by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. The campaign encourages parents to take 25 minutes to talk to their children about safety and ways to prevent abduction. The campaign begins on May 1 and continues through May 25 every year in communities throughout the country. Every day we hear stories about children who escaped a would-be-abductor because someone talked to them about what they should do in that type of situation, said CEO John Ryan. Education and open communication are key to keeping children safer. Take 25 minutes and talk to your child.

2083,"A disbarred Wilmington attorney, who served time for swindling clients out of more than $1 million, begged a court official for a probation hearing so he can get out from under more than $200,000 in restitution he is supposed to pay before his probation expires on April 1. Former attorney Michael F. Germano, 53, of Wilmington, told Middlesex Clerk-Magistrate Michael Sullivan on Wednesday that he is in dire straits having lost everything since he pleaded guilty in 2014 to a scheme with his former Boston law partner Peter Lagorio to create false victims of a 2006 ink-plant explosion in Danverport and other cases, then pocketing the settlement payments. None of the actual victims of the blast were impacted by this scheme. In January of 2014, Germano pleaded guilty to a total of 17 counts of embezzlement, uttering, larceny, conspiracy, and attempted larceny. He was sentenced to one year in jail with six months to serve and the balance suspended for three years while he is on probation. He was ordered to pay restitution. The Massachusetts Bar Association used money from its victims compensation fund to repay the victims of the two lawyers, but Probation Department says Germano was ordered to repay the fund about $200,000. Some money has been paid over the years, but a large amount is still owed and cannot be repaid before Germanos probation ends. Prior to a 2016 decision by the states highest court, judges would either extend a defendants probation until restitution is paid or invoke the remainder of the jail sentence. The state Supreme Judicial Court ruled that defendants cant be held hostage by unpaid restitution. Sullivan was able to schedule a probation hearing on Thursday for a superior court judge to decide Germanos fate. Photo of Michael F.

2084,"A man allegedly linked through DNA evidence to the 2001 kidnapping and sexually assault of a 14-year-old boy in the San Fernando Valley pleaded not guilty Thursday to felony charges and was ordered held on $1 million bail. Mirek Voyt, 55, of Hollywood was arrested at his home on Tuesday, according to Los Angeles Police Department Capt. William Hayes, who announced the arrest at a news conference at downtown police headquarters. Voyt was arraigned on one count each of kidnapping to commit oral copulation by force or fear and forcible oral copulation, with an allegation that he used a handgun during the commission of the crimes, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office. Although DNA evidence was obtained at the time of the crime, a match was not made until Voyt was arrested on suspicion of grand theft late last year and his DNA was obtained and run through a state database, according to Hayes, commanding officer of the LAPDs Robbery-Homicide Division. The victim was walking to school with another boy about 9:45 a.m. on June 22, 2001, near the intersection of Chase Street and Vanalden Avenue in Northridge when a man armed with a handgun confronted them, according to Hayes. One of the boys managed to flee but the other was kidnapped, taken to an unknown location and sexually assaulted before he was released, the captain said. Voyt lived within a short distance of the intersection where the abduction occurred, and investigators allege he took the boy to his home after abducting him and blindfolding him. At the time of his arrest, Voyt was working in a management position for a grocery store chain, and since 2001 has lived in various locations in the Los Angeles area, the captain said. Hayes said investigators fear Voyt may have victimized others. Sexual assault crimes involving males often go unreported, and we want them to know we are willing to work with them and help them in any way ...., he said. He displayed photos of the suspect from 1997, 2012 and 2017, and said all investigations would be handled confidentially. When you look at a predator of this nature and the violence that occurred in 2001, although hes remained off the radar in terms of other criminal acts, one would find it hard to believe that that was the only time, Hayes said. So thats why we are trying to be cautious and go out there. Anyone with information about the suspect was urged to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS. Tips can be made anonymously.

2087,"Three men with connections to Kiryas Joel were sentenced Thursday in connection with a kidnapping and murder plot. Joon H. Kim, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said that Aharon Goldberg, Shimen Liebowitz, and Binyamin Gottlieb were sentenced today for their respective roles in devising and covering up a plot to kidnap and murder an individual in order to obtain a religious divorce for that individuals wife. Goldberg, 56, pleaded guilty on Sept. 28 to conspiring to commit kidnapping and murder for hire. Liebowitz, 26, pleaded guilty on July 27 to conspiring to commit extortion. Gottlieb, 34, pleaded guilty on Sept. 15 to helping to conceal the plot from law enforcement. U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein sentenced Goldberg to three years in prison, Liebowitz to two years in prison and Gottlieb to one years probation. In addition to their prison sentences, Goldberg of Bnei Brak, Israel, and Liebowitz of Monroe, were each sentenced to three years of supervised release. Gottlieb is from Airmont. Liebowitz is a member of the Satmar community in Kiryas Joel. Goldberg is an Israel-based rabbi who also maintains a position of prominence in Kiryas Joel. Kim said the defendants were involved in a terrifying plot to kidnap, and ultimately to kill, their intended victim. Fortunately, the person they hired to carry out their crime alerted the FBI, and now the defendants have been held accountable for their crimes, he said. According to the complaints and statements made during court proceedings and in public filings Jewish religious law as observed in certain communities, says that in order to effect a divorce, a husband must provide his wife with a document known as a get. A woman whose husband will not consent to a divorce is known as an agunah. In the absence of the husbands issuing a get, an agunah may be released from her marriage only through the husbands death. In or about July 2016, Goldberg and Liebowitz began working to orchestrate the kidnapping of an individual who refused to grant a get to his wife. The purpose of the kidnapping was to imprison and torture the him until he agreed to give his wife a get. Gottlieb, an associate of Goldberg and Liebowitz, placed them in touch with a private investigator, whom Goldberg and Liebowitz solicited to personally carry out the kidnapping and torture in exchange for payment. Unbeknownst to Goldberg and Liebowitz, however, the private investigator reported the plot to the FBI and recorded several of his meetings with the defendants. In July 2016, the private investigator met with Goldberg, in Gottliebs presence, to discuss the kidnapping plot. Although Liebowitz was not present at the beginning of the meeting, he arrived and joined the conversation after several minutes. The private investigator made an audio recording of the meeting using a hidden recording device. During the meeting and after Liebowitz arrived, the parties discussed, among other things, the logistics of the kidnapping plot, including the possibility of kidnapping the victim in the United States and holding him captive in a cage, or kidnapping him in Ukraine and transporting him to Israel. Liebowitz also provided the private investigator with details to assist the him in carrying out the kidnapping plot. During the meeting, Goldberg and Liebowitz also agreed to advance the private investigator $25,000 to assist in efforts to plan the kidnapping. Within days of this initial meeting, an envelope containing approximately $25,000 cash was delivered to the private investigator. On or about August 9, 2016, the private investigator met with Liebowitz and Goldberg in Kiryas Joel. During this meeting, the private investigator, Goldberg, and Liebowitz discussed additional details of the kidnapping plan, including logistics and the cost associated with a plan to kidnap the Intended Victim overseas. This conversation was also recorded, authorities said. On August 12, 2016, the private investigator again met with Liebowitz and Goldberg, at which time they provided him with an additional payment of more than $20,000 for use in making arrangements for the kidnapping. In this meeting, which was also recorded, the private investigator, Goldberg and Liebowitz further discussed their plan to kidnap the victim in the United States and to obtain the get from him in this country. Subsequent to the August 12, 2016, meeting, the private investigator had additional conversations with Goldberg, in which Goldberg discussed his desire not merely to kidnap the intended victim, but also to kill him. On August 25, 2016, the private investigator met Liebowitz in Central Valley. During the meeting, Liebowitz paid the private investigator an additional sum of about $12,000 to carry out the kidnapping. Also during the meeting, the private investigator spoke by phone with Goldberg, who was still in Israel, about the kidnapping plan, which the private investigator and Goldberg referred to in code as a wedding, as well as Goldbergs desire that the private investigator kill the intended victim. This conversation was also recorded. On or about Sept. 2, 2016, the private investigator had another recorded conversation with Liebowitz, during which Liebowitz indicated his understanding that the intended victim would be murdered as part of the plan. Subsequently, on Sept. 6, 2016, Liebowitz and Goldberg again met with the private investigator. During that meeting, Liebowitz and Goldberg paid the private investigator an additional $16,000. The private investigator led Liebowitz and Goldberg to believe that the private investigator had captured the intended victim, had tortured him in order to force him to provide a get, and that the he had so far refused to do so. The private investigator discussed options for what to do with the intended victim given his unwillingness to give the get. Goldberg replied by referencing his prior directive to the private investigator to kill the intended victim, saying, Ive told you whatever Ive told you, and I even got an OK from one of the rabbis. He [the intended victim] cannot slip out of your fingers. Liebowitz then interjected, Im on his side, whatever he says Im with him. Goldberg resolved that the only way forward was to put a bullet in the intended victim. Liebowitz interjected that if the man were to be killed, arrangements would have to be made to ensure that there was a witness who could verify that he was dead (and that the wife could remarry) without leading back to Liebowitz and his co-conspirators. Liebowitz later stated, Somebody is going to need to tell a rabbi that I have saw with respect to the death of the man. Goldberg and the private investigator then discussed the possibility of burying the intended victim and seeing to it that his body was exhumed and identified using DNA. Liebowitz interjected, There is no way to put him out on the street somewhere? The September 6 conversation ended with FBI agents arresting Liebowitz and Goldberg. On Sept. 11, 2016, FBI agents interviewed Gottlieb about his knowledge of the plot. At that time, Gottlieb stated that he had no knowledge of any conversation where the plot was discussed, despite the fact that he had been present at the initial meeting between the private investigator, Goldberg, and Liebowitz.

2089,"The Hopatcong man who kidnapped his own sons in early February and was found in a seedy Florida hotel Wednesday night wasnt alone, and his company was one of Tennessees most wanted fugitives. Kristopher Dohm, who took his sons Parker and Jaxon, 8 and 7, respectively, from his mothers custody in February was found with Edward William Tarras, Jr., who has been sought since August 19, 2014 by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations and was a member of the states Top Ten Most Wanted list. According to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations, a joint investigation led to information that said Tarras was with Dohm in the New Port Richey section of Florida. Dohm told his ex-wife he wanted to take his sons for a few extra days beyond their custody agreement to see an ailing relative in Nevada. The last time the boys mother, Sandy Dohm, heard from her children was Feb. 5. On Feb. 9, the children were deemed missing and Kristopher Dohm was considered the suspect. Initial police reports indicate Parker and Jaxon Dohm were safe and unharmed at the time they were found. In January of this year, Morris County CrimeStoppers issued an alert saying the search for Tarras was being traced to northern New Jersey because of his ties to the Budd Lake area. Tarras was charged in Tennessee with rape, sexual battery, 19 counts of especially aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor, and sexual exploitation of a minor more than 100 times. On Aug. 15, 2014, Tarras cut off his tracking bracelet and fled the state, Tennessee Bureau of Investigations reported. The two are currently being held without bond in Pasco County Central Detention Center in Florida.

2090,">>News Alerts: Subscribe to a free email newsletter: BETHESDA•ROCKVILLE • SILVER SPRING Investigators served a search warrant Tuesday at the Hyattsville home of a man named previously as a person of interest in the case of the Lyon sisters, two girls who have been missing for almost 40 years from Montgomery County. WUSA reports Montgomery County Police confirmed that officers served a warrant at the home of Richard Welch in the 4700 block of Baltimore Avenue in Hyattsville. A family member told WUSA that authorities were at the home for about 20 minutes and that nothing was seized from the property. No arrests were made Tuesday, the TV station says. Convicted sex offender Lloyd Lee Welch, 58, and his uncle, Richard Allen Welch Sr., 69, have been named persons of interest in the girls disappearance, say police. In February, investigators said they believed the girls were taken by the convicted sex offender and later sexually assaulted by his uncle, according to court documents. The information was contained in search warrants executed as Montgomery County Police, the FBI and sheriffs deputies searched for traces of sisters Sheila Lyon, 12, and Katherine Lyon, 10, of Wheaton on Taylors Mountain in Bedford County, VA. The area is the one-time home for both Welch men, authorities said, and two searches of the region have been done, the most recent in March. Timeline of Girls Disappearance The girls walked to Wheaton Plaza (now Westfield Wheaton Mall) on March 25, 1975, but never returned home, Patch previously reported. The Washington Post cited documents that say Lloyd Welch told detectives he took the girls when he left the mall the day they disappeared, and that he later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the sisters. Our department and our partners in Virginia remain committed to determining what happened to Katherine and Sheila Lyon, said Montgomery Police Chief J. Thomas Manger in February 2015. We believe that there are people, including family members of Dick and Lloyd Welch, who have information that would further this investigation. Police named Lloyd Welch a person of interest in connection with the kidnapping of the Lyon sisters in February 2014. Welch, who was charged with sex offenses against girls in several states, has been in a Delaware prison since 1997, according to police. Montgomery County Police said that Welch was noticed paying attention to the sisters the afternoon they disappeared. His uncle was named a second person of interest in the abductions in October 2014. The elder Welch was a security guard in the Wheaton area during the time of the sisters disappearance, Patch previously reported. Investigators believe Richard Welch owned property at Taylors Mountain in the Thaxton area of Bedford County, WJLA TV reports. Montgomery County Assistant Police Chief Russ Hamill Hamill said previously he thinks theres a good chance the girls are on the mountain. In an earlier letter to the Post, Lloyd Welch denied any involvement in the disappearance of the sisters. Richard Welchs daughter told the newspaper the allegations are a lie. Anyone with information about the case is asked to call Montgomery County Police at 240-773-5070. »Screenshot of Welch home from WUSA; photo of Lyon sisters from Montgomery Police      Earlier Patch Coverage:",1

2093,"Originally posted at 10:11 a.m. May 24, 2014. Edited with new details. An Amber alert for two missing girls was cancelled when the Riverside man suspected of kidnapping the children gave himself up in Corona early today. The suspect, Pete Valencia Adame, 43, abducted his former girlfriend and three children from Kennedy Park in Pomona at 6:05 p.m. Friday, Pomona Police Department Lt. Ron McDonald said today. At some point Adame released the ex-girlfriend and her 5-year-old son, and drove off with the girls, ages 2 and 4. Pomona police issued the Amber Alert at 10:20 p.m. Friday. It was unclear if Adame was the father of all three children and if he was involved in an alleged sexual assault of the girlfriend, which prompted police not to release her name, McDonald said. A motive behind Adames alleged role in the abduction was not immediately known, McDonald said. Adame called 911 when he learned he was the subject of the Amber Alert, and was instructed by the California Highway Patrol dispatcher to pull his vehicle over at a gas station near the Magnolia Avenue exit of the Corona (15) Freeway. CHP officers arrested Adame and called Pomona police to pick him up, McDonald said. The children were found unharmed and the Amber Alert was canceled at 1:45 a.m. today. Adame was arrested and booked into the Pomona jail for suspicion of kidnapping and rape. His bail was set at $100,000, records showed. The Amber Alert was one of two issued in the Southland Friday, and police today continued to seek a Los Angeles man and his toddler son allegedly kidnapped from the mother outside her home. The CHP issued a statewide Amber Alert Friday morning for Abraham Vargas, 27, and 2-year-old Edwin Vargas. The father allegedly has made prior threats to snatch the child and flee to Mexico with him. The suspects 2004 Nissan Quest was found abandoned in East Los Angeles, but the suspect and his son remained at large today. --City News Service",1
