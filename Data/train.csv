3,3,"An Amtrak train carrying Republican members of Congress to a party retreat crashed into a truck Wednesday in Virginia, causing minor injuries onboard, killing one passenger on the truck and injuring the driver and a second passenger, according to authorities. The White House said there were no serious injuries among members of Congress or their staff. Amtrak said two crew members and three passengers suffered minor injuries and were transported to a local hospital. Among the injured was a congressman from Minnesota who was checked out and discharged from a local hospital per standard concussion protocol. Albemarle County Police identified the truck passenger who was killed as 28-year-old Christopher Foley. A second passenger was airlifted to the hospital in critical condition while the driver of the truck was transported via road in serious condition, police said. The train crash happened west of Crozet, Virginia, about 15 miles from Charlottesville. The GOP retreat was scheduled to take place at The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. The annual event is scheduled to last three days and will feature speeches from Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Charter buses transported Republicans to the retreat. White Sulphur Springs is roughly a two-hour drive from Crozet. At a press conference Wednesday night, the National Transportation Safety Board said a multi disciplinary team of experts would investigate the crash to understand what happened and why. The NTSB said it would be making recommendations based on the results of the investigation but would not speculate on the cause of the crash before the investigation was complete. The NTSB said it did know whether the part of the track where the crash happened was equipped with positive train control or PTC but they suspected that it was not. The NTSB also said that if they were to find any information to suggest the crash was intentional, they would turn over the information to the FBI. Lawmakers on board rendered aid to the injured on the truck and one representative administered CPR on the truck driver. Sen. Jeff Flake, of Arizona, along with Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana and Rep. Brad Wenstrup, of Ohio, helped carry one truck passenger to an ambulance, The Washington Post reported. Rep. Barry Loudermilk, of Georgia, told the Post the lawmakers literally pried open the doors and jumped off the train to assist those injured. Rep. Roger Marshall, a Republican from Kansas who is also a doctor, performed CPR on the truck driver and helped two people in the truck who were transported to an ambulance, he wrote on Twitter. Other lawmakers took to Twitter to offer their condolences and say that they were ok following the crash. Rep. Jason Lewis, a Republican from Minnesota, was checked out at the hospital for signs of a concussion. In a statement, Amtrak said the train came in contact with another vehicle around 11:20 a.m. It is premature to offer specific comment about this incident, however, it is clear that accidents at rail crossings nationwide are far too common, Amtrak said in an updated statement Wednesday night. This is an opportunity to remind everyone about the importance of exercising caution around railroad rights-of-way. Amtrak continues to work closely with Operation Lifesaver to communicate the dangers of grade crossings. Each year, about 2,000 people are killed or injured in grade crossing and trespassing incidents nationwide. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, told The Washington Post that the truck looked like it had been cut in half. We can see garbage strewn around and we can see the back half of the truck, Lee told the paper. There was a feeling of an impact and you could feel we had hit something. It took us maybe a quarter mile to stop. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a Republican from Florida, said in an interview with MSNBC that there was a sudden impact, a loud noise and everyone was jolted. It was just uncomfortable for a few minutes and as we started realizing that everyone was OK I think that people started feeling better, Curbelo said. NBC News reported that House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was on board the train, was not injured. Todays incident was a terrible tragedy, Ryan said in a statement on Twitter. We are grateful for the first responders who rushed to the scene and we pray for the victims and their families. May they all be in our thoughts right now. Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement on the crash, offering condolences to the victims family, friends and coworkers. SEE ALSO: Virginia Train Crash: The Worst Amtrak Crashes In History Patch has compiled a list of GOP representatives on board the train. According to Patchs tally, over 100 GOP lawmakers were on board the train. We will update this list as we hear of more members of Congress who were on board. Just learned of the crash involving the train carrying Republican Members of Congress to their retreat today, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said on Twitter. Praying that all are well both on the train and off. The crash happened just a day after Trump delivered his first State of the Union speech, addressing a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill. Republicans were headed to the party retreat where they will focus on the upcoming midterm election, according to a schedule obtained by Politico. Republicans face a tough midterm election as Democrats riding on anti-Trump sentiment and unpopular GOP policies are aiming to take back control of at least one of the chambers of Congress. Several prominent Republicans have announced that they will not seek reelection with Rep. Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina representative who led the House Benghazi inquiry, being the latest to announce his retirement. Just seven months ago, a shooting at a GOP baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, critically injured Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise. At Tuesdays State of the Union, Scalise was honored by Trump and received a standing ovation.  Dan Hampton and Colin Miner contributed reporting. Patch will update this breaking news story.

8,8,"- A Santa Rosa couple was charged in Sonoma County Superior Court on Dec. 19 with 17 felony counts in connection with identity and credit card theft from teachers at several elementary schools in the county, including Petaluma. Jeffrey Scott Haysbert, 49, and Susan Patricia Morris, 47, are charged with six burglaries, eight counts of getting credit with another persons identity and one count each of receiving stolen property, conspiracy and multiple theft of identification information. They also are charged with misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia. Theyre scheduled to enter pleas Jan. 17. Santa Rosa police said the credit card thefts from wallets and purses happened at vacant classrooms during school hours at eight different elementary schools in Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Petaluma and unincorporated Sonoma County. Police used surveillance camera video of the fraudulent purchases with the credit cards and the thefts from the schools to identify Morris and Haysbert as the suspects, Santa Rosa police Sgt. Marcus Sprague said. When photos of the suspects were posted on social media sites, detectives immediately began receiving phone calls with possible suspect information, Sprague said. Santa Rosa police detectives got a warrant to search Morriss and Haysberts vehicles and their residence Thursday. Police found stolen credit cards and the purchases, including high-end electronics, that were made with them, Sprague said. Detectives found additional credit cards and personal information belonging to other possible victims, and Morris and Haysbert were arrested and questioned at the Santa Rosa Police Department on Dec. 15, Sprague said. Police said Morris and Haysbert had a dating relationship and have children in one of the schools they allegedly victimized. Judge Arthur Wick set bail today for each defendant at $150,000. Wick denied a request to release Morris, citing a report stating she deserves intense supervision. Both defendants were referred to TASC, a national drug assessment and case management program for controlled substance treatment. After the arraignment, Haysberts attorney Barry McBride said credit card thefts from unattended wallets and purses are normally crimes of opportunity, but the controlled substance charges suggest the alleged crimes are drug related.

23,23,"- An undercover Napa Special Investigations Bureau (NSIB) probe into the suspected cocaine trafficking activities of a Napa man ended with his arrest last week when detectives served a search warrant allowing them access to the 27-year-olds cars and home, the NSIB announced in a news release Thursday. Working off information initially developed in spring of this year that Alifonso Martinez was allegedly selling cocaine in and around Napa, NSIB detectives obtained the warrant and on Wednesday, Aug. 9, conducted surveillance on Martinez at his place of employment in the 200 block of Devlin Road, NSIB Lt. Gary Pitkin stated in the news release. Martinez was detained as detectives searched his car, inside of which they allegedly found both cocaine and crystal methamphetamine intended for sale, the lieutenant said. Detectives then searched Martinezs home in the 100 block of Garth Street, where according to Pitkin, they seized more cocaine and meth, packaging materials, a digital scale and over $7,200 in cash allegedly found in Martinezs bedroom. Pitkin said Martinez was arrested without incident and booked into Napa County Department of Corrections on suspicion of possession of both cocaine and meth for sale. Pursuant to asset forfeiture laws, NSIB seized the cash as suspected drug proceeds. The arrest and seizure prevented over 500 doses of cocaine and crystal meth from hitting the streets, Pitkin said.

31,31,"It began in Acton and Boxborough and ended in a parking lot in Framingham. Following a months-long investigation into alleged drug distribution in Acton and Boxborough, law enforcement officials from an alphabet soup of agencies on Wednesday announced the arrest of two men on multiple charges, including conspiracy to violate the states drug laws. On Tuesday, Sept. 24, Acton Patch reported the arrest of Frantz Cantave, 26, of 24 Thompson St., Hyde Park, who was charged with trafficking in more than 100 grams of heroin, trafficking in more than 18 grams of OxyContin and conspiracy. Along with the arrest of Cantave, authorities revealed Wednesday, Kevin Jean, 24, of Lynn, was also arrested and charged with possession of a Class B substance (OxyContin) with intent to distribute and conspiracy. Both men were arraigned in West Roxbury District Court on Sept. 19 and ordered to stay away from one another while the case is pending, according to a press release from the Suffolk District Attorneys office. The investigation that led to the arrests of Cantave and Jean last week began about two months ago in the suburban communities of Acton and Boxborough.  According to authorities, the Acton Police Departments Drug Unit and detectives from Boxborough began investigating drug distribution in their communities, developing enough evidence to warrant State Police detectives and DEA agents to begin surveillance on Cantave, in anticipation that he would make a significant drug delivery Sept. 18 in Framingham. From the Suffolk County DAs press release: That afternoon, they watched as Cantave and Jean exited Cantaves residence, entered a black Jeep Cherokee, and began driving. Investigators tailed the men to Staples Drive in Framingham, where State Police and DEA special agents approached them. They recovered about 100 30mg tablets of OxyContin from Cantave, 30 30mg tablets of OxyContin from Jean, and a large quantity of cash from both men. After being advised of his Miranda rights, Cantave signed a consent form allowing investigators to search his home. There, troopers and special agents recovered an additional 700 OxyContin tablets and about 180 grams of heroin, along with a powdery substance believed to be a cutting agent and more currency. The total cash seizure was $70,951. Officials from all agencies involved lauded the arrest for the success of interagency cooperation in getting dangerous drugs off of the streets. Said Acton Police Chief Francis Widmayer: These cases are excellent examples of how effective local, state and federal law enforcement agencies can be when they work together cooperatively in the common goal of eliminating drug abuse in our communities. Boxborough Chief Warren Ryder addressed the prevalence of heroin and Oxy in these suburban communities. Heroin is cheap, deadly and surging in popularity and is now an alarming problem in this area where it was once rare and is to blame for a growing number of arrests and overdoses, Ryder said in the press release. People can become addicted to prescription drugs such as OxyContin and Oxycodone thinking they are not dangerous and then move on to much cheaper and readily available heroin.",0,8,5

Jim DeWees of the Maryland State Police, Chief Bernie Gerst of the Towson University Police Department, Major Steve Reynolds of the Carroll County Sheriffs Office and many members of the Maryland State Police and Westminster Police Departments.  I also want to recognize and thank Mr. Ram Javia (the owner of our Dunkin Donuts) and his incredible staff for partnering with us once again this year and taking such good care of our volunteers during the 30+ hours we took over his business.  Mr. Javia also made a very generous donation of $350 this afternoon to bring us to an even $6,000 – despite the fact that Lt. DeWees ate that least that much in donuts in the last two days.  Very generous! I also want to say thanks to the citizens of Carroll County who took time out of their busy lives to come to Dunkin Donuts and contribute to this great effort.  Truly, all of our planning would have meant nothing if the members of our community had not come out to support this great cause. Some of the totals are coming in from our colleagues around the state.  Laurel is currently leading the pack with $7,100.  The MDTA Police reported in at $4,700 from Reisterstown and Hyattsville PD came in with $5,030.  We are collectively hoping for a total of more than $40,000 for our efforts statewide…not bad for a 30 hour period.

DeWees. As of 3 p.m. they had raised just over $2,000 for the Maryland Special Olympics which is a great show of support from the Westminster community, but they have a long way to go to meet their goal of $10,000. Chief Spaulding said that last year, the inaugural year for this event in Carroll County, their goal was $5000 and they raised just over $8,000. He said hes optimistic that they can meet their goal this year. So Westminster: its coffee and donut time. Spaulding, DeWees and a host of supporters (including families, Special Olympics participants and other law enforcement officials) will be pulling an all-nighter at Dunkin Donuts tonight in an effort to raise money. If there was ever a good time to get some donuts for breakfast or an afternoon iced coffee, this is it.  12:30 p.m. Saturday: Chief Jeffrey Spaulding writes: Lt. DeWees, Chief Bernie Gerst and I are perched on the roof here in Westminster and all is well…if not a little warm.  The community has been very forthcoming…we have over $1,200 in donations thus far but still a LONG way to go to reach our goal of $10,000.  Thanks to all who have supported our effort so far.  Our family event begins in 30 minutes, so bring the kids and have some fun.  Face painting, crafts, a rock wall, moon bounce and several interesting demonstrations, so come on out and join us! 9:06 a.m. Saturday: Chief Jeffrey Spaulding writes:  7:08 a.m. Saturday: Chief Jeffrey Spaudling writes:  6:25 a.m. Saturday: Chief Jeffrey Spaulding writes:",0,8,5

57,57,"Law enforcement agencies in Sonoma and Marin counties teamed up to identify and arrest a Rohnert Park man early this morning on suspicion of committing seven armed robberies and attempted robberies since August. William Drew Hodges, 51, was arrested by a Sonoma County sheriffs SWAT team around 12:30 a.m. Tuesday at his residence in the 200 block of Allan Avenue in Rohnert Park. Detectives from the Rohnert Park Department of Public Safety and Santa Rosa Police Department participated in the service of a search warrant at the residence, and the arrest and subsequent interview of Hodges. Authorities found a black BB gun in Hodges car that resembled a real firearm and clothing in his car and bedroom that matched clothing seen in surveillance video at several businesses that were robbed, public safety officials said. Hodges admitted committing the seven robberies with a BB gun in Sonoma and Marin counties, according to the Department of Public Safety. He was booked into Sonoma County Jail on a no-bail warrant for absconding his parole for a 2010 conviction for robbery and assault with a deadly weapon in Sonoma County, and under $100,000 bail for the robbery of a nail salon in Rohnert Park on Sunday. Hodges and his vehicle were seen in a video in the area of the Rohnert Park nail salon just before the robbery, public safety officials said. His arrest came after San Rafael police called the Rohnert Park Department of Public Safety on Sunday to report an attempted robbery on Friday that was similar to the nail salon robbery. San Rafael police had identified Hodges as the suspect, along with his vehicle which was very distinct, public safety officials said. Rohnert Park detectives then began working with detectives and officers from the Sonoma County Sheriffs Office and the Santa Rosa, San Rafael, Petaluma and Cotati police departments regarding all of the robberies. Monday evening, Hodges vehicle was located in the driveway of a home in the 200 block of Allan Avenue in Rohnert Park. While continuing to work with the other departments, Rohnert Park detectives obtained an arrest warrant for Hodges in connection with the Rohnert Park robbery — as well as a search warrant for the house where his car was found. When the time came to serve the warrant, the assistance of the sheriffs SWAT team was sought because of Hodges having reportedly used a handgun in the robberies. Hodges is said to have exited the house as requested by the SWAT team. He was then placed under arrest without incident, public safety officials said. Hodges also is suspected of robbing Sally Beauty Supply in Santa Rosa late Monday morning, Yogurt World Sept. 23 in Petaluma, Palm Beach Tan shop Friday in Petaluma and Sees Candies Sept. 15 in Petaluma.

Winner Ford of Cherry Hill was accused of paying its Chinese emergency and accessory installation (EAI) technicians less than technicians at the same location who werent Chinese. They were paid up to $3 an hour less than other technicians who were doing the same work and — in some cases — had less experience, according to the EEOC. When one of the employees complained, the EEOC alleges that employee was reprimanded and warned not to seek legal advice or he would be out of a job. The issue dates back to 2010, according to EEOC. In addition to the $150,000 in lost wages and other damages to the class members, the three-year consent decree prohibits Winner Ford from discriminating based on national origin, including in compensation, or engaging in retaliation. Winner Ford must also implement an anti-discrimination policy to all employees, applicants and new hires, according to the settlement. It must also provide training on federal EEO laws to all managers and employees involved in setting wages or handling discrimination complaints, and post a notice regarding the settlement. Workers deserve equal pay for equal work, EEOC Regional Attorney Debra M. Lawrence said. We are pleased that Winner Ford worked with us to address these pay disparities and that it will take affirmative measures to ensure that no workers are paid less based on national origin. Strong enforcement of the pay laws is one of the Commissions priority issues, EEOC District Director Kevin Berry said. The EEOC provides resources, including outreach and training, to assist employers in abiding by these laws, but we will litigate when an employer makes unlawful employment decisions.

Louis Arcila, 51, is due back in court on April 27 for sentencing. He faces up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. While most police officers honorably protect, and defend the public, this defendants conduct was an outrageous abuse of his authority, a betrayal of the oath he took, and a crime that victimized an innocent young mother, said Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas.

97,97,"Less than 24 hours after two Virginia journalists were killed in an on-air shooting, their station, WDBJ in Roanoke, opened its Thursday morning news broadcast with a somber tribute, followed by a moment of silence and many more moments of tears. Reporter Alison Parker, 24, and cameraman Adam Ward, 27, were killed Wednesday by a former reporter at the station, Vester Lee Flanagan, who hours later killed himself. Shortly after the start of Thursdays newscast, precisely 24 hours after the two young lives lost, anchor Kim McBroom grasped the hands of two colleagues sitting on either side of her. We are approaching a moment that none of us will ever forget, McBroom said with a shaky voice. Pictures of Parker and Ward were displayed on screen. The show went silent. Here are those moments from Thursday and what else you may want to know about Wednesdays shooting.  Later they held a moment of silence at the 24-hour mark of the killing:  What else you need to know: The shooter was a former station employee WDBJ station manager Jeff Marks said on air that Flanagan worked at WDBJ during 2012 and 2013, using the on-air name Bryce Williams.  Vester was an unhappy man. We employed him as a reporter and he had some talent in that respect and some experience, Marks said, according to the Washington Post. He quickly gathered a reputation of someone who was difficult to work with. He was sort of looking out for people to say things he could take offense to. Eventually, after many incidents of his anger, we dismissed him. He did not take that well. We had to call police to escort him from the building. Williams filed an action with the Equal Opportunity Employment Committee that employees had made racist comments to him. But the complaint was dismissed when, Marks said, none of them could be corroborated by anyone. We think they were fabricated. At least one of his previous employers had a similar experience Flanagan previously worked at KPIX in San Francisco, WTWC in Tallahassee, Florida, and WTOC Savannah, Georgia. Don Shafer, now news director at San Diego, hired, and later fired the shooter in Tallahassee, when he went by the name of Vester Flanagan. During an on-air interview this morning, Shafer said that Flanagan was good at his job and then things started getting a little strange with him. Flanagan was let go because of bizarre behavior and fighting with other employees. He threatened to punch people out and he was running fairly rough-shod over other folks. The morning anchor is taking time off Both Parker and Ward were romantically involved with employees at the station, leading to touching tributes on social media. We didnt share this publicly, but (Parker) and I were very much in love. We just moved in together. I am numb, Chris Hurst, an anchor at the station, tweeted shortly after the killing. He said later that he needed time away from the job but would return before too long because that is what Parker would have wanted. We were together almost nine months. It was the best nine months of our lives. We wanted to get married.We just celebrated her 24th birthday… She was the most radiant woman I ever met. And for some reason she loved me back. She loved her family, her parents and her brother. Ward was engaged to a producer at the television station. Parker and Ward worked together often. Flanagan posted the shooting on social media Shortly after the shooting, Flanagan took to his social media pages — which were under his Bryce Williams pseudonym — and posted a first-person video of the shooting. I filmed the shooting see Facebook, he wrote on the Twitter account, before posting the video on Twitter, too. He also referenced his alleged discrimination, saying, Alison made racist comments and EEOC report filed. The video shows him approaching the live interview holding a pistol, then lowering it when the camera pans away from the liveshot. He waits until the camera is back on the reporter and opens fire. Twitter quickly suspended his account, and Facebook followed shortly after. Patch has decided not to link to or embed the video. The gunman died at the hospital after a police chase After the shooting, Flanagan fled, leading police on a chase across Virginia. He refused to pull over for police and eventually crashed his car on Interstate 66 in Faquier County almost 200 miles away, according to state police. When authorities approached the vehicle, Flanagan shot himself but didnt die immediately. He was taken to an area hospital via airlift and treated for life-threatening injuries, police say. He was pronounced dead at 1:26 p.m., according to Virginias secretary of public safety. Image via WDBJ",0,8,5
98,98,"A distraught and potentially suicidal man stole a Horizon Air Q400 turboprop plane from Sea-Tac Airport Friday night, eventually crashing the commercial jet into Ketron Island in Pierce county, officials said. The Seattle Times first reported Saturday that the 29-year-old Horizon Air employee is Richard Beebo Russell. The plane was stolen around 8:30 p.m. Friday while it was in a maintenance position, meaning it was not scheduled for take-off. Russell worked as a ground service employee at Sea-Tac and was the only person on board the plane, according to Alaska Airlines. On Saturday evening, Russells family released a statement saying they are shocked at what he did. The statement said that the family will not comment further on the matter, asking for space as they mourn the man they call Beebo. This is a complete shock to us. We are devastated by these events and Jesus is truly the only one holding this family together right now. Without Him we would be hopeless. As the voice recordings show, Beebos intent was not to harm anyone and he was right in saying that there are so many people who loved him, the statement read in part. Saturday morning, Alaska Airlines CEO Brad Tilden expressed sympathy for Russells family. He said Alaska would use the incident to learn how to prevent such an incident in the future. Alaska is Horizon Airs parent company. I want to acknowledge and express my gratitude to the FAA air traffic control professionals, the Washington and Oregon Air National Guard and the Pierce County first responders for their strong and professional response to last nights event, Tilden said. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) dispatched two F-15C fighter jets from Portland to intercept the stolen aircraft in the vicinity of McChord Air Force Base. NORAD said the fighters were working to redirect the aircraft out over the Pacific Ocean when it crashed. The fighters did not fire on the aircraft, NORAD said. Special Agent Jay S. Tabb said Saturday morning that the FBI will lead the investigation into the plane theft with assistance from the FAA and NTSB. The FBI declined to confirm that Russell is the person who stole and crashed the plane. According to social media profiles, Russell was born in Florida, grew up in Alaska, and lived in Sumner. He was married and made recordings recently with his Horizon Air coworkers. Thousands of Puget Sound residents witnessed the plane flying over the region. Scores of photographs and videos captured the incident from its startling beginning to its tragic end. There are still a lot of unknowns surrounding tonights tragic incident of a stolen Horizon Airline plane, Gov. Jay Inslee said in a pair of tweets. The responding fighter pilots flew alongside the aircraft and were ready to do whatever was needed to protect us, but in the end the man flying the stolen plane crashed. I want to thank the Air National Guard from Washington and Oregon for scrambling jets to keep Washingtonians safe. Those pilots are trained for moments like tonight and showed they are ready and capable. Normal operations resumed at Sea-Tac shortly after the stolen plane crashed. Russell could be heard on audio recordings telling air traffic controllers that he is just a broken guy.An air traffic controller refers to him as Rich. There is a runway just off to your right side in about a mile, the controller says, trying to get Russell to land at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Oh man. Those guys will rough me up if I try and land there, the man responded, later adding This is probably jail time for life, huh? Later Russell said: Ive got a lot of people that care about me. Its going to disappoint them to hear that I did this...Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Officials said Saturday that the Russell was a 3-1/2 year Horizon employee and had clearance to be among aircraft, but that to their knowledge. He wasnt a licensed pilot. The Pierce County Sheriffs Office said Friday night that the employee acted alone and described him as suicidal. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said President Trump has been briefed on the situation. Horizon Air Chief Operating Officer Constance van Muehlen said in a video statement posted to Twitter that the companys hearts were with the family of the individual onboard as well as all the Alaska Air and Horizon Air employees. Horizon Air is a regional airline that is part of Alaska Air group. The airplane crash sparked a brush fire that was still burning across about two acres Saturday morning, according to the state Department of Natural Resources. No injuries were reported on the barely populated island.  Reporting from The Associated Press was used in this report.

128,128,"A nationwide arrest warrant has been issued for a Lakeville man – a former police officer – accused of stalking a woman, threatening to kill himself in front of her. John Edward Harmon, 50, is charged with felony stalking or harassment, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. The charge has a mandatory minimum penalty of three years in prison and a $3,000 fine. Lakeville police were asked to check on Harmons welfare at about 6 p.m. Jan. 3, according to the criminal complaint. The request was made by Harmons ex-girlfriend, who said Harmon had recently called her and told her, Im going to find you and blow my brains out in front of you so you can remember it for every waking moment of your life, the complaint says. After Harmon made that remark, the call was disconnected, the woman told police. She said that Harmon, a former police officer in Faribault, appeared very unstable and that he carried at least one handgun all the time, though he does not have a permit to carry a firearm. Police contacted Harmons cell-phone provider and discovered that his phone was at his home in the 16300 block of Linch Avenue. Officers made numerous attempts to contact him via cell phone and text message, but none of the calls or messages were answered. Police kept two squad cars near Harmons home, but were unable to locate him. At about 10:30 a.m. Jan. 5, the mother of Harmons ex-girlfriend called police and said Harmon had called to wish her a happy birthday, then told her he had been up all night listening to the devil, according to the complaint. Harmon also read the woman a letter that he had written to her daughter, in which he said he wanted her daughter to suffer the way he was suffering and that he wanted to hurt her the way she had hurt him, the woman told police. The woman also said that Harmon had implied that he was suicidal, saying he would like to be in the cemetery and that he planned to go into the woods and let nature take its course. When the woman told Harmon not to hurt himself on her birthday, he said he would wait until the next day. Police again contacted Harmons cell-phone provider and learned that his phone was still at his Lakeville home. Officers got a search warrant for his house and were able to reach him by telephone, but he refused to come out of his house. While officers were outside the house, they spotted Harmon on the roof, where he yelled to officers to just shoot me. After negotiating with Harmon for a lengthy period, police broke into Harmons home and used tear gas to get him to leave. After subduing Harmon, police found that he was wearing a bulletproof vest beneath several coats. He was taken to a hospital via ambulance. Harmon was fired from the Faribault police force in September 2010 after being deemed unfit for duty. He had been a patrol officer with the department since 1992. Harmons whereabouts are unknown.

131,131,"The first heat wave of the summer will wash over the Southland this weekend, sending temperatures into triple-digit territory amid an elevated danger of wildfire. The National Weather Service has issuing an excessive heat watch from Friday morning through Saturday evening, and Fridays temperatures are expected to break records in many cities and triple-digit temperatures sticking around Saturday before dropping around 10-12 degrees Sunday and into Monday. The heat watch will be in effect along the Central Coast, in Ventura County, in Orange County and in all of L.A. County, including beach cities, metropolitan L.A., the Downtown area and the Hollywood Hills, all valley areas, and both the San Gabriel and Santa Monica mountains. Wednesdays high in downtown Los Angeles was 83. Thats expected to go up a couple degrees Thursday before the heat wave begins. The two worst days by far will be Friday and Saturday, when highs are expected to reach at least 102 degrees along the coast, 106 in the mountains, 107 in inland Orange County, and 112 in L.A. County valleys, according to the NWS. Forecasters also warned that low humidity on Thursday night and Friday could increase the fire risk even more. The weather service stressed that the type of temperatures create an increased potential for heat-related illnesses. Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside, the NWS statement urged. When possible, reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Wear lightweight and loose-fitting clothing when possible and drink plenty of water. Especially important is to never, ever, leave people or pets in enclosed vehicles, even for a short period of time. Temperatures inside vehicles, even if the windows are partially open, can quickly rise to life- threatening levels. Libraries and municipal facilities such as recreation centers, senior centers and museums can serve as cooling centers for the public during normal hours of operation. Find your nearest facility at laparks.org/reccenter, laparks.org/scc or lapl.org/branches.

133,133,"National School Bus Safety Week begins today, and the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles has teamed up with the departments of Education and Transportation to develop the Stop on Red, Kids Ahead campaign. The goal is to encourage motorists to become familiar with the laws and safe practices associated with approaching a school bus. What Drivers Need to Know: Florida Motor Vehicles laws require that drivers stop if they approach any school bus that displays its flashing red lights and has its stop signs extended. The only exception is when a vehicle is traveling in the opposite direction of the school bus on a divided highway with an unpaved space of at least five feet or on a divided highway with a raised median or a physical barrier. Passing illegally on the left hand side carries a $165 fine for the first offense; passing on the right will cost drivers $265. In Florida, there are more than 8,900 drivers who pass school buses illegally each day. Any of those instances could result in a students injury or even death. School bus safety is everyones responsibility, said Col. David Brierton, director of the Florida Highway Patrol. School buses transport Floridas future and we need to work together to ensure the safety of our children on Floridas roadways.

134,134,"The folllowing information was provided by the Lower Moreland Police Department: Feb. 9 – Weapons Possession During the snowstorm last week, a Lower Moreland Police Officer noticed a black Nissan Sentra on Red Lion Road stranded in the lane of traffic with four inches of snow on the ground. The officer used his car to push the Nissan onto Dale Road so snow plows could clear the streets. Once the car was on Dale Rd., the officer approached the car to find the driver, Francis Mcalorum, 26, of Philadelphia, having blood shot eyes and the officer also detected a strong smell of marijuana. As the officer began to question him, he noticed a black handled knife attached to the dash board just above the radio. The officer had Mcalorum exit the car. Once Mcalorum was out of his car, he admitted he had another knife, which was attached to his belt. The officer placed him in handcuffs for safety reasons. Mcalorum admitted to smoking pot with his girlfriend earlier in the day, and police seized a Ziploc bag containing a green leafy substance believed to be pot from his car.

136,136,"A former lawyer from Flemington, who defrauded lenders out of $40.8 million in a mortgage loan scheme was sentenced Wednesday to 48 months in prison, U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman announced. Joseph W. Witkowski, 70, of Flemington, previously pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. U.S. District Judge Joseph H. Rodriguez imposed the sentence on March 8 in Camden federal court. Witkowski and his conspirators were found to have located oceanfront condominiums overbuilt by financially distressed developers in Wildwood Crest, New Jersey; premier real estate in vacation destinations in Georgia and South Carolina; and properties in New Jersey owned by financially distressed homeowners facing foreclosure. They then recruited straw buyers – people with good credit scores but lacking the financial resources to qualify for mortgage loans – to purchase those properties, according to documents filed in this case and statements made in court. Witkowski and his conspirators created false documents, including fake W-2 forms, income tax returns, investment statements, and rental agreements, to make the straw buyers appear more creditworthy than they actually were. They also established numerous telephone lines for companies owned by some of the conspirators so that when a lender contacted the telephone number, the conspirators could falsely verify that a straw buyer was employed by the company listed on his or her fraudulent loan application, according to documents filed in this case and statements made in court. Witkowski also caused fraudulent mortgage loan applications in the name of the straw buyers and supporting documents, which attributed to the straw buyers inflated income and assets, to be submitted to mortgage lenders. Once the loans were approved and the mortgage lenders sent the loan proceeds in connection with real estate closings on the properties, Witkowski and his conspirators had some of the funds wired or checks deposited into various accounts that he and his conspirators controlled, according to the report. In addition to the prison term, Judge Rodriguez sentenced Witkowski to three years of supervised release and ordered restitution of $13,105570. As part of his plea agreement, he must forfeit $2,412,899, representing the proceeds of the fraud. (Image via Mark Moz) Have a news tip? Email alexis.tarrazi@patch.com.

138,138,"Last November, the Quonset Development Corporation gave the town until June 30 to relocate its fire maintenance operation, which has been housed in a building on Power Street. That move had been a long time coming, officials acknowledge. Ocean State Job Lot acquired an option to buy the property from QDC several years ago and that option expires in November. So, the town must move its fire maintenance. There are options, but the Town Council has not yet committed to a plan. Several weeks ago, Town Manager Michael Embury told the Council he was negotiating with QDC on a long-term lease for the old Bostitch building on Callahan Road. QDC approved a 10-year, $1.2 million lease on the building, with Town Councilors Liz Dolan and Richard Welch (who also sit on the QDC board) abstaining. The Council, however, voted 2-3 against the lease option, with Dolan and Carol Hueston voting for it and Welch, Kerry McKay and Kevin Maloney voting against. It was not a permanent answer, said Welch. It was a 10-year lease with no option to buy. It requires an awful lot of work to the building to accommodate the different uses needed. The town does own land next to the Department of Public Works facility on Babcock Road. In fact, Embury and others say the land was acquired six years ago to provide space to build a fire maintenance facility. But the towns arrangement with QDC for use of the building on Power Street – the town pays no rent, only the cost of utilities – made any move that would cost significant money easy to put off. After the Town Council failed to approve leasing the Bostitch building, discussion of what to do turned to the possibility of purchasing a prefabricated structure to place at on that town-owned land next to DPW. Fire maintenance is not the only piece of the puzzle however. The town is also looking to maintain a climate-controlled document storage space and it would like a place to house golf carts. It quickly became clear at a meeting earlier this month that there were many unanswered questions regarding such a project, including whether or not the land next to DPW could accommodate a building large enough for all those purposes. For Welch, the June 30 deadline is an artificial emergency. Is there an emergency here? I dont believe it is, he said. Its not an emergency until the weather gets cold. In the meantime, he said, the Town Council needs to look at issue with an eye to a more permanent solution. As for fire maintenance in the interim? The town could use space at DPW, Welch suggested. For Embury, theres a sense of frustration. The property was bought about six years ago, he said. We knew it was coming. Were here. The council has tapped the School Facilities Committee to look at the various options. The topic will be back on the councils agenda at its meeting on Monday.",0,8,5

144,144,"A Detroit mom is accused of beating up her 15-year-old daughter because she is gay, according to media reports. Iyesha K. Porter, 34, was charged earlier this month with third-degree felony child abuse and assault and battery in a case prosecuted by Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthys office and supported by the Fair Michigan Justice Project. The alleged assault occurred on Nov. 11 after Porter discovered letters her daughter and another female teen had exchanged. According to media reports, Porter signed her daughter out of school and took her home, where she allegedly hit, kicked and pushed her while shouting gay slurs. The teen has been placed in her fathers custody, and a no-contact order issued by the court prohibits Porter from contacting her daughter. Porter allegedly disowned her daughter and said she was too young to be a (expletive/slur), Detroit Police Officer Donnie Harris said during a hearing on the charges this week, WDIV-TV reported. The daughter took the stand as well and said that she was scared about how her mother would react when she learned of her sexual orientation, WJBK reported. Her fears werent unfounded. Dana Nessel, president of Fair Michigan, a group that advocates for LGBTQ individuals in the absence of civil rights protections for them in Michigans Constitution — said the teens account of what happened isnt all that unusual, but similar occurrences had been swept under the rug. This case is an unfortunate example of the physical and mental harm that LGBTQ youths suffer when their sexual orientation is discovered by hostile family members, Nessel said. The Fair Michigan Justice Project, in association with the Wayne County Prosecutors Office and the Detroit Police Department, stands ready to aggressively prosecute these brutal crimes committed against members of the LGBTQ community. Nessel said the case sends a strong message that it is not appropriate to deal with your child this way under any set of circumstances but that being bisexual, gay or trans is nothing a child should be punished for. Often, she said, teens who are kicked out of their homes because of their sexual orientation end up on the streets, turn to drugs or even commit suicide. We cant let this happen anymore, Nessel said.

152,152,"by Patricia A. Miller You couldnt blame Seaside Heights police if they were a little nervous about preparing for the arrival of 30,000 people in town for the recent Gentlemen of the Road music festival. The Ocean County Sheriffs Department was on the scene with a mobile command unit, eight bomb-sniffing dogs made periodic inspections through the crowds, security was increased and an officer even patrolled the beach on horseback, Police Chief Thomas J. Boyd said. In the end, none of the beefed-up security was needed. It was the nicest group of people weve ever had in Seaside Heights, the chief said. Ive been here for 53 years and been an officer for 31 years. The people were so nice, it was scary. The British group Mumford and Sons and a number of other bands performed on June 5 and June 6. At one point, there were 20,000 people camped on the beach, Boyd said. They are a class act, the chief said of the band. It was just a real professionally-run event.

166,166,"Two North Bay men have been arrested following a months-long investigation into a San Francisco womans account of being kidnapped from San Francisco and driven to Sonoma County where she was violently sexually assaulted. Fredi Analberto Lopez-Flores, 33, of Novato, was taken into custody Friday in connection with the April 14 rape and kidnapping and Christian Alejandro Quintero, 24, of Sonoma, was arrested Saturday, a Sonoma County Sheriffs Office spokesman said Monday. This incident began when a San Francisco woman got into what she thought was a ride-sharing car after leaving Brunos Bar in San Francisco, said sheriffs Sgt. Spencer Crum. The suspects took her to Sonoma where she was beaten, choked and sexually assaulted by two men in the car. She eventually escaped and was aided by a Safeway employee. Following more than 2,000 hours of staff time, Crum said detectives have determined Quintero and Lopez-Flores were not drivers for any ride-sharing company. Rather, it was a random attack, Crum said. The suspects found the woman standing on the corner of Stanyan Street and Fulton Street in San Francisco, waiting for a ride on the morning of April 14 when Lopez-Flores drove up next to her, Crum said. She had actually taken a ride share from Brunos Bar in the Mission District to this location accidentally and was waiting for a second ride share to get her home. PREVIOUS: Woman Hails Ride In SF, Found Sexually Assaulted In Sonoma: Cops Detectives allege Quintero got out of the car and forced the victim into the back seat of Lopez-Flores car. There, he violently beat and attacked her all the way to Sonoma, Crum said. Once they got to Quinteros neighborhood, they pulled over in a shopping center across from Safeway where Quintero continued to attack and sexually assault her, Crum said. While this occurred, Lopez-Flores walked to the gas station and bought a condom and then he got into the back seat and sexually assaulted the woman. Evidence in the case was gathered by reviewing countless hours of surveillance video from various businesses and bridge cameras. In watching the video they identified one suspect who was seen at about the time of the crime, entering a gas station across the street from the crime scene in Sonoma, Crum said. In this video he was seen purchasing a condom. Numerous search warrants were also written, Crum said, one key warrant being for the victims cellular phone which provided data telling detectives approximately when she crossed the Golden Gate Bridge. Detectives used that information and wrote a warrant for Golden Gate Bridge District surveillance video which was ultimately supplied. While watching that video, detectives observed a black Dodge Magnum car with a specific blue neon license plate light, Crum said. This Dodge Magnum with the neon light was also captured on video from various business surveillance systems in Sonoma. A flier showing the car with its neon light was put out to local law enforcement agencies. The flier also showed the suspect in the gas station. An officer from the Novato Police Department recognized the suspect and distinctive vehicle from a recent unrelated arrest where he towed the suspects car, Crum said. With that suspect identified as Lopez-Flores, Sonoma County detectives wrote a warrant for Lope-Flores cellphone records. These records indicated that Lopez-Flores was in San Francisco on the morning of April 14, 2018 and in the area where the victim was forced into the car and drove north across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sonoma at the same time the victim came to Sonoma, Crum said. Detectives used probable cause to obtain a $2 million warrant for Lopez-Flores arrest. He was taken into custody Friday in San Rafael where he works doing general labor, Crum said. Detectives also determined that the morning of April 14, Lopez-Flores was with his friend, Quintero, who lives about a block away from where the alleged violent attack happened, Crum said. A search warrant was served at Quinteros home, where physical evidence of the crime was allegedly located. Quintero was arrested Saturday at his workplace in Sonoma. Both men were booked into the Sonoma County Jail on suspicion of numerous sex crimes and assault charges. Lopez-Flores is being held on $2 million bail, while Quintero is being held without bail due to an alleged attempted murder charge associated with the case, Crum said. This investigation was very extensive and involved over 2,000 hours of staff time and approximately 20 search warrants written and issued, Crum said. The investigation took detectives to nine different counties and required cooperation from numerous agencies and private businesses. We wish to thank everyone who helped solve this crime.

178,178,"An East Brunswick man was arrested Friday morning on charges that he stole computer files containing trade secrets from a DuPont manufacturing facility in Parlin, New Jersey. Anchi Hou, 61, of East Brunswick, was charged with one count of theft of trade secrets. He is scheduled to appear at 2:00 p.m. Friday before Judge Waldor in Newark federal court. U.S. attorneys allege that sometime between last summer and fall, 2016, Hou allegedly copied and removed thousands of files containing DuPonts proprietary information, including formulas, data and customer information related to flexographic printing plate technology. He also allegedly took photographs in restricted areas of plant equipment and layouts used to manufacture DuPonts products. The DuPont plant is located on Cheesequake Road in Parlin. After allegedly stealing DuPonts trade secrets, Hou announced his intention to retire from the company by the end of 2016. At some point in 2016, he formed a consulting business intended to provide consulting services to the manufacturing industry. Hou admitted to DuPont officials he secretly copied the files from his DuPont work computer and then uploaded those files onto a personal computer at his residence in order to assist him with his consulting business. A forensic review of Hous personal computer revealed that it contained more than 20,000 stolen DuPont files related to the companys flexographic printing plate technology. Some of the stolen files include information that DuPont considers trade secrets developed by its employees over the course of the past 40 years and which are critical to its technical, economic and business operations. The theft of trade secrets charge carries a maximum potential penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross pecuniary gain or loss. Acting U.S. Attorney William Fitzpatrick thanked security officials in the DuPont corporation for their cooperation in the investigation. Wikimedia Commons image of a DuPont plant",0,8,5

182,182,"A Brookfield man already charged with stealing dozens of expensive toilet valves from fast-food restaurant and institutional restrooms has also been charged with six counts of identity theft for using a plumbing companys name to fence them. Cory James Feerick, 33, of Brookfield was charged March 28 in Waukesha County with five counts of theft of property and on April 16 in Milwaukee County with six counts of felony identity theft. Each count of property theft is a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months in jail. The new identity theft charges each carry a maximum penalty of up to six years in prison. According to criminal complaint in the newly filed identity theft cases: From Sept. 21 through Jan. 10, Feerick stole four flush valves from a Root River Parkway pavilion in Greendale, seven from Milwaukee Area Technical College in Milwaukee, two from a McDonalds restaurant in West Allis, six from ITT Technical Institute in Greenfield, and a whopping 32 from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, for a total of 51. But that wasnt all. The Waukesha County theft charges detail disappearing toilet valves attributed to Feericks work at a Brookfield Pick n Save, two thefts about a month apart from the same Arbys restaurant on Capitol Drive in Brookfield, and two separate thefts two days apart from Waukesha County Technical College in Pewaukee. In addition, stolen toilet valves were reported during the same period from the Mayfair Road Taco Bell and the Burleigh Street Cousins Subs shop in Wauwatosa, and from a number of other locations in Milwaukee. Wauwatosa police said they suspected Feerick in those cases and offered to assist in the investigation and prosecution but were told to wait for the Waukesha County investigation to unfold. Yet more charges could potentially be filed. It was Feericks rampant theft of valves at UWM that undid him, Brookfield police said in January. On Jan. 13, UWM police asked the City of Brookfield police to assist in the arrest of Feerick at his residence in the 4000 block of North 135th Street, and he was taken into custody. During the course of the investigation, police got a tip that Feerick had been selling the stolen valves at National Salvage, 600 S. 44th St. in Milwaukee. UWM police spoke to a representative of the company who said that each time Feerick sold valves there he filled out an ownership questionnaire indicating he was doing so in the name of AJ Graf Plumbing in Kenosha, and he presented a valid drivers license as required. Feerick told National Salvage, the company representative said, that the valves were scrap from a Kenosha commercial jobsite. The owner of AJ Graf told police that Feerick had worked for him before, last in June 2012, and then only on residential jobs, never commercial sites. He said he had never given Feerick permission to sell materials for salvage. All told, police believe that Feerick stole more than $30,000 worth of valves, each costing from $300 to $600 to replace, not counting installation. For that, the six visits Feerick paid to National Salvage netted him less than $600 in scrap value at around $2 a pound for the plumbing fixtures.",0,8,5

Sophia Clarke, 48, presented forged credentials to colleges she taught after she had her nursing license revoked by state authorities, the DA says. She was arraigned Wednesday for second-degree grand larceny, second-degree criminal possession of a forged instrument and first-degree scheme to defraud. Because of their lifesaving role in our healthcare system, its essential that only licensed professionals be allowed teach nursing to students, Singas said in a press release. Im grateful to the New York State Board of Education, BMCC and Adelphi University for their assistance with this investigation. According to the DA, Clarke, who began teaching at the Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) in August 2011, had her registered professional nurse and nurse practitioner licenses revoked in February 2012. She continued to teach and never told BMCC that her licenses were revoked, the DA says. Clarke was then hired in August 2012 to teach at Adelphi University and provided the school with copies of licenses that had 2014 expiration dates, the DA says. She then re-submitted forged licenses with 2017 expiration dates to the school between April and May of 2014, the DA says. Clarke was scheduled to teach three classes at BMCC for the Fall 2018 semester, including a hospital clinic that would have involved practicing on actual patients, the DA says. She has since been been terminated from Adelphi University and was placed on leave from BMCC. She is no longer scheduled to teach in BMCCs Fall 2018 semester. Valid nursing licenses are requirements to teach at both schools. Clarke, following her arrest, was released on her own recognizance and is due back in court on Sept. 14.

205,205,"A warehouse employee stabbed two co-workers and held police at bay with a knife during a standoff Tuesday night. Around 9:15 p.m., Windsor Locks police were dispatched to C & S Wholesale Grocers at 500 North Street to investigate the report of a stabbing that had just occurred. The area is a very active warehouse of over a million square feet and 80+ employees at any given time, Det. Sgt. Paul Cherniack said in a written statement. Details were still coming in as officers arrived at C & S and they were directed to the warehouse loading docks. An officer was making his way toward the suspects location when he saw a shirtless 56-year-old man being tended to by a female employee. The male had been stabbed in the upper right back area, sustaining non-life threatening injuries, Cherniack said. Officers located the assailant and recognized an immediate threat to themselves and others nearby. The warehouse was in full operation and numerous employees were in the direct vicinity of the knife-wielding assailant who had already stabbed one person. The assailant was not responding to commands by officers to drop the weapon, Cherniack said. The suspect was acting erratically and remained unresponsive to officers commands. Suddenly he focused on one officer, moving toward him with the knife at the ready. The officer cautiously moved backward to provide a safe distance, giving the assailant every opportunity to stop his movement and drop the weapon. After intense communication by officers to the assailant, he was hit with one discharge from a conducted electrical weapon (CEW) Tazer, which had no effect, Cherniack said. The assailant again focused on the same officer as another officer moved to a position of tactical advantage and deployed the Tazer a second time, which now had its desired effect. Officers immediately moved in and restrained the suspect while kicking the knife away from his reach. The assailant remained violent and resisted arrest until finally subdued by officers, Cherniack said. The assailant was later identified as Hasudin Siljkovic, 27, of 388 Campfield Ave., Hartford. As the investigation continued, a second male, 27, was found to have been stabbed in his thumb by the assailant as well. This male was injured as he tried to block the assailants downward knife strike, Cherniack said. Siljkovic was transported to the hospital for evaluation while in police custody. The two victims were treated and released for non-life threatening wounds, according to Cherniack. Siljkovic was charged with two counts of second-degree assault, a Class D felony, and remains uncooperative, Cherniack said. The folding knife, with approximately a three-and-a-half-inch blade, was recovered at the scene. This incident was isolated and no further related threats exist. Management representatives of C & S were on-scene and fully cooperating with the ongoing investigation, Cherniack said. Photo courtesy of Windsor Locks Police Department",0,8,5

211,211,"Hazelwood is offering people that may have outstanding warrants an opportunity to clear the record. As part of Family Week 2011, Better Family Life (BFL) will be hosting workshops for the St. Louis Metropolitan Area Amnesty Project at three locations on the following dates: To qualify, citizens must attend one of these brief, 10-minute workshops and pay a $10 processing fee to obtain an amnesty voucher. The wanted individual is then required to take the amnesty voucher and report to the Hazelwood Court Division, or to any other municipal court where they have an outstanding misdemeanor warrant issued against them. This Amnesty Project provides a great opportunity for someone to correct a mistake they may have made by failing to appear in court for a traffic violation which caused a warrant to be issued, said Ginny Lorton, court administrator for the City of Hazelwood in a statement. Some of these individuals may not even know they have outstanding warrants on them from one or more municipalities. The voucher redemption period for the is from August 15 to August 31. Operating hours of the Hazelwood Court Division are Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Citizens must pay $100 in cash or money order for a bond which lifts the warrant. They will be required to return for another court date in October when the Judge will dispose of the matter. Outstanding warrants often create barriers for people such as finding employment, enrolling in college or trade school, getting an apartment, or applying for financial aid because having a clean police record is a requirement, Lorton said. By participating in this program, people can get these warrants erased from their record which can help improve the quality of their life. Last year, James Clark, BFLs vice president of Community Outreach, said they distributed over 14,000 vouchers. This year, with a new partnership with the St. Louis Community College, they hope to help even more individuals, he said. Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that the amnesty voucher processing fee was $100, with a subsequent $100 bond to lift the warrant.

According to sheriffs Sgt. John Sawyer, the undercover operation took place on Thursday and Friday and included the Riverside County Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force, the Riverside Police Departments Vice Unit and the Temecula Police Departments Problem Oriented Policing Team. Operation Reclaim and Rebuild was a coordinated statewide law enforcement effort seeking to send a clear message that human trafficking will not be tolerated in California, Sawyer said in a news release. During this three-day enforcement operation, participating law enforcement agencies throughout California proactively focused their efforts on rescuing human trafficking victims, identifying and arresting their captors, and disrupting the demand for sex trafficking victims. Here in Riverside County, undercover operatives placed ads online ...on a popular classified advertisement website commonly used for the solicitation of prostitution, according to the sergeant. The officers then responded to prospective customers who replied to the advertisement at locations set up in Riverside and Temecula, Sawyer said. These Johns were then arrested after their arrival upon brokering an arrangement for paid sex acts, he said. A total of 18 men were arrested on suspicion of solicitation for prostitution and were named by the sheriffs department as follows: Prostitution is not a victimless crime, Sawyer said in the news release. Ninety-five percent of sex trafficking victims are women or children...Sex trafficking victims are often subjected not only to severe forms of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse at the hands of their trafficker(s), but are also frequently physically and sexually assaulted by those that solicit them for prostitution.

214,214,"A Vineland man and former Buena Regional High School football star accused of killing a 45-year-old South Jersey woman at her home last month will be held pending trial. Tyler Dralle, 20, of Vineland, and a 17-year-old boy from New Castle, Delaware, were both charged with one count of felony murder in the death of Deanna Scordo. The boy is currently being held in a juvenile facility in Delaware. During Dralles pre-trial detention hearing Friday morning, Assistant Prosecutor Peter Gallagher argued that Dralle is too dangerous to be out on the streets, citing an incident in which he broke a mans arm during a fight about two weeks before Scordos death, the Courier Post reports. He also argued that Dralle did everything he could to mislead investigators, including lying about where he was the night of Scordos death and deleting thousands of text messages from his phone that made references to guns and burglaries. Dralle was a star football player in high school and college, according to NBC 10. After graduating from Buena Regional High School, he attended Mount San Antonio College in California, where he played linebacker. Scordo was shot and killed inside her home on the 700 block of Bairdmore Avenue in Winslow Township at about 3:49 a.m. on June 25, 2017. A 911 call obtained by Patch shows her father telling the dispatcher that two men wearing black hoods broke into the home, shot his daughter, and left her in a corner. Detectives pursued multiple leads in the weeks that followed, and offered a $5,000 reward for any information that lead to arrests and convictions in the case. Ultimately, detectives determined Dralle and the teenager were involved in the murder. Dralle was charged on Monday, and was arrested by the US Marshals Fugitive Task Force on Tuesday. He was arrested without incident at his home and remanded to Camden County Jail. The teenager was charged on Wednesday.

217,217,"Thousands of University of California service workers began a three-day strike Monday at campuses and medical facilities across the state, including at UCLA and UC Irvine Medical Center. Service workers represented by Local 3299 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees voted overwhelmingly last month to authorize a strike if no progress were made in negotiations. UC officials have repeatedly criticized the union for calling the strike, accusing the labor group of rejecting an offer of fair, multi-year wage increases and excellent medical and retirement benefits. The strike got off to a rocky start at UCLA, where a motorist apparently got impatient around 9:45 a.m., and tried to drive through the picketers crossing a street. Police and witnesses said a man in an SUV became irritated when union members were marching through the intersection of Westwood Plaza and Le Conte Avenue. Witnesses said the man initially got out of his SUV with some type of stick and threatened the picketers. He jumped back into his car, he gasses it, one union member told KNX Newsradio. Im holding on to his hood. He brakes, I thought he was going to stop, and as soon as Im trying to move he gasses it again and I just grabbed on again and as hes driving Im telling him to slow down. UCLA Police said three picketers were treated for minor injuries at the scene. The driver was taken into custody, although he appeared to have some difficulty breathing while being arrested and was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center to be checked out, police said. There were no other reports of any other clashes involving union protesters. In light of the impasse in contract talks, the university system last month imposed contract terms on the union for the 2017-18 fiscal year, including 2 percent pay increases. The UCs latest contract offer to the union included annual 3 percent raises over the next four years, according to the university. The union denounced the move to impose contract terms, responding by issuing a notice of a strike set to last until Wednesday. Weve bargained in good faith for over a year to address the widening income, racial and gender disparities that front-line, low-wage workers at UC are living every day, AFSCME Local 3299 President Kathryn Lybarger said. Instead of joining us in the effort to arrest these trends, UC has insisted on deepening them -- leaving workers no option but to strike. UC officials issued a statement saying they strongly disagree with AFSCMEs decision to strike, which will negatively impact patients, students and the UC community. We are doing everything in our power to limit disruptions on our campuses and medical centers to ensure our patients get the care they need and our students the services they deserve, according to the UC. The UC insisted that its service workers -- including custodians, gardeners, food service workers and facilities maintenance staff -- are compensated at or above the market rate, and in some cases, by as much as 17 percent higher than comparable jobs. University officials said the union is demanding a 6 percent annual wage increase, which is twice what other UC employees have received. They said their final officer included, in addition to the pay raises, a lump-sum payment upon contract ratification, health benefits consistent with those of other workers and continuation of pension benefits for existing employees. New employees would be given a choice between a pension or 401(K)- style retirement plan. Lybarger, however, accused the university of subverting the bargaining process by imposing contract terms on workers. Administrators are already showing us that we can expect more unequal treatment if we dont stand up, fight back and hold UC accountable to its hollow claims of pioneering a better future, Lybarger said. According to the union, the strike will involve 9,000 service workers, but they will be joined by more than 15,000 Patient Care Technical workers. The union represents workers such as security guards, groundskeepers, custodians, respiratory therapists, nursing aides and surgical technicians. The workers span UCs 10 campuses, five medical centers, numerous clinics and research laboratories, according to the union.

225,225,"EAST GREENWICH, RI—Three former students at Rocky Hill School have accused a former faculty member of sexual impropriety including one student who said they were raped in the late 1970s, according to school officials. The school community was notified on Monday in a letter outlining the allegations, which were brought forth by the victims after the school asked the school community in a July letter to share any concerns about past sexual misconduct. That letter was sent in response to shattering revelations unfolding at the elite St. Georges School in Middletown where more than 60 former students were sexually abused by a former coach, a music director and other students in the 1970s and 1980s. In Wednesdays letter, Head of School James Tracy and Edwin J. Santos, president of the Board of Trustees, said that three alumnae responded and said the former faculty member committed acts of sexual impropriety while they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and did not report the incident at the time or any time before now, the letter stated. That faculty member no longer works at the school and the Warwick Police Department was contacted immediately after the allegations, the letter stated, and the faculty member has been told to have no further contact with the school. The school has hired the law firm Nixon Peabody LLP to guide our comprehensive student safety and sexual misconduct policy review, the letter stated. The letter underscored the fact the incidents occurred decades ago by a faculty member no longer employed by the school and was informed of the prohibition on the same day the allegation of rape was made. The school is offering community members time to meet and answer questions and outline the protocols in place to provide the highest level of protection for our students against sexual violence. We understand that these allegations will be met by you with the same degree of shock and concern with which they were met by us, the letter stated. In a statement, Tracy said that Rocky Hill sought to be proactive as private schools across the country reckon with decades-old and often buried scars from sexual abuse. No school or institution of any kind, unfortunately, can be certain that such abuse has never transpired across decades of history, he said. Rocky Hill School is working closely with law enforcement and has launched its own internal investigation of the allegation. . . we applaud the three alumnae who had the courage to come forward and have again urged any other alumnae or current students who whish to report allegations of sexual misconduct to do so.

For their service, and the dogs exceptionally gentle character, the Wisconsin Veterinary Medical Association inducted Miller into the 2012 Wisconsin Pet Hall of Fame March 3, after his veterinarian Lisa Schultz, at , recommended him. Tushaus and his dog went through training to get accredited last spring as a therapy team, and have since been volunteering with Pets Helping People, an organization that connected them to the Congregation Home, as well as the Agnesian HealthCare Kids Survival Kamp, a bereavement camp for children. These are children that have lost a significant person in their life, Tushaus said. Theres times they act out or are having a bad time with something, and thats when Miller steps up to the plate, and will spend time one on one with that child. Instantly they seem to relate with him and he gives them a kiss or a hug. Tushaus said he decided to get involved with Pets Helping People because he had heard of pet-facilitated therapy, and noticed Miller had an especially calm and caring disposition. Hes very loving, Tushaus said. I thought this would be an opportunity to give back to the community and share him with other people.

236,236,"Photo courtesy of Facebook The FBI has determined that a 19-year-old Naperville man who was beaten in Iowa City was not the victim of a hate crime. Marcus Owens, a Naperville resident and student at the University of Iowa, claimed he was beaten and called a n----r by three white men as he was walking home from a bar. However, after reviewing surveillance footage and talking to multiple witnesses, the Iowa City Police Department and the FBI determined that Owens was involved in multiple altercations the night of April 30 and going into May 1. Sign up for the Patch newsletter The footage showed Owens entering Eden Lounge at 11:43 p.m. April 30 and becoming involved in an altercation at 1:32 a.m. He left the bar at 1:34 a.m. and was then involved with pushing and punching another person. Surveillance footage then shows Owens being removed from the area of Eden Lounge at 1:35 a.m. He attempted to re-enter the outside entry area of Eden Lounge, but was stopped by bar staff at 1:36 a.m. At 1:41 a.m., Owens was involved in another altercation at the intersection of Iowa Avenue and Linn Street. At 1:45 a.m. Owens was involved in a third altercation whereupon he grabbed onto another subject and attempted to strike the individual. Police then arrived on scene and Owen walked home with another person, police said. According to multiple witness accounts, Owens was reported to have made statements being concerned about his injuries sustained during the altercations and how he was going to inform his family, Iowa City police said in a statement. Police said as they investigated the incident, multiple reports confirmed that the original altercations stemmed from a disagreement between two students who are members of fraternities Pi Kappa Alpha and Kappa Sigma. According to witnesses, the n word was used by one individual at the time of the second altercation. The matter was referred to the FBI to assist in determining if what happened was a hate crime. The FBI found that the incident did not meet the criteria necessary to be labeled as one. All evidence gathered supports that this was an isolated incident that stemmed from an ongoing disagreement, police said. On May 16, Marcus Owens and his family issued an apology letter for the misunderstandings and anxiety stemming from Marcuss involvement in a violent incident in downtown Iowa City. Marcus now knows that his account of events was inconsistent with police findings, in part due to alcohol being involved, his embarrassment at his behavior, as well as the injuries he sustained, the letter said. In light of this, it was concluded that this incident was not a hate crime as originally believed, but rather a case of excessive underage drinking and extremely poor judgment on the part of many people, Marcus included. No charges are expected in the incident.",1,0,0

240,240,"Chesterfield chiropractor Anthony Calandro has been sentenced to 72 months in prison and order to pay approximately $1 million in restitution after pleading guilty to federal healthcare fraud charges last fall. United States District Judge E. Richard Webber also sentenced Calandros business, the Chiropractic Accident Centre of Crestwood, to two years of probation and ordered it pay a $2,000 special assessment. A press release from the U.S. Attorneys Office stated that Calandro had billed insurance companies for x-rays that were never taken and for appointments that patients canceled or had missed. In addition to the fraud charge, Calandro was convicted of three counts of making false statements while his corporation as a whole was convicted of four counts of making false statements. The U.S. Attorneys office has further details on how Calandro performed the fraud: According to testimony presented at trial, during 2010 and 2011, two undercover investigations revealed that Dr. Calandro and Ms. Rueter billed multiple insurance companies for services that were never rendered.  From 2006 to 2011, they submitted numerous reimbursement claims that falsely stated that the Chiropractic Centre had taken more x-rays than were actually taken.  In most instances, only one or two x-rays were taken during a patients visit, but many more x-ray views were billed. Since health insurance companies would not reimburse Chiropractic Centre if a claim indicated the patient had missed an appointment and had not received a billable service, they falsely indicated that a billable service had been provided to patients.  Using false codes, they submitted thousands of false claims for missed appointments. This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Assistant United States Attorneys Dorothy McMurtry and Dianna Collins prosecuted the case for the U.S. Attorneys Office.

246,246,"JAMAICA, QUEENS -- A Queens member of the notoriously violent MS-13 gang faces years behind bars and then deportation for beating and shooting a suspected rival gang member, federal prosecutors said. Kevin Stomper Paniagua, 19, pleaded guilty to attempted murder after he and two other gang members allegedly unleashed the execution-style attack in 2016 on the then-16-year-old boy, leaving him paralyzed. Paniagua and the two others - Jose Gonzalez, 19, and Francisco Ramos, 24 - allegedly plotted the murder attempt because they suspected the boy was a member of MS-13s rival 18th Street gang. MS-13 spreads fear throughout the community by killing suspected rival gang members and others who cross their path, said U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue. Paniagua admitted that on Oct. 23, 2016, he and the other gang members searched and waited for the teen in Jamaica, beating him as soon as he walked by. He then pulled out a gun and shot the teen in the face, but when he attempted to finish the job with a second shot, the gun jammed, according to court filings. Paniagua - who has no legal status in the U.S. - faces anywhere from 10 years to life in prison for the murder attempt, followed by deportation. His conviction is the latest in a series of federal prosecutions targeting members of MS-13. The gangs leadership is based in El Salvador and Honduras but thousands of members have planted roots across the United States. Since 2003, hundreds of MS-13 members, including dozens of clique leaders, have been convicted on federal felony charges in the Eastern District of New York, Donoghue said. The office has charged members with more than 45 murders in the district since 2010. Lead photo via Shutterstock",0,8,5
247,247,"A Long Beach man was sentenced Monday to 19 years to life in prison for fatally stabbing his ex-girlfriend, who had obtained a temporary restraining order against him just over a week earlier. Jurors found Ngounsay Keo, 60, was convicted in November of second-degree murder for the April 13, 2016, killing of Karina Duch, who was stabbed 19 times with a kitchen knife, according to Deputy District Attorney Kelly Kelley. Jurors also found true an allegation that he used a knife in the commission of the crime, along with convicting Keo of one count of criminal threats against the 40-year-old woman. Duch -- with whom Keo had a 23-year relationship and two children -- was found dead in a bedroom the couple had shared in the 1200 block of Stanley Avenue in Long Beach, the prosecutor said. The woman had moved out of the couples home with their children eight days earlier and obtained a temporary restraining order against him, Kelley said. It was unclear why Duch returned to the home. Forensic evidence indicated that the woman was stabbed in the living room and then moved to the bedroom after she died, the prosecutor said. Keo left a suicide note and an envelope with more than $2,500 in cash for the couples two sons and stabbed himself once, Kelley said. The couples 7-year-old son walked into the home, saw his father and then ran back to a neighbors house where he had been playing, and the neighbor called 911, according to the prosecutor. The boy was subsequently reunited with family members and his 14-year- old sibling. When officers responded to the home, Keo refused commands to drop a knife or to let officers into the residence, and officers used less lethal options to take him into custody, police said. Keo was subsequently taken to a local hospital where he underwent emergency surgery and was booked a day later. He has remained behind bars since then and will turn 61 in jail Tuesday.

Supposedly the people were in the (South Lake Tahoe) store either recording things with their camera or taking pictures of the product and that is on surveillance video. Ramos said investigators are waiting for Teaz N Pleaz management to give that footage to them to further the case. It definitely suggests some preplanning or some premeditation, if in fact the two are related, Ramos said. Teaz N Pleaz manager Chris Daniels described the footage from the South Lake Tahoe store and believes there is reason to believe the footage could be connected to the bandits involved with the robbery of the Sunrise Boulevard store. Daniels described an occasion two weeks prior to the Sunrise Blvd. incident where unknown individuals attempted to break through the South Lake Tahoe stores front door window using a rock - the same method robbers used to break into the Fair Oaks store. However, the individuals were unable to fully break through the reinforced glass and left the scene. Is it just a coincidence? Daniels said. I dont know...I dont think so.

Angelenos calling 911 may find themselves squandering precious life-saving minutes while waiting for someone to pick up the phone and help them, according to an NBC investigative report. Depending on where you are calling from, a call to 9-11 will likely route you to the California Highway Patrol Los Angeles Communications Center, a facility that is understaffed and straining under the constraints of outdated technology, CHP insiders told NBC. According to whistleblowers, callers have had to wait as long as eight minutes to get an emergency dispatcher on the phone while others eventually hang up before a live person ever answers. Somebody is going to die with this equipment we have. Somebody is going to die because we cant get to the calls to answer the calls. Its just a matter of time, said one insider. Good luck. Good luck getting through, one employee told NBC when asked what can happen when calling 911 with an emergency. I know that I signed up for a job to help people and I cant do that right now and it feels awful, said another insider. Officials with the CHP disputed the notion that residents in distress arent getting a 911 dispatcher on the phone in a timely manner, noting that 91 percent of its 911 calls are answered in 15 seconds or less. However, the communications center failed to meet the guidelines for response times set by the National Emergency Number Association and Californias Office of Emergency Services every month in 2016, according to NBC.

The investigation, dubbed Operation Fat Chance, resulted in the seizures of more than three kilograms of heroin, more than a kilogram of cocaine and more than 230 grams of fentanyl, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Illinois. Eight illegal firearms were also seized, including a semi-automatic assault rifle with a drum barrel magazine and more than $100,000 in proceeds from drug sales, prosecutors said. According to the federal complaints, Thomas Barfield, 36, of Chicago, is a reputed street-gang member who operated a drug trafficking organization that used street-level distributors to sell heroin and fentanyl to customers.

276,276,"By JAIMIE CURA (Patch Staff) Former Wesleyan University student Zachary Kramer, 22, of Bethesda, pleaded guilty Thursday in federal court to one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute, and to distribute, MDMA, otherwise known as Molly. The charge stems from an investigation into the distribution of controlled substances that caused multiple students at the Connecticut college to overdose in February of this year, according to Deirdre M. Daly, United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut. The Purchase and Re-Selling of Molly According to court documents and statements made in court, in approximately September 2014, Kramer, who was a student at Wesleyan in Middletown, Conn., began purchasing and reselling a substance he knew as Molly and which he believed to be ecstasy or MDMA, a Schedule I controlled substance. After obtaining bulk quantities of the drug from another student, Kramer sold it in smaller quantities to students at Wesleyan. Related The Primary Supplier of Molly In approximately December 2014, Kramer became the primary supplier of MDMA at Wesleyan. He would typically sell the MDMA in 0.1 gram quantities for $20 each or he would sell it in 5-gram and 10-gram quantities for a discount, charging $100 or more, depending on the customer and the quantity, according to court documents. During this time period, Kramer was still supplied by the same individual who provided him the MDMA in bulk quantities. In approximately January 2015, Kramer purchased about 45 grams of MDMA from this supplier. He broke that quantity into five and 10-gram bags and distributed those bags to other students who planned to break down the MDMA into 0.1 gram capsules, sell those capsules to other Wesleyan students, and pay Kramer for the quantity of the drug he had provided to them, Daly said in a prepared statement. 11 People Overdosed; One Died and Was Revived On Feb. 21, 11 people, including 10 Wesleyan students, overdosed on a substance they believed was MDMA, and many were taken to the hospital. Two of the students were in critical condition, and one of the students had to be revived after his heart stopped. Eleven of these students obtained the purported MDMA through individual distributers who were supplied directly by Kramer, according to Daly. Although Kramer and some of his distributers destroyed the substance identified as Molly that they had in their possession, one of the distributers did not, and that substance was seized by law enforcement officers and sent to the toxicology laboratory for testing. Laboratory analysis confirmed that the powdered substance contained AB Fubinaca, a Schedule I controlled substance. Maximum 20-Year Prison Term; Max Fine of $1 Million The charge of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute, and to distribute, MDMA carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years and a maximum fine of $1 million. Kramer is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Vanessa L. Bryant on February 10, 2016, in Hartford. He has been released on bond since his federal arrest on May 22, 2015.

Philip Gingerella, at about 9:14 p.m. on Dec. 27 they received a 911 call from a man at a home on Lauri Drive. The man told police that his 16-year-old son had been walking to Rippys Liquor and Marketplace when he had been hit by a car. Police said the boy was conscious but suffering from severe injuries, and he was transported to a local hospital for treatment. Charlestown police issued a bulletin to state police and local departments to look for a car with front-end damage consistent with a hit-and-run. According to Rhode Island State Police, about 15 minutes after the bulletin they stopped a car driven by Wright on Route 4 in East Greenwich for suspicion of drunken driving. Police said they have received several calls complaining of Wright driving erratically. State police said that when interviewing Wright, she believed that she was on her way home to North Stonington after attending a party on Holly Ridge Road in South Kingstown.

285,285,"Attorney General Christopher Porrino and the Office of Insurance Fraud Prosecutor announced Monday that a Newark pediatrician has been sentenced to three years in state prison for submitting fraudulent claims to the Medicaid program through which she falsely billed for working 24 hours or more a day. According to prosecutors, Ibilola Ighama-Amegor, 55, whose Quality Pediatrix practice is located in Newark, must also pay $216,000 in restitution under a sentence issued by Superior Court Judge Michael Petrolle in Newark on Friday. Following a five-week jury trial in June, a jury found Amegor guilty of 48 counts of health care claims fraud and one count of Medicaid fraud, all in the third degree. Amegor was acquitted of second-degree theft by deception, prosecutors said. At trial, the state presented testimony that Amegor submitted bills for 24 hours or more of work on 48 dates of service between April 30, 2008 and May 16, 2011. An investigation by the Office of the Insurance Fraud Prosecutor determined that Amegors practice was only open for approximately eight hours per day, three days a week. Dr. Amegor used her medical degree as a license to steal from a program that pays for medical care for the elderly and those who cant afford health insurance, Porrino stated.

307,307,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA—The prosecution and defense delivered closing arguments Saturday afternoon in the George Huguely murder trial. The 24-year-old Chevy Chase man is accused in the May 2010 murder of his ex-girlfriend, Yeardley Love of Cockeysville. The defense rested its case at around 2 p.m., with Huguely waiving his right to testify. Visibly emotional, prosecutor Dave Chapman broke down in tears a few times during his closing statement to the jury. It goes without saying this woman will never be able to tell you what happened to her, Chapman said. He began his argument attempting to show that Huguely was acting maliciously when he sent Love an email stating I should have killed you. Proving malice is necessary to prosecute for first-degree murder in Virginia. What are all the escalations you have to go through before you say, I should kill you? Chapman said. Thats a violent statement. Chapman furthered argued that holding Love against her will showed disregard for the life of another. He said Huguely gesticulated the motions of the couples altercation prior to her death—including mimicking her shrinking into a corner to get away from him—during questioning. Imagine what it was like in real time under the circumstances, he said. Defense attorney Francis McQ. Lawrence said that he also believes Huguely did contribute to Loves death, but it was ultimately the combination of alcohol and the injuries sustained in the altercation that led to her death. Lawrence then alleged that the prosecution was overzealous in its case, stating that Huguely and Love didnt have a healthy relationship but it wasnt a turbulent, violent one. A 117-pound woman is a force to be reckoned with, he said. Lawrence added that Huguely certainly did not plan to kill Love. There was no intentional killing because he didnt leave her dead when he left her, he said. Instead, Lawrence portrayed his client as a victim of alcohol. We know enough about George to know hes not complicated, he said. Alcohol is ruining his life. Lawrence also blamed the culture of Charlottesvilles mens and womens lacrosse ghetto, where drama and infidelities are commonplace among young adults. Youve seen a lot of attractive people come [through the courthouse], he said. Thats what these kids do. The jury will begin deliberations on Wednesday at 9 a.m.",0,8,5

328,328,"Los Angeles City firefighters, along with personnel from the Los Angeles County and Ventura County fire departments, have achieved full containment of a stubborn brush fire Sunday that scorched nearly nine acres in Chatsworth close to the Ronald Reagan (118) Freeway that left one person seriously injured, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. The blaze broke out around 5:10 p.m. near 23000 W. Susana Pass Road and burned east of Rocky Peak Road between the 118 Freeway and Santa Susana Pass Road, LAFD spokesman Brian Humphrey said. The exact area burned was determined to be 8.64 acres, Humphrey added. The cause of the fire was found to be a passenger car that tumbled off Santa Susana Pass Road, toppling a power pole and downing electrical wires before the vehicle caught fire, Humphrey said. The man driving the car managed to climb out of the burning vehicle, make his way up a hill and flag down a passing Los Angeles police car. The man suffered second- and third-degree burns to his hands, arms and legs. Paramedics took the man to a hospital in serious condition, Humphrey said. The wires remain electrified and down alongside Santa Susana Pass Road between Rocky Peak and Iverson roads, Humphrey said. People should avoid contact with downed wires in that area. Along with ground personnel, the LAFD sent three water-dropping helicopters to the fight. The county fire department dispatched two water-dropping copters and two fixed-wing tankers to the site, Humphrey said. All air resources were released from the fight around 7 p.m., he said. The fire caused the temporary shutdown of the eastbound 118 Freeway between Rocky Peak and Topanga Canyon by the California Highway Patrol. The CHP also shut down the westbound offramp at Rocky Peak Road. All westbound lanes are open, Humphrey said. Just after 7 p.m., the CHP opened the eastbound 118 carpool and 1 and 2 lanes. The right lane of the 118 will remain shut down until at least 10 p.m. for fire suppression operations, but traffic through the area was snarled, according to the CHP. No additional injuries were reported so far. No structures have been threatened and no evacuations have been ordered.

340,340,"Carrie Smiths voice, recorded two months before her death, was filled with terror. Please come quick, I was robbed, the Wilson grandmother told the 911 operator in a tape played Wednesday at a preliminary hearing for one of the accused robbers. They made me open my safe. Please help me before they come back. Police showed up within minutes, but prosecutors say the damage was done. They say stress of the gunpoint robbery caused Smith to suffer a heart attack, which caused her health to decline until . Her death was ruled a homicide. And now, one of those accused robbers—30-year-old Rogel Suero of Allentown—is headed to trial for allegedly robbing, threatening, assaulting and ultimately killing the 76-year-old Smith. District Judge Richard Yetter ruled Wednesday there was enough evidence for the case against Suero to go to Northampton County Court. He made his ruling after hearing testimony from police, the county coroner, the man accused of driving Suero from the robbery, and from Smith herself, in her terrified 911 call. The call came in early on the morning of Jan. 15, 2012, after Suero and another man—whom police have yet to identify—allegedly burglarized Smiths home on Hillside Avenue. Police say Smiths granddaughter, Rebecca Johnson, helped plan the robbery with Suero, giving them a key to the house and getting her brother, who lived with Smith, out of the home. Johnson, 28, is also facing a criminal homicide charge and is in Northampton County Prison. Once inside the house, police say, Suero and the other man put a pillow over Smiths face and made her open a safe, giving them access to $40,000 in cash and jewelry. Johnson and Suero allegedly wanted the money to travel to Colorado for a drug deal. Suero and Johnson had attempted to rob the house two weeks earlier, according to testimony from David Bechtold, Johnsons cousin and the man who allegedly drove Suero from the Jan. 15 robbery. Bechtold, 18, testified that he and Suero were going to simply carry Smiths safe out of the house. But they called this off when they realized Smith was home. Two weeks later, Bechtold said, the plan changed: Johnson would get her brother out of the house, and Suero and another man—who Bechtold knew as Avon—would go into the house. The robbery took five minutes, said Bechtold, who testified he was later paid $1,000 for his help. He is facing robbery charges and is in county prison. After the men left, Smith called 911. She couldnt identify the men, but knew one thing: Theyd known she had a safe. Im afraid theyre going to come back, she told the operator. One of them had a gun, she said. He had threatened her: If you holler, Im going to put this to your head and shoot you. Defense attorney Phil Lauer argued that there was no way to show that Suero did any of these things. He also told the judge that Smith had a litany of medical conditions before the robbery that could have contributed to her death. Assistant District Attorney Patricia Mulqueen said Suero acted as an accomplice in the robbery, and was therefore guilty even if he hadnt taken actually assaulted or threated Smith. Yetter agreed, and bound all charges against Suero over for trial. Sueros formal arraignment is scheduled for June 20.",0,8,5

Its one of the best choices I made in a long time for myself, said graduate Jennifer Johnson, whose father flew 10 hours to see the ceremony. She and her classmates wore paper mortarboards that theyd designed for the ceremony, which marked the end of a four-month class designed to reduce recidivism by helping the women re-enter society. The prisons male inmates have had their own version of the program -- its called Future Foundations -- since 2008, said Sherry Darr, one of Sister to Sisters counselors. Prisons are emphasizing rehabilitation as they become more overcrowded, Darr said. The program involves whats known as cognitive behavior therapy -- trying to get the residents to identify errors in thinking that lead to criminal addictive behavior, she said. Wednesdays graduates have different futures ahead of them, Darr said. Some will be released, some will go on parole or probation, some will enter the county work release program, and some will still have to serve sentences in state prisons, where -- with luck -- versions of this program will be in place. Speaker after speaker told the graduates and their families the ceremony represents the beginning -- rather than the end -- of a lot of hard work. You need to get behind them, and help them, said deputy warden Michael Bateman, who helped bring the program to the prison. He was elated to see Wednesdays graduates.This is like the first day of spring for me.",0,8,5

Narcan is an opioid receptor blocker which, when administered quickly, will result in temporarily reversing the overdose. Its widely used by medical emergency personnel across the country with great success and law enforcement agencies are starting to deploy the antidote to its uniform officers. Reversing the overdose will allow time for more advanced treatment to the patient, the agency said.",0,8,5

Nathan Beran, his wife Melanie and his sister Jennifer in February filed suit in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh against the police department, four of its officers, the Northern Regional Joint Police Board and . A court document filed Tuesday shows the case was not resolved in a mediation session held Monday. Mediator David B. White said he is not permitted to comment on the case. Since the February filing, the police department and Richland Township have been dismissed from the suit. The remaining defendants are the joint police board and the four officers -- Paul Hughes, Regis Welsh, Matthew Durzo and Charles Seibert. The board is an advisory agency that includes representatives from the communities served by the police department --  Marshall, Bradford Woods and In April, 10 of the 33 counts in the lawsuit were dismissed. In the case of Nathan Beran, the defendants are accused of battery, assault, tolerating the use of excessive force and violating his constitutional rights. Police also arrested Nathans sister Jennifer after the confrontation, according to the lawsuit. On her behalf, the lawsuit alleges false arrest and imprisonment, battery, assault, using excessive force and violating her constitutional rights. Nathans wife, Melanie, alleges the loss of consortium in the lawsuit. The lawsuit stems from a Feb.11, 2009, incident in which police were called to the Richland Township home of Berans mother, Vivian Beran, at 3923 Gibsonia Road (Route 910). Police charged Beran with four counts of aggravated assault, one count of disarming a law enforcement officer, six counts of reckless endangerment and one count of criminal mischief/damaging property after encountering him there. In October he was found not guilty of the five felony counts of aggravated assault and disarming a law enforcement officer. He was found guilty of misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment and criminal mischief/property damage. Common Pleas Judge Jeffrey A. Manning in January sentenced him to four years of probation and to undergo treatment. He also was ordered to pay court costs of $2,562. The Berans lawsuit states that Vivian Beran called 911 after Nathan became upset and broke several windows. She told the operator that her son had shot out a window, was agitated, had been drinking and was banging stuff in her house, and that her daughter was trying to talk to Nathan, according to court documents. Vivian Beran spoke to the 911 operator a second time, saying her son did not shoot out any windows and that he had broken the rifle he had with him, according to the lawsuit.  She said the rifle was in her back yard, the lawsuit states. Once the police arrived at the Beran home, Nathans mother and sister assured them that Nathan had calmed down and their services were no longer needed, according to the lawsuit. His mother told the officers her son needed psychiatric help, the lawsuit states. The police did not leave, however, and they searched the house for Nathan with his sister Jennifer leading the way into each room, according to the lawsuit. After getting Nathan to leave the basement bathroom, police shocked him with a Taser and shot him, according to the suit. He was transported by ambulance to Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh and later taken to the Allegheny County Jail.

This is what Ammoland found out: We were shocked to find that 64% of the FFL holders are home based. California was at 49%, New Jersey at 51% and even Massachusetts at 42%…. Sellers and buyers say theyre in a free market exercising their Second Amendment rights, worried that the federal government has grown more hostile to guns, according to the reports. Gun control advocates, however, say its a concern in New Jerseys densely populated neighborhoods where residents are often unaware of guns shops almost hidden inside common suburban homes near churches, schools and stores. For example: Atlantic Tactical, located in a strip mall on Worlds Fair Drive in Somerset, has three men in identical store-branded polos who sell handguns in glass display cases. But if you dont like what they have there, you can go just seven miles down the road through Somerset County, where youll be greeted by the president and vice president of the company, according to the nj.com report. And not everybody is doing it legally. In July, a N.J. man was sentenced to 120 months in prison for selling 33 firearms to a confidential informant, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. Bernardo Guzman, 26, of Jersey City previously pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Madeline Cox Arleo to an information charging him with one count of possessing firearms while being a previously convicted felon. According to court documents and statements, Guzman admitted that on Nov. 14, 2013, he met with an individual in the parking lot of a grocery store in Fort Lee to illegally sell three handguns. Guzman also admitted that from June 2013 through February 2014, he sold approximately 33 firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition to a confidential informant. The firearms sold by Guzman consisted of semiautomatic weapons, sawed-off shotguns, assault-style rifles and firearms with high-capacity magazines. Some of the firearms had obliterated serial numbers. All of the weapons and ammunition are now in the custody of law enforcement. In addition to the prison term, a federal judge sentenced Guzman to serve three years of supervised release.",0,8,5

382,382,"A state appeals court in San Francisco on Tuesday upheld a jurys determination that a 14-year-old Pleasanton girl was murdered in 1984 by a then-16-year-old fellow high school student. But the Court of Appeal reduced the conviction of Steven Carlson, now 48, from first-degree murder to second-degree murder and ordered a resentencing. Tina Faelz, a freshman at Foothill High School, was killed with 44 stab wounds when on her way home from school on the afternoon of April 5, 1984. Her body was found in a drainage ditch adjacent to Interstate Highway 680, east of the high school. Carlson lived nearby on Lemonwood Way For a map showing the area, click here. The case was cold for more than two decades, but in 2011, authorities announced that DNA investigations begun in 2007 linked a spot of blood found on Faelzs purse, which was found hanging from a tree at the homicide scene, to Carlson. Carlson, who then had a criminal record that included convictions for drug crimes and a lewd act on a 13-year-old girl, was arrested and charged with the murder. He was tried as an adult. An Alameda County Superior Court convicted Carlson of first-degree murder in 2014. He was sentenced to 26 years to life in prison. Unless Carlson successfully appeals to the California Supreme Court, the case will now go back to Superior Court for resentencing for second-degree murder, which carries a possible term of 15 years to life in prison. In its ruling on Carlsons appeal, a three-judge Court of Appeal panel said the conviction must be reduced to second-degree murder because prosecutors hadnt proved the element of premeditation and deliberate intent needed for a first-degree murder conviction. The panel said prosecutors main argument for premeditation was the number of the stab wounds, but noted the California Supreme court has said that brutality alone is not proof of premeditation. It quoted a 1968 high court decision that said, It is well established that the brutality of a killing cannot in itself support a finding that the killer acted with premeditation and deliberation. Unless there is other evidence of premeditation, a brutal killing is as consistent with a sudden, random explosion of violence as with calculated murder, the high court said in another ruling cited by the appeals court. The panel rejected several other claims in Carlsons appeal, including his argument that the jury should not have been shown portions of a videotaped jailhouse interview of Carlson by two detectives in 2011. Carlson was serving a drug sentence at Santa Cruz County Jail at the time. The victims mother, Shirley Faelz Orosco, died unexpectedly on Feb. 13, 2014 — the same day the murder trial was scheduled to begin. Karen Reiff, Oroscos sister, believes she finally succumbed to the sadness of her daughters death. My sister went through almost 30 years of hell after Tinas death, and I think she finally died of a broken heart, Reiff said in a previous Patch article. The photos of Shirley with Tina show how happy she [Shirley] was before someone came and ruined her life. I looked at them and thought, How dare someone come and take a person from their mother, brother and family and kill them? I mean, how dare they! I wish no other family in the world ever have to go through this. I truly do feel that if Tina had not been murdered, Shirley would be alive now. Thirty years of the stress and pain finally killed her. The murderer should be up for two murders as far as Im concerned. Reiff says Orosco was never the same after Faelzs death. After Tina was murdered, it all fell apart for Shirley, Reiff said. She couldnt take it anymore. Who could? And she never got resolution! At least Shirley and Tina are together now in heaven and pain-free. You will always be in our hearts and memories and always loved. The Faelz family did not comment about the ruling.

383,383,"East Haven Police on Wednesday released a video of the Old Stone Church Pastor confronting officers and trying to block them from taking an accused violent offender, who hid inside the church, back to police headquarters for processing Tuesday afternoon. Police also released body camera footage late Wednesday, which shows police searching the church for the accused violent offender. (You can view both videos a bit further down in the story). Police said the Pastor was extremely irate that police officers entered her church to search for a violent fugitive, Ryan Champlin, 34, who had just attacked his mother repeatedly with a telephone in their home Tuesday. The Pastor physically attempted to stop police officers from leaving with the accused including jumping in front of the police car, police said. The Pastor demanded that police release the accused to her. On the video, the Pastor blasts cops and said they had no authority to arrest the accused and could not go inside the church to search for the accused violent offender. She said police cant arrest the man while he is inside the church because its a sanctuary. Police said young children may have been inside the church, which operates a daycare, and they needed to act. Police were able to take Champlin into custody Tuesday afternoon despite the Pastors vehement objections. The victim suffered serious but non-life-threatening injuries during the brutal attack, police said. Police Lt. Joseph M. Murgo said they respect the rights of the church but felt they needed to act, especially with young children possibly nearby. Other church employees did allow police into the building, Murgo said, and it was only after Champlin was in custody did the Pastor come on scene. While the East Haven Police Department respects the sanctity of a church, we also owe it to victims of domestic violence to apprehend suspects who commit violent felony assaults, Murgo said. Officers were also cognizant of the fact that children attending day care might have been exposed to a fleeing felony suspect within the interior of the church. We feel that the decision to enter the church was the correct one in this particular situation. Here is video of the officers searching for Champlin. Police said they responded to a local home on a report of a serious domestic violence assault Tuesday afternoon. When officers arrived they found the mans mother badly beaten, police said. The victim said she got into an argument with her son because he does not pay to live with them, police said. The victim said while she was being assaulted by her son, she attempted to call 911, but was unable to do so because Champlin pushed her to the ground, police said. The victim ran into her bedroom and locked the door, but Champlin forced his way in by kicking it open, grabbed the cordless phone from her and struck her in the back of the head with it several times, breaking the phone, Murgo said. He then fled on foot. Officers received a tip that Champlin had been dropped off at the Old Stone Church, 251 Main Street, and police were initially allowed in by church employees to search for the man, police said. Champlin was found hiding in an upstairs office and was arrested without incident, police said. Police said the Pastor arrived and blocked in the police cruiser that Champlin was in and demanded that officers release him to her custody. She said officers had no right to arrest him within the interior of the church, even if it was for felony domestic violence charges, police said. The Pastor, who was extremely irate, proceeded to attempt to get in front of the police cruiser when an officer attempted to drive away with Champlin, but was stopped by another officer on scene. During this (incident), officers exercised excellent discretion and de-escalated the situation, Murgo said. Police said when Champlin entered the church he had access to the whole building including the daycare area. Police said they dont believe he contacted any children. Champlin is charged with second-degree assault, interfering with an emergency call, disorderly conduct, and third-degree criminal mischief. He is being held in lieu of a $25,000 bond.

390,390,"The husband and wife who helped run a national drug trafficking and money laundering organization through the now closed KC Pit BBQ Restaurant in Sandy Springs have been sentenced to federal prison. Thousands of kilograms of cocaine imported from Mexico was transported from California to Kansas City, Philadelphia and Washington D.C., and millions of dollars in drug proceeds in Georgia were laundered. According to U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates and other information presented in court: In 2003, the Johnsons owned the restaurant.  Jiles Johnson was also a commercial truck driver and began to supplement his income by driving cocaine from California to Philadelphia on behalf of Mark Walker. Walker was a Philadelphia cocaine distributor with access to street-level dealers.  Johnson also supplied cocaine to Kansas City and Washington, D.C. The Johnsons purchased more than $3 million in real estate in Georgia with the drug proceeds, including an 80-acre motorcycle racetrack in Twiggs County. Linda Tong of Alpharetta, a real estate broker, made deposits under $10,000 to avoid the filing of a Currency Transaction Report by a financial institution to help them. Matthew Ware, the restaurants accountant, accepted bags of cash in excess of $10,000 from Jiles Johnson. Ware provided the cash to some of his clients and they repaid him with checks made payable to Johnson and his businesses. Ware connected Johnson to Jacques Degaule to assist with the laundering. The financial planner traveled to banks in Georgia, Missouri, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to deposit more than $7 million dollars. None of the required IRS Forms were filed. Evan Francis, a local car broker, coordinated the delivery of loads of cocaine, solicited customers and deposited cash.  Schawn Lemon Wortham laundered Mark Walkers funds while he remained incarcerated. The cocaine originated from Mexico and was supplied from California by Jose Gastelum and Lorenzo Vargas.  When Johnson experienced financial losses, Gastelum and Vargas took ownership interests in his restaurant and racetrack with Wares assistance. The organization unraveled in 2010 when Thallas Amie, Lavern Simon and Jiles Johnson attempted to deliver 35 kilograms of cocaine to Philadelphia. The cocaine was intercepted by law enforcement. U.S. District Judge Richard W. Story sentenced the Johnsons and other members of the organization, including: Linda Tong, 68, of Alpharetta, entered a guilty plea to one count of Structuring.  On Sept. 4, she was sentenced to three years of probation with the special condition of ten months home detention.",0,8,5

403,403,"Enough cold air will linger across New Jersey during the latter half of January to increase the chance of snow in areas that have received little so far this season. A complex storm could bring snow, ice and rain to New Jersey this weekend, followed by another wave of arctic air will sweep southeastward this weekend, according to an AccuWeather release. With the air starting colder as storms approach, the likelihood of precipitation beginning as snow or a wintry mix in New Jersey will be much greater during the second half of the month than at any point so far this season, AccuWeather says. In the Midwest, this new blast of arctic air will be as cold as that of the start of this week, but for much of the Northeast it will be coldest of the season so far, According to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson says in the release. The storm system that is expected to take shape this weekend could saturate New Jersey with rain, starting out and end as a sloppy mix of rain, sleet and snow, according to nj.com. Forecasters who have been analyzing computer models that keep shifting the location of the expected storm track and the range of temperatures told nj.com that the storm could arrive late Friday night into early Saturday morning. Here is the weekend forecast from the National Weather Service: Friday night: Rain a possibility throughout N.J. at 7 p.m. Sunday morning: Snow could arrive in North Jersey by 1 a.m. Snow could arrive in South Jersey by 7 a.m. Monday morning: Snow could hit Jersey Shore by 1 a.m. Even as the core of the arctic air settles off the coast over the next week or two, meanwhile, enough cold air may remain behind to allow storms that roll along have greater chances at bringing snow or some sort of wintry precipitation when compared to early winter. You dont need bitterly cold air for it to snow, just cold enough, within a few degrees of freezing, AccuWeather Chief Long-Range Meteorologist Paul Pastelok said in the release. We expect temperatures to settle near average during late January in the Midwest and much of the East, which is cold enough for snow. While the exact timing and track of storms, which will determine who gets snow versus rain, can be uncertain several days out, there are indications that the pattern will yield more snow opportunities during late January, according to AccuWeather. If we look at the overall pattern, there is likely to be a major storm or two with a chance at bringing substantial accumulating snow to portions of the Ohio Valley, I-95 corridor of the mid-Atlantic and southern New England during the third and fourth week of the month, Pastelok said. The weight and extent of the cold air could be enough to cause storms to track more to the east and just off the Atlantic coast, instead of northward toward the Great Lakes and Appalachians. With a more southern and eastern storm track, snow could reach areas farther south and east than the first part of the winter. For portions of the Great Lakes, Appalachians and central and northern New England, multiple storms with enough snow and wintry mix to make for slippery travel are likely for the second half of January. This includes cities such as Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Boston and Albany, New York, according to AccuWeather.",0,8,5

Springfield Police said on June 1, a woman tried using a stolen drivers license to withdraw money from a local bank. She is suspected of attempting similar withdraws at other banks around Delaware County, according to police.

Then female members of the gang will pose as those victims at bank drive-throughs to steal funds from victims accounts. The gang uses the outside most lanes of bank drive-throughs so as not to be identified. That lane has since been called the felony lane by law enforcement agencies.

415,415,"Editors Note: The following is a submission by Inver Grove Heights Fire Chief Judy Thill. Do you have what it takes to answer the call?Did you ever dream of becoming a firefighter? Do you know that you can continue working your regular job and still fulfill that dream? The Inver Grove Heights Fire Department (IGHFD) is looking for people interested in becoming a volunteer/paid-on-call firefighter. The majority of our present openings for those available to respond to fire calls during the day. You could be someone who works a second or third shift, a stay-at-home parent or work-from-home employee, or even someone who works rotating shifts.Did you know that the City of Inver Grove Heights is protected by a volunteer/paid-on-call fire department? That means firefighters who respond to emergencies within Inver Grove Heights are not full-time city employees and do not sleep at the fire stations. They have other jobs outside of the fire department. Paid-on-call departments are a new twist to those volunteer ranks. Today, Inver Grove Heights pays their volunteers an hourly wage for emergency calls, training and other department-related activities. Also, at the end of 20 years, there is a lump-sum retirement benefit.The IGHFD responds to many types of emergencies, including house fires, ice rescues, vehicle accidents, water rescues, vehicle fires, hazardous materials incidents, medical calls and many others. In 2010, the IGHFD responded to more than 1,200 emergency calls. The IGHFD also spends time in the community educating the public on fire prevention as well as staying safe from fires and accidents. Members also provide CPR training to the public.Because of the amount of required training, inherent risks of the job, and high cost of training and equipping a firefighter, volunteering in the pure sense has become a thing-of-the-past. So, becoming a firefighter can be a lengthy process. The training IGH firefighters go through is exactly the same as the full-time career firefighters in the big cities. There are strict attendance requirements for both training and emergency call attendance.If interested, the first thing you will need to do is submit an IGHFD application. After a review of your application, you may get called in for an interview. If you make it through the interview process, you are given a conditional job offer, which means you are then required to pass a medical exam, physical ability test, psychological evaluation, drug screen and background check. Although belonging to the IGHFD Department can be lots of fun and very rewarding, it is a serious business and is treated as such.Once those basic hiring requirements are completed, you are required to pass a firefighting course. This is held one day or one night a week, depending on your availability. This course consists of classroom sessions and hands-on activities. Students learn basic firefighting skills, including such things as using ladders, power tools and self-contained breathing equipment. After firefighting school, recruits then begin responding to actual emergencies. However, basic training continues with required courses in hazardous materials, medical first responder, truck driving and fire pump operation—for a total of well over 200 hours of basic firefighting training just to hit the minimum requirements. There are also weekly in-house training sessions required to keep skills current and sharp.Sure, it sounds like a lot—and it is—but the information you learn is interesting, many of the skills can be used outside the fire department, the activities can challenge you both physically and mentally. AND you join one of the largest families around—the fire family! The IGHFD Is also known for its outstanding achievements. In just the past year, two firefighters have been recognized statewide for their achievements and one has been recognized at the county level!Being a firefighter can be very rewarding. Do you want to give something back to the community? Do you like helping others? Do you want to join a family and make a lot of new friends? Do you like to be challenged? Do you have time to share? If you answered yes to all of these questions, we would like to receive your application! There are a couple of ways you can get a copy of the application: downloading it off the City website or calling the IGHFD to mail you one, or stopping by the IGHFD to pick one up in person. Once the application is completed, you can mail or fax it in or drop it off in person.So—if you think you have what it takes to answer the call, especially if you are available most days, we want to hear from you. Applications will be accepted through Oct. 17. The administrative offices phone number is 651-455-5082 and are located at 7015 Clayton Avenue.

Fortunately for two motorists in Clearwater, the sum of their recent actions behind the wheel didnt add up to a crash. The incident in question unfolded recently at the corner of Fort Harrison Avenue and Chestnut Street. A red-light video camera set up at that corner happened to capture two motorists making potentially deadly driving mistakes at the same time. As the traffic light at the intersection turned red, a vehicle blew through the light to continue on Chestnut, a one-way street. At that exact moment, a driver on Fort Harrison decided to make a westbound turn onto Chestnut. The problem with the second drivers decision, the Clearwater Police Department pointed out, is that Chestnut is a one-way street. That one-way happens to run east, not west. The two vehicles nearly collided, but managed to avoid that eventuality. Talk about a recipe for disaster, the police department posted on Facebook along with the video. Thankfully, there was no accident. The red-light runner, however, is likely to get a surprise ticket in the mail as a result of the infraction.

More than a quarter of those people died in drunk-driving crashes that occurred in the early morning, post-party hours. Please enjoy St. Patricks Day in a safe and responsible manner, by not drinking and driving, Reynoso said. Remember it only takes one impaired driver to change the lives of many forever. Reynoso urged people to use a designated driver or other safe methods to get home if they are planning to drink. Also, authorities publicized the Designated Driver VIP -- or DDVIP -- free mobile app for use with Android or iPhone. The app helps find nearby bars and restaurants that feature free incentives for the designated sober driver -- from free non-alcoholic drinks to free appetizers and more. The app also has social media tie-ins and even a tab for the non-DD to call Uber, Lyft or Curb. Authorities urged people to call 911 immediately if they see a dangerous driver.

471,471,"Parents in the Johnston school district can attend a meeting today to help address the recent deaths of two teenage students.The meeting, to be held at 5 p.m. in the Johnston Middle School auditorium, includes a presentation by two experts in loss and grieving, according to the districts website. The experts will provide insights and guidance on how to talk to and support students.Two 15-year-old boys, one a Johnston High School student and one a Johnston Middle School student, died in unrelated cases, authorities said. Cameron Carico, a ninth-grader, died Saturday morning, while Spenser Nelson, a 10th-grader, died on Sunday night.Cyndy Erikson, consultant with the Iowa Department of Education, offered several tips and insight on addressing such a difficult situation with young adults. While Erikson is not one of the experts attending tonights meeting, she has dealt with similar situations. Talking to your kids, she said of dealing with the aftermath of a suicide. Not treating this as a taboo subject that we dont talk about, but really talk about their feelings, how this might be impacting them. Keeping a close eye on them. Keeping tabs on what your child is doing is also very important, especially with social media. Several social media pages have been set up to remember Cameron Carico and Spenser Nelson, including on You Tube and Facebook. I think talking to adults, processing that in a way that is sort of not memorializing or glorifying the incident, Erikson said. Because it causes a lot of hurt and questions that need to be processed. Making sure students have a strong support network is another top priority, she said. The Johnston school district has made counselors available to students at several buildings since Monday morning.  Parents, teachers, and community members should be vigilant in watching for signs of depression following such an event. I dont know that its common, but its certainly something to be concerned about and to watch for, she said of additional suicides. There is always someone to help in the situation that youre going through. To make sure there is someone they feel safe with. Dont treat it like its not urgent, we need to respond immediately.Funeral ArrangementsThe families of both boys have announced visitation and funeral arrangements.A visitation for Cameron will take place at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 1, at Oakwood United Methodist Church, 440 N.E. 56th St. in Pleasant Hill.Funeral services for Cameron will be at 11 a.m. on Thursday, Feb. 2, at Oakwood Methodist Church.The visitation for Spenser will begin at 6 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 2, at Johnston Evangelical Free Church, 9901 N.W. 62nd Ave.Funeral services for Spenser will be held at 10 a.m. on Friday, Feb. 3, at Johnston Evangelical Free Church.In a news release from the school district, students planning to attend the services were asked to notify the school office to arrange for their absence.This is a very difficult time for all of us, but especially the Carico and Nelson families, Superintendent Clay Guthmiller said in the release.

478,478,"Christmastime Traffic on Los Angeles County freeways so far has been akin to a weekend of light congestion and minor traffic crashes, a California Highway Patrol officer said Thursday. There is some slow down in certain areas, but for the most part, we dont have any major delays, CHP Officer Peter Bishop said. I think its like a weekend, in general. Any signs of potential congestion, Bishop said, was likely to occur on the Golden State (5) Freeway, south of the Ventura (101) Freeway, where motorists are heading up north to Castaic, Santa Barbara or Northern California. If you take the 5, south of the 101, youre going to have some delays, Bishop said. Its typical L.A. traffic. What has been a surprise are motorists heading in other directions -- notably Las Vegas and San Diego -- are not experiencing significant traffic problems, particularly on the troublesome San Diego (405) Freeway. Im looking at the 405 right nowand (motorists) can expect some delay, but I dont expect any major delays, she said. Its been a fair day so far -- but that could change. Its almost like a Sunday. Its (traffic) fairly light. The Maximum Enforcement Period begins Thursday at 6 p.m. and concludes at midnight Sunday, Sgt. Melissa Hammond of the California Highway Patrol said. You can expect the maximum number of officers deployed in the field looking for intoxicated drivers and primary collision factors such as speeding, following too closely and unsafe lane changes, Hammond said. During the holiday, you want to appoint a designated driver. Being a little tipsy is still considered intoxicated, she said And were expecting rain over the weekend.

Witnesses said Disario had shot and killed victim, David James Armstrong, 56, at the homes garage and was also shooting a gun in the street which lead to a standoff with two deputies, Nick Carmack and Michael Sudler. The deputies involved in the standoff are on administrative leave, as standard protocol, the sheriffs office said. The sheriffs office said Disario had a Core 15 CXV AR-15 rifle and an unknown make/model .22 caliber rifle. There were no markings on the .22 rifle to help identify it, deputies said. It is not known how how he obtained the firearms, but the sheriffs office is working with ATF to see if any more information can be obtained. Disario had a history of mental illness and collected guns, Sheriff Chris Nocco said at a press conference last week. Before the shootout with deputies, Disario shot Armstrong who he believed was messing with his girlfriend. Nocco said that, in reality, Disario does not have a girlfriend. Armstrong was a friend of Disarios mother. Deputies closed down part of State Road 52 near Meadow Drive after reports of the shooting in the Gulf Highlands subdivision. Nocco said Desario was in the middle of the street when deputies exchanged gunfire with him. Disario eventually ran into his house. Deputies followed and found the shooting victim, who had died.

493,493,"Surrounding communities have passed spice or synthetic marijuana bans and now Gulfport is moving forward with a similar law. Council unanimously voted, during first reading Tuesday, to pass the ban. The proposed ordinance is modeled after bans in Pasco County and St. Petersburg. According to the council agenda, those cities are reporting reductions in the sale and use of these substances. During Tuesday nights council meeting Gulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent explained that Gulfports ordinance is aimed at stopping the sale of synthetic drugs. The proposed regulation applies to characteristics of bath salts and illicit synthetic drugs, such as street names and packaging. Vincent explained that the wording included in the ban would allow officers to immediately seize substances and enforce the ban at point of sale. Basically the ban focuses on how its packaged and how its sold. The reason for this is that once state and local lawmakers pass a ban on a substance based on chemical mixture, those making the synthetic drugs change the mixtures again to make them legal. Vincent explained that the wording in this ordinance would help them stop the synthetic drugs from being sold in Gulfport. During Tuesday nights meeting Vincent and City Manager Jim OReilly explained that several local businesses have voluntarily handed over these products. They have been more than cooperative, OReilly said. Council will vote during second reading at a future meeting. If its passed, the ban takes affect immediately.

It also said: We determine an appropriate threshold for each state and only report on cities with populations above this number, SafeWise said. That number is based on the states whole population and the number of cities to be included in the list. Here are the top 25 safest cities in California, according to SafeWise: Each citys safety score is calculated based on information on violent crimes, including aggravated assault, forcible rape, murder and robbery, as well as property crimes, such as arson, burglary, larceny-theft and motor vehicle theft.  Heres the safety formula: (Violent Crimes/(Population/1,000)) + (Property Crimes/(Population/1,000))/2 = Safety Score. With these reports, we have put ourselves into our readers shoes in order to understand what makes us all feel safe or unsafe in a city.

The intersection of Joppa Road at US 40/Pulaski Highway was shut down for several hours as authorities investigated the deadly collision. Thomas Edward Jarvis Sr., 41, was pronounced deceased at the scene on US 40 at Joppa Road, police said. Jarvis had been driving his gray 2000 Jeep Cherokee through the intersection at 1:36 p.m. when a blue truck allegedly ran a red light and hit his drivers side door, according to Maryland State Police. First responders used the jaws of life to free the drivers, who were trapped, and a medevac was requested to the scene, the Joppa-Magnolia Volunteer Fire Company reported at 1:45 p.m. One person was critically injured, while another was in grave condition, the fire company reported. Although Jarvis was wearing a seatbelt, police said he did not survive the crash. The driver of the blue 2001 International 4700 was identified as Joshua Moran, 39.

496,496,"Officer William Porter will have to testify in the trials of five fellow members of the Baltimore Police Department in connection with the death of Freddie Gray. The Maryland Court of Appeals has been considering arguments from both sides—the states attorney saying Porter was a witness in the case and Porters lawyer arguing he is facing his own trial and may exercise his Fifth Amendment right. Porter was the first of six officers charged in Grays death to go to trial, and when the jury could not reach consensus, the judge declared a mistrial in December. Porters new trial date is set for June. The other trials were stayed pending a ruling on whether Porter could be compelled to testify. The Maryland Court of Appeals issued several orders Tuesday, one stating Porter would have to testify in the trials of three officers and another upholding the ruling by a Baltimore judge that he would also have to testify in two others. The order said that the stay was lifted on the pending trials. New dates have not yet been announced. Six Baltimore Police officers are charged in the death of Gray, a 25-year-old who was arrested in April 2015 and died a week later in police custody. After Grays funeral in late April, riots erupted in parts of Baltimore, requiring the National Guard to help quell the unrest. Days later, States Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced charges against six officers. In addition to Porter, Officer Caesar Goodson, Sgt. Alicia White, Officer Garrett Miller, Officer Edward Nero and Lt. Brian Rice face trial for various charges ranging from misconduct to murder. The state has granted Porter immunity for his testimony in the trials of the other officers, meaning that what he says cannot be used against him, according to The Baltimore Sun, which reported it is uncertain whether Porters lawyers will take the appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.",0,8,5

Though Monday’s attack appears to fit scholarly and legal definitions for terrorism, past incidents have been called hate crimes or attributed to disturbed loners with far-right leanings but no real agenda.

7,7,"This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We end the show in Minnesota. Governor Mark Dayton has condemned as terrorism Saturday’s attack on the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, the largest mosque in Minnesota. The explosive device was thrown through the mosque office’s windows around 5:00 a.m. as people were gathering for morning prayers. No one was injured, but the bombing shattered windows and damaged the office. This is Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton. GOV. MARK DAYTON: What a terrible, dastardly, cowardly, terrible act this was that was committed yesterday. It’s a crime. As somebody said in a meeting, if this—the roles were reversed, it would be called a terrorist attack. And that’s what it is. It’s an act of terrorism. AMY GOODMAN: The FBI has taken over the investigation, but so far President Trump has not said or tweeted a word about the attack. Since the attack occurred on Saturday, Trump has sent out over 25 tweets, but not one about the mosque attack. Islamophobic attacks against Muslims and mosques across the United States have been rising since President Trump was elected. Minnesota is home to the nation’s largest Somali-American community, which has faced a surge of hate crimes to levels not seen since the aftermath of 9/11. While overall hate crimes reported by Minnesota law enforcement agencies dropped by 25 percent since 2010, crimes against Muslims have continued an upward trend. To talk more about the attack, we go to Minneapolis, where we’re joined by Mohamed Omar. He’s executive director of the Dar Al-Farooq Center. He was in the mosque when the attack occurred on Saturday morning, thankfully not in his office. We welcome you to Democracy Now! Can you talk about what happened Saturday morning, Mohamed Omar? MOHAMED OMAR: Yeah. Saturday morning, about 5:00 a.m., when we were preparing to go to first prayer, which is called—in Islam, called prayer of Fajr, one of our worshipers was walking from outside, coming into the building, and he saw a pickup truck standing next to our imam’s office window. And he heard a splash, and then when—you know, a sound of like a broken window. He ran to the scene, and immediately, the truck and the driver, they fled—he fled from the scene while he was speeding in his truck. Then he saw smoke coming from the window, and he ran to the inside to the building, came to inform us there’s a smoke coming from the window. As he was speaking, an explosion, very loud explosion, happened, that I was next—I was in the building. I thought like the whole building almost collapsed or something huge happened. So, we all came out. We ran out, you know, outside and saw this huge, you know, shatter of glass and smoke coming out from this window. This is the—this is the room—this is the office of our imam. And immediately we contacted with 911. And thank God, the damage—nobody was hurt. But again, the event was awful, and it was—I mean, I never imagined that we will be bombed in the middle of—in the heart of Bloomington, where we every day come for our prayer. And again, this is our community center, our mosque. This is our youth and family center. So, that was—that was very sad, I mean, to experience that experience. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And about how many people were in the vicinity at the time? Also, have you—has your mosque received any other threats recently that would give you cause to think that somebody might want to harm the worshipers of the mosque? MOHAMED OMAR: I would say, you know, we received some phone calls that—in the past, that’s shown some people that, you know, are using bad language or kind of uncomfortable with us, or they’re talking to us in a very bad way, but not really threats that I could consider, you know, that people would say, “We’ll come and kill you or do this to you.” But again, I mean, this—for the last election season in Minnesota, you know, we’ve seen many incidents and many acts that, you know, similarly, are incited by either hate crime, or you could tell that discriminatory statements towards maybe—I mean, some of the people walk in the middle of night and say something to one of the worshipers, or one of the worshipers was walking by, and he experienced a high-speeding car next to him and then saying bad language. But yet, I mean, we have seen a lot since, I mean, the last election, but not specifically something that I could say—we’d report to the police and say, you know, this is a threat, directly a threat, that we can consider as a— AMY GOODMAN: Mohamed—Mohamed Omar, I wanted to go back to just before Election Day, then the candidate Donald Trump railing against Somali immigrants. This is what he said. DONALD TRUMP: Here in Minnesota, you’ve seen firsthand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state, without your knowledge, without your support or approval, and with some of them then joining ISIS and spreading their extremist views all over our country and all over the world. Honestly, it’s hard to believe. It’s hard to believe. And everybody’s reading about the disaster taking place in Minnesota. Everybody’s reading about it. You don’t even have the right to talk about it. You don’t even know who’s coming in. You have no idea. AMY GOODMAN: That was President Trump on the week of the election, but before he was elected. Mohamed Omar, we just have 20 seconds. He has not tweeted a word about what your governor has called this terrorist attack on your mosque. Your response to President Trump? MOHAMED OMAR: OK, again, this campaign or that rally happened like five miles away from our center. I mean, just let—let me make, you know, very clear. Our mosque is located in Bloomington. And the airport, Minneapolis-St. Paul airport, is located like five miles away from our center. AMY GOODMAN: We have 10 seconds. MOHAMED OMAR: So, when this—yeah, OK. When this happened, I mean, would say that is—I mean, that’s what most of the ignorant people would—you know, would take—see that as something that they can— AMY GOODMAN: We have to leave it there.

The rally gained international attention when James Alex Fields, Jr. plowed into a group of people protesting the Unite the Right rally. One woman was killed and dozens were injured. Fields faces state murder charges in Virginia. The violence was sparked after hundreds of people, some carrying white nationalist symbols and Confederate flags descended on Charlottesville to protest plans to remove a statue honoring a Confederate commander. A clash between the protesters and counter-protesters forced Charlottesville authorities to declare a curfew. “Today’s indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. At the time, U.S. President Donald Trump was condemned by both Democratic and Republican politicians after he said blame for the violence rested on “many sides.” (Reporting by Makini Brice; Editing by G Crosse and JS Benkoe)",1,0,0

USA TODAY Sports Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James at a press conference after Game 1 of the NBA Finals. (Photo: Kelley L Cox, USA TODAY Sports) President Trump’s press secretary Sean Spicer reacted to a request for comment about the racist attack on LeBron James’ home by denying that such incidents have increased since Trump’s election victory. During Spicer’s Friday media briefing reporter April Ryan, White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, highlighted the abusive slogan painted on James’ Los Angeles property that according to police took place in the early hours of Wednesday morning. “I would respectfully disagree with the premise of that,” Spicer said, when quizzed about the perception that racially motivated problems had been exacerbated over the period of Trump’s presidency. “I think we need to denounce hate in any form and any act and this president made it clear from election night to inauguration that he wants to unite this country moving forward.” MORE: However, television personality Star Jones, president of the Professional Diversity Network — which seeks to increase career opportunities for minorities — drew a direct line between the troubling incident that affected Cleveland Cavaliers star James on the eve of the NBA Finals and Trump’s rhetoric. “What once people only thought and were afraid to say, with this president making it OK to come out from underneath your hood, that’s what we are going to get,” Jones said of the James situation, in an interview with CNN. “When the president of the United States sort of appeals to a white nationalist agenda and embraces people who were fearful of the browning of America, and to all practical purposes clung with their dying fingers to white male privilege, yeah, he made it OK.” James spoke candidly and passionately about racism hours after the attack at the house, where he, his wife and his three children spend much of their time during the NBA offseason. “No matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, being black in America is tough,” James said. “We have got a long way to go as a society and for us as African Americans, until we feel equal in America.”",1,0,2
19,19,"On July 28, 2017, John Michael Ready, a 26-year old male with no fixed address, pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of simple assault in which he selected his victim based on the victim’s race. The Alexandria General District Court sentenced him to 12 months in jail with 9 months suspended conditioned on 1 year of supervised probation, 2 years of uniform good behavior, and his having no contact with the victim in this case. By code, the charge carries a 30-day mandatory minimum sentence. The evidence showed that on June 14, 2017, Mr. Ready pulled up next to the victim, an African-American man, at a traffic light on Jefferson Davis Highway. He motioned for the victim to roll his window down. When the victim complied, Ready used a racial slur toward the victim. The victim rolled up his window and attempted to pull into the Potomac Yards shopping center as he had originally planned. Ready also pulled into the parking lot and parked his vehicle. After Ready parked, the victim observed him retrieve a black baseball bat from his trunk. Ready saw the victim and began chasing after his vehicle with the baseball bat. A witness confirmed that Ready was a few feet from the victim’s car and was attempting to strike at it with the bat. The victim eluded Ready until police arrived on scene and was not actually struck or injured during the attack. Alexandria police responded to the parking lot and detained Ready. While officers spoke with him about the incident, Ready continued to make derogatory remarks about African-Americans. Ready later admitted that the incident was racially motivated. This case was prosecuted by Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney Joseph C. Martin. Commonwealth’s Attorney Bryan Porter said: “The Code of Virginia punishes assaults motivated by hate more severely – and for good reason. In addition to the obvious risk of physical harm present during an assault, hate-motivated crimes also tend to divide the citizenry by causing segments of society to fear attack simply because of the race or religious group to which they happen to belong. Hate-motivated crimes directly contravene the aspirational words of the founders of our country – that all citizens are created equal and are entitled to equal protection under the law.” “Proving, in court, that the victim of an assault was selected because of his race or religion can be difficult. Here, the defendant’s own words established the motivation for the assault beyond a reasonable doubt.” “The Alexandria Police and my office will diligently investigate and prosecute all hate-motivated crimes.” Ready has completed the active portion of his sentence in jail and has been released under the supervision of a probation officer.",1,0,3

In September 2016, two black boys — one age 4 and the other 11 —were playing in the courtyard of the apartment complex in which they lived. Their, apparently, drunken neighbor, 54-year-old Brenda Mae Glenn, became irate upon seeing them and began shouting the N-word and “bastards” at them. Another neighbor, 68-year-old Ola Mae Keyes, called the police to report Glenn’s harassment, after which authorities warned Glenn to back off or she’d have consequences to face. Read More Woman Charged With Hate Crime After Racist Attack On Black Couple This, evidently, had no effect on the woman because she continued to shout abuse for more than an hour. Keyes and the boys’ mother, Tierra Dizer, then decided to confront Glenn, who became violent. The Oregonian reports that, according to Keyes testimony, Glenn shoved and scratched her and hit Dizer with a plastic bag with a beer bottle inside. The blow left Dizer with a large bump on her head. Although yelling racist slurs isn’t against the law in Oregon, physically attacking people obviously is. Given that she’d spent more than an hour yelling racist slurs before she got violent, Glenn initially faced the possibility of being found guilty of a hate crime, but the judge dismissed those charges since Glenn’s racist comments hadn’t been aimed at the two women. Prosecutors are still pursuing charges for the assault and for disorderly conduct. Their goal is to have Glenn serve time behind bars. Glenn’s sentencing was scheduled for Feb. 22, but she didn’t show up. Instead, she left a voicemail for the judge’s staff claiming that she needed to get her “affairs in order.” She is still wanted. Based on her despicable behavior, some time behind bars and maybe even rehab for alcoholism seem to be just what Glenn needs.

Are we going to maintain our civility with each other or are we going to let these groups that carry out hatred and violent acts intimidate us into submission? I say no, he told me. Its unfortunate that some aggrieved thug destroyed the monument - but its not all that surprising when you consider the level of violence and hatred in the public discourse. People need to focus on being civil and debating issues rather than thinking they can take the law into their own hands and commit acts of violence against people with whom they disagree, the senator said. Our country is better than what we are seeing. We have to settle down and find out who we are as a people. Maybe the good people of Arkansas should consider adding an additional commandment: Thou Shalt Not Be a Pinhead.",1,5,2
30,30,"An Illinois man is facing hate crime charges after spray-painting roughly 200 graves with swastikas, court records show. Timothy V. McLean, 34, of Glen Carbon, was charged with several counts of hate crimes, as well as vandalism and property crimes, after hundreds of swastikas were found on headstones and grave markers at Sunset Hill Cemetery early Saturday, the Belleville News-Democrat reports. Investigators have not released a motive for the defaced graves at the nondenominational cemetery. Two teams of groundskeepers used power washers Saturday and Sunday to remove most of the paint on the desecrated stones and markers, the cemetery’s family service manager told the newspaper. But “ghosts” of the swastikas still remain on some graves and require another round of cleaning to be completely removed, according to Jeanne Brunette. “It was very heartfelt,” she told the newspaper. “We all took a step back to really realize what happened. But after that, it was more or less coming together as a team.” Homes and vehicles in nearby Edwardsville were also defaced with swastikas, police told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Gov. Bruce Ratner, meanwhile, thanked volunteers who helped out with cleaning up the vandalized graves just ahead of a Memorial Day ceremony at the cemetery, where more than 1,300 veterans are buried. “There is no room for intolerance in our state, our society,” Ratner said on Facebook. “This symbol, so indignantly placed, must steel our resolve to never let the evil it represents rise again.” Calls seeking additional comment from Glen Carbon police and the Madison County State’s Attorney’s Office were not immediately returned. A judge set McLean’s bail at $100,000 after his initial court appearance, KPLR reports. It’s unclear whether he’s hired an attorney. One woman who visited the cemetery Saturday said she was shocked to see the grave of her grandfather, a US Marine, targeted in the vandalism spree. “I mean, I hadn’t cried about my grandpa in I don’t know how long,” Michelle Browning told KTVI.",1,0,2

(AP) - The mayor of Portland hailed as heroes two men who were stabbed to death trying to protect two women police say were the target of an anti-Muslim rant by a man on a light-rail train, a crime that shocked this city that prides itself on its tolerance. Police said theyll examine what appears to be the extremist ideology of 35-year-old Jeremy Joseph Christian, who is accused of killing the men Friday. Christians social media postings indicate an affinity for Nazis and political violence. The attack happened on the first day of Ramadan, the holiest time of the year for Muslims. It sent shockwaves through Portland. A memorial where the stabbing occurred grew steadily Saturday and there were night time vigils. The FBI and U.S. Attorney for Oregon said Saturday they are working with police in Portland to investigate the fatal stabbing of two men on a light-rail train who authorities say intervened when another man yelled racial slurs at two young women who appeared Muslim. The FBI says its too early to say whether the slayings Friday qualify as a federal hate crime, but U.S. Attorney for Oregon Billy Williams said theres a day of reckoning coming, a day of accountability. Christian is being held in the Multnomah County Jail on suspicion of aggravated murder and attempted murder. Authorities say the stabbing occurred after a man yelled racial slurs at two young women, one of whom was wearing a hijab, and other men attempted to intervene on a MAX light-rail train. Mayor Ted Wheeler decried the charged national political environment surrounding immigration, saying, Violent words can lead to violent acts. He also said the two men who were fatally stabbed when they intervened died heroes. Their actions were brave and selfless and should serve as an example, an inspiration to us all, the mayor said.

37,37,"*Brianna Brochu, 18, of Harwinton, Connecticut is facing a hate crime charge after she secretly “poisoned” her black roommate for several weeks. The evil and depraved college student admitted to police that she rubbed her bloody tampon on the backpack of Chennel “Jazzy” Rowe, as well as licked her plate, fork, and spoon, out of “spite,” police say. Brochu, a freshman at the University of Hartford, was arrested by the West Hartford Police Department on October 28 after she bragged about “finally getting rid of her roommate, whom she referred to as “Jamaican Barbie.” She proudly boasted about her rabid psychopathy on Instagram by revealing that she spit in Rowe’s coconut oil, poured moldy clam dip in her lotion and inserted Rowe’s toothbrush inside her own rectum. Clearly, Brianna Brochu is the product of incest or she was raised by the Church of Satan. This is not debatable. OTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Nicki Minaj’s Brother Seeks Dismissal of Child Rape Case Claiming Victim Lied About Age Rowe, also a freshman, detailed getting sick from a bacterial infection in a Facebook post. “It started with throat pain. I thought maybe because it’s colder up here, I’m just catching a cold,” she said. “After a month it got to the point where I had extreme throat pain that I couldn’t sleep, to the point where I couldn’t speak.” Rowe said a doctor at the clinic on campus prescribed antibiotics for a throat infection. “I’m spending my own money that my parents give me for food and groceries, the health centre on campus is not free — in fact they’re expensive.” She decided to move out when Brochu came into their room while she was studying and turned off the lights. After she moved out, Brochu bragged to her IG followers that she finally got rid of her roommate. She posted: “Finally did it yo girl got rid of her roommate!! After 1 1/12 month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons on her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn’t shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye Jamaican Barbie.” After moving out, Rowe said she discovered the Facebook and Instagram posts detailing the harassment she endured. Because she’s a white girl, the University responded slowly to the news of Brochu’s disturbing behavior. We all know that had the roles been reversed, the black girl would have immediately been expelled, stripped of her scholarship and hit with a dozen felony charges. Only when news of Brochu’s sick behavior went viral is when officials decided to act and “investigate.” In a statement posted Tuesday night, UHart President Greg Woodward said, “I am writing to you this evening to send a strong message regarding an incident that is deeply upsetting to me, our students, faculty, staff, and alumni. One of our students was the alleged victim of bullying and her story was shared across social media.

Nearly 300 headstones in the Jewish burial ground were knocked over, part of a wave of anti-Semitic violence which spared few corners of the United States in the last year and which struck this city with particular venom and focus; only one day after the Mt. Carmel attack was reported, two Philadelphia-area Jewish Community Centers received bomb threats. Eight months later, the Mt. Carmel repairs are complete. Tuesday morning, the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia will give a “symbolic first tour” of the cemetery to Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney. The perpetrators of the vandalism are still unknown. But an investigation found that, sometime between February 16 and 21, the assailants “entered the site through a hole in a chain link fence located on the northeast side of the property, forging an intentional path of destruction,” according to a statement from the Jewish Federation, which spearheaded the restoration efforts and received donations from almost 3,000 people, totaling more than $288,000.

Its a gut check for everywhere — and absolutely for Portland, said Christopher Douglas, who stopped at the memorial. Portland ... floats in a little bit of a bubble of its own liberal comfort and I think the reality is sinking in. Multnomah County Sheriffs Office Jeremy Joseph Christian Jeremy Joseph Christian (Multnomah County Sheriffs Office) (Multnomah County Sheriffs Office) Jeremy Joseph Christian, 35, was being held in the Multnomah County Jail on suspicion of aggravated murder, attempted murder, intimidation and being a felon in possession of a weapon. He was arrested a short time after the attack on Friday. He will make a first court appearance Tuesday, and it wasnt clear if he had an attorney. A phone at his home in Portland rang unanswered Saturday, and no one came to the door at his parents home. Police identified the victims as Ricky John Best, 53, of Happy Valley, Oregon, and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche, 23, of Portland. Police say Best died at the scene and that Meche died at a hospital. Meches mother, Asha Deliverance of Ashland, Oregon, confirmed on Facebook that her son had been killed. She did not immediately return a call to her business phone listing or a message sent through social media. He was a hero and will remain a hero on the other side of the veil. Shining bright star I love you forever, she wrote. Meche graduated last year from Reed College in Portland with a bachelors degree in economics, the college said on its website. Mayor Ted Wheeler said at a news conference that Best was an Army veteran and a city employee. These two men died heroes as a result of a horrific act of racist violence. Police say Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, of Portland was also stabbed in the attack and is in serious condition at a Portland hospital. Police say his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. Their actions were brave and selfless and should serve as an example, an inspiration to us all. They are heroes, Wheeler said. Police said one of the two young women on the train was wearing a hijab. The assailant was ranting on many topics, using hate speech or biased language, police Sgt. Pete Simpson said. Dyjuana Hudson, a mother of one of the girls, told The Oregonian/OregonLive that the man began a racial tirade as soon as he spotted the girls. Her daughter is African-American and was with a friend who was wearing a hijab, she said. He was saying that Muslims should die, Hudson said. That theyve been killing Christians for years. The FBI and U.S. Attorney for Oregon are working with Portland police. The FBI says its too early to say whether the slayings qualify as a federal hate crime; however, Christian faces intimidation charges, the state equivalent of a hate crime. Wheeler decried the charged national political environment surrounding immigration. Violent words can lead to violent acts, Wheeler said. All elected leaders in America...must work deliberately to change our political dialogue. Court records show Christian served prison time for first-degree robbery and second-degree kidnapping after a crime committed 15 years ago and theft and weapons charges were dismissed in 2010. The Portland Mercury, one of the citys alternative weeklies, posted an article on its website saying Christian showed up at a free speech march in late April with a baseball bat to confront protesters and the bat was confiscated by police. The article included video clips of a man wearing a metal chain around his neck and draped in an American flag shouting Im a nihilist! This is my safe place! as protesters crowd around him. Simpson confirmed the man in the videos was Christian and said investigators were aware of them. He declined to comment further. Neighbors who live next to Christians parents house — which was also his last listed address in court records — said the family was quiet and they often saw Christians two adult brothers but never him. One neighbor, Kenny Jenkins, said he occasionally saw Christian riding his bike around the neighborhood. The neighborhood is on the northern outskirts of Portland, an area that has been rapidly gentrifying in recent years because it remains one of the last affordable sections of the city. The homes immediately surrounding the Christian residence now hold biracial families and same-sex couples, Jenkins said. The parents are very quiet. The dad was always helpful, he said. Good people. Christian has had several encounters with the law, and spent time in prison for robbery and kidnapping charges years ago, according to court records and a defense attorney. In 2002, he was arrested and charged with first-degree robbery and second-degree kidnapping after he rode to a convenience store on his bike and held up employees there with a gun, according to court records and his court-appointed defense attorney at the time, Matthew Kaplan. When police caught up with him, Christian aimed the gun at himself before he was shot and injured by police, Kaplan said. He was sentenced to more than seven years in prison. Kaplan said he remembers the case vividly because Christian was so young, so earnest and had never been in trouble before. At the time, the attorney suspected the onset of mental health problems. Ill remember this case forever because it made no sense, he told The AP in a phone interview. At the memorial to the stabbing victims, 8-year-old Coco Douglas left a sign and some rocks she had painted with rainbow colors Her stepmother, Angel Sauls, said the attack had been particularly hard on their family because Sauls is black and Coco and her father are white.

Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, who had rushed back to Portland from London, held a news conference Saturday afternoon with police officials and community members to address the attacks, which have shaken residents. To have one guy stab three other guys in the neck is unbelievable, Portland Police Chief Mike Marshman told The Oregonian/OregonLive. Three men came to the aid of two teenage girls being harassed by a man police identified as Jeremy Joseph Christian. He was being held on charges of aggravated murder and attempted murder. Marshmans comments provided the only new details about what happened to the men. Rick Best, 53, died at the scene. Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23, died at the hospital. A third man, 21-year-old Micah David-Cole Fletcher, was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Loren Cannon, special agent in charge of the Portland FBI office, also spoke, pledging to work with the Portland Police Bureau. Its too early to say whether last nights violence was an act of domestic terrorism or a federal hate crime, he said. However, in the coming days, the FBI, PPB and the prosecutors will work together to share information, leverage resources and make determinations about future criminal charges. State and federal prosecutors pledged to hold the man accused of the crimes accountable for his actions, though federal prosecutors are still reviewing whether federal hate crime or civil rights charges will be added to the state aggravated murder, attempted murder and intimidation allegations. We stand with you, Cannon said, speaking of the families of the two men killed and one man wounded who stepped in to defend two teenaged girls from hate-filled vitriol. We wont allow these acts to go unanswered. Oregon U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams pledged, Theres a day of reckoning coming. Gov. Kate Brown condemned Friday nights double homicide and wounding of a third Good Samaritan as a crime of hate thats absolutely unacceptable in our Oregon. The governor, along with Wheeler, Marshman, Multnomah County District Attorney Rod Underhill and others, all met with members of the Muslim community before speaking to the press at the former Southeast Precinct on East Burnside. Marshman applauded Muslim leaders for meeting with law enforcement in the wake of the tragedy. They praised the heroic actions of the men who stepped in to stop Jeremy Joseph Christian, who is now in custody. They were all attacked because they did the right things. Their acts showed selflessness and should serve as an inspiration to us all, Wheeler said. The killer will face justice. Wheeler was critical of the current political climate in the country, saying it allows too much cover for those who spew bigotry. I implore Oregonian to come together at this time, the mayor said. Its not the first time, and its not going to be the last time, said Marta Guembes, of the Guatemalan council who attended the meeting. It could have been my daughters.

Prosecutors said Lee was heard saying, “I hate (N-word)s, and I’m going to kill me one today,” before he brandished the knife. They said the victim was able to escape Lee by jumping into a car and locking the door. Lee was also in possession of brass knuckles at the time of his arrest, prosecutors said. According to prosecutors, Lee is either mentally ill or has a deep-seated animosity toward African-Americans. Its shocking even though things are happening like that lately it still shocks that people would want to do this, resident Steven Maiden said. Lee was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. A hate crime enhancement was added to the charge. Lee was being held in jail on a $250,000 bond.

54,54,"An Illinois man accused of harassing a woman for wearing a Puerto Rican flag shirt at a Chicago-area park was charged Thursday with state hate crimes, authorities said. Prosecutors filed the two Class 3 felony hate crime charges against Timothy G. Trybus, Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Trybus could face up to five years in prison for each of the hate crime charges. He has a bail hearing Friday afternoon in Skokie. He also faces separate charges of assault and disorderly conduct after a June 14 incident involving Mia Irizarry that was recorded on video. He will go to court August 1 to face those charges. Trybus will be represented by a public defender, but one has not been assigned to him yet, the public defender’s office said. CNN has attempted to reach Trybus for comment. Officer resigns A parks officer has resigned after being criticized for not intervening during the June 14 incident. which was caught on video at a northwestern Chicago park. In it Irizarry pleads for help as a man harasses her, saying her shirt is un-American. The officer initially appears to ignore the pleas. Irizarry said she was celebrating her 24th birthday at Caldwell Woods park when the man approached her and asked her why she was wearing the sleeveless Puerto Rico flag shirt. It also had “Puerto Rico” written below the neckline. Irizarry recorded the encounter on her phone, saying she felt threatened, and posted the video to Facebook. On Monday, Forest Preserves of Cook County, which administers the park, tweeted that it was aware of the incident and video, and that it had launched an investigation. The Cook County Forest Preserve District police officer, Patrick Conner, resigned Wednesday, and the investigation into the incident continues, the agency said. An attorney for the Illinois Fraternal Order of Police Labor Council, which is representing Conner, said that the video “does not look good,” but cautioned that the video may not tell the whole story. “We don’t know what was happening outside the video; we don’t know what was going on inside his (Conner’s) head at the time,” the attorney, Tamara Cummings, said Thursday. “He was looking forward to an opportunity to explain what was happening. However, given the media attention and pressure, he decided to resign.” “Given his decision to resign, he won’t be offering any additional comment on what might have happened during this situation,” she said. “He’s very distraught and not happy about having to leave employment much sooner than he intended, but because of the strong reaction from the public and political figures, he thought it would be unrealistic to stay as an officer.” The preserve district police chief, Kelvin Pope, said he didn’t know why Conner apparently didn’t step in initially. Pope said Conner feels “he wasn’t given a fair shake,” and that “he was very remorseful.” But Conner resigned before investigators could ask him what happened during a disciplinary hearing, Pope said at a news conference Thursday. “(Conner’s) personnel file will reflect that this officer did not resign in good standing, with a note indicating that he left the district with discipline pending,” the park agency’s general superintendent, Arnold Randall, said. Call for hate crime charges Cook County Commissioner Jesús “Chuy” García had called for hate crimes charges against Trybus. “A charge for simple assault or disorderly conduct is not sufficient,” García said. “We cannot allow that ugly rhetoric to be the norm in Cook County.” Randall, the forest preserves superintendent, said his agency has apologized to Irizarry and refunded the money she had paid for a permit to gather at a picnic table area on the day of the incident. He said his agency would re-examine the diversity training for its officers and other employees. “It’s up to each and every one of us to present a better model to demonstrate with our own actions how to treat each other with more respect,” he told reporters Thursday. “We might start with the fine example presented by Mia Irizarry and her family, who handled this ugly incident with great composure, never stooping to the level of the man who attacked her.” The incident In the footage, a man can be seen approaching Irizarry saying: “You should not be wearing that in the United States of America.” He gets closer to her and asks “Are you a citizen? Are you a United States citizen?” Irizarry says Puerto Rico is part of the United States and the man approaches her multiple times. She asks a park police officer to help, saying, “I am renting this area and he’s harassing me about the shirt that I’m wearing.” Later she says: “Officer, I feel entirely uncomfortable, can you remove … please officer” as the officer is seen walking away from her. Then she says: “Officer, I’m renting, I paid for a permit for this area. I do not feel comfortable with him here, is there anything you can do?” The officer can then be seen talking to the man who gesticulates back and tells him to “shut the f*** up.” More police arrive and Irizarry says she still doesn’t feel safe. The man resumes his abuse, saying: “You’re not American, if you were American you wouldn’t wear that. You know that right?” A female officer asks to see his ID and can be heard telling him that he’s intoxicated, to which he replies, “Well that’s your judgment.” She explains that Irizarry has a permit and she warns him that he could be arrested “for not being compliant.” “You don’t come here harassing people,” the officer continues. “People have just as much right to be here as you and when you’re drunk, you don’t belong here.” The female officer then speaks with Irizarry, who gives her version of the incident and the officer explains that they were called to the area after a report that a man was choking a woman. Eventually the first officer on the scene takes notes of Irizarry’s account of the incident and says that he was at the scene due to the separate incident, noting that she was not being attacked though acknowledging she felt threatened. Irizarry can be heard explaining to the officer that the incident began when they had asked the group the man was in if they could move as they had a permit for the area. She said the group politely complied but her Puerto Rico shirt appeared to act as a trigger to the man. Puerto Rico is a US commonwealth with its own constitution. Puerto Rican residents have been American citizens since 1917 and have the right to vote in US presidential primaries, but not in presidential elections.",1,1,3

We spoke with a doctor of psychology to get her perspective on how race issues and politics can affect peoples behavior. If an individual does nothing but read that and watch it, it could have an impact on the way they think, said Dr. Beverly Matthews. Matthews says nationally charged political and cultural tension, especially in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, can also affect how people behave. She says those with mental illness can be impacted even more by social issues. Biologically, whats happening in their body, and the neurotransmitters in their brain, psycho, meaning how they think about whats happening, and social meaning, what is going on in the community, Matthews said. Doctor Matthews says taking a break and unplugging can help people who are affected by national issues. If an individual is out in the community among appropriate individuals, doing volunteer work, doing hobbies such as art, gardening, flowers, helping other people, they arent going to have that 24/7 dialogue, she said. They will have a much more positive impact in their life. Regardless of why someone takes action over their political or racial beliefs, Sangamon County States Attorney John Milhiser has a firm stance on hate crimes in Springfield. These morally repugnant statements that he made have no place in our community, and there is zero tolerance for hate crimes and actions such as the defendant undertook in this case, Milhiser said. Joseph Carlisle could also face charges of DUI and resisting arrest.",1,0,0
58,58,"An Illinois man who allegedly harassed a woman for wearing a Puerto Rican flag T-shirt in a now-viral video was charged with a felony hate crime on Thursday. The Chicago Tribune reported that the Cook County state attorney’s office announced Timothy Trybus was charged with two counts of a felony hate crime, which add to the charges of misdemeanor assault and misdemeanor disorderly conduct he was already facing. ADVERTISEMENT He was arrested by Cook County Forest Preserve District Police and is expected to be held before a bond hearing on Friday. The charges stem from a June incident in which Trybus, who was reportedly intoxicated, confronted a woman for wearing a shirt with the Puerto Rican flag emblazoned across the front. Among other things, Trybus said the woman, 24-year-old Mia Irizarry, was un-American for wearing it. You should not be wearing that in the United States of America, Trybus said in a video that Irizarry posted on Facebook. As of Thursday morning, the video had be seen 1.5 million times. Irizarry informs her accuser that Puerto Rico is part of the United States. The island is a U.S. commonwealth, and Puerto Ricans are American citizens. “You should not be wearing that in the United States of America,” Trybus later says in the video, moving closer to her. “Are you a citizen? Are you a United States citizen? The news of the federal hate crime charges come the same day a Forest Preserves police officer resigned for failing to intervene during the incident. The department announced on Twitter that Officer Patrick Connor would no longer serve in the police force. In the video, Connor can be seen walking away after Irizarry asked him for help. Another officer eventually intervened and asked for Trybuss identification.",1,1,3
60,60,"TULSA, Okla. (AP) Jurors convicted an Oklahoma man of murder and hate crime charges Wednesday for fatally shooting his Lebanese neighbor after bombarding him with racial and anti-Muslim insults in a long-running feud with his family, who are Christian. Stanley Vernon Majors, 63, was found guilty in the August 2016 shooting death of Khalid Jabara, 37, outside his Tulsa home. Majors also was convicted of threatening an act of violence. Prosecutors said Majors spent years in conflict with the Jabara family, often hurling racial and religious epithets at his next-door neighbors. The conflict between the neighbors escalated to the point where the victims mother, Haifa Jabara, obtained a protective order in 2013 that required Majors to stay 300 yards (275 meters) away and prohibited him from possessing any firearms until 2018. But prosecutors said Majors, who also had a 2009 felony conviction from California for threatening a crime with intent to terrorize, was undeterred. Despite the court order, Majors was accused of plowing his car into Haifa Jabara in 2015. She suffered a broken shoulder, among other injuries. Authorities said Majors kept driving after he struck her. Officers who stopped him later reported that he was intoxicated. While awaiting trial on assault and battery charges, a judge freed Majors from jail on $60,000 bond, overruling strong objections by Tulsa County prosecutors, who called him a substantial risk to the public and pleaded with the court to set a higher bond of $300,000.",1,3,0

According to TMZ , Weezy has been slapped with a lawsuit by a security guard who has accused him of committing a violent hate crime.

Breaking News In Los Angeles Nicholas Rose, 26, was charged in court Thursday with attempted criminal threats, violation of civil rights and the sentencing enhancement of a hate crime, which carries a 6-year, 6-month sentence. Officials say a Rose family member tipped them off to his potential violence. Officials said on or about April 16, 2018 Rose told a family member that he wanted to kill people while making threats against Jewish people. The family member contacted the Orange Police Department. The police investigated. They went to the Irvine home where Rose — an ESL teacher — rents a room. They accuse Rose of being in possession of .22 ammunition, anti-Semitic literature, “kill lists” of prominent Jews in the community and entertainment industry, a list of steps he allegedly called “Killing My First Jew.” Officials said Rose also possessed papers referencing at least one church and one synagogue in Lake Forest, less than five miles from where he was living. CBS2’s Stacey Butler reports Rose was also targeting a Russian Orthodox church as well as a Greek Orthodox church believing they “were sympathetic to the Jewish cause.” He was arrested at the scene. Investigators are checking Rose’s computer to see if he is a member of a hate group. A neighbor told Butler she was shocked that such hate could be near her doorstep. “[I have] so many friends,” said Laura Wichems, “who are Jewish and who go to synagogues in Orange County.

68,68,"Brianna Brochu is now a former University of Hartford student and is facing a hate crime charge for harassing and intimidating her ex-roommate, Chennel “Jazzy” Rowe. Brochu, 18, of Harwinton, Connecticut, admitted that she licked her roommate’s “plate, fork and spoon, put tampon blood on (her) backpack, and mixed Rowe’s lotions with other lotions also on Rowe’s desk” out of “spite,” according to court documents obtained by Heavy. Brochu is white and Rowe is black. The case gained national attention Tuesday after Rowe posted a Facebook Live video documenting the treatment she received during her first weeks of college. Brochu’s name was trending worldwide on Twitter Wednesday morning as she made her first appearance at Hartford Community Court and learned the case would not be taken as lightly as it originally appeared. In an Instagram post, Brochu wrote, “Finally did it yo girl got rid of her roommate!! After 1 1/2 month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons (on) her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn’t shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye Jamaican Barbie.” Brochu, who was charged with second-degree breach of peace and third-degree criminal mischief, both misdemeanors, faced Judge Tammy Geathers Wednesday morning at the community court, which is typically where minor cases are heard. Cases there end with community service and eventually lead to the charges being dropped and expunged. But the state prosecutor said her office has decided to move the case to Hartford Superior Court, the criminal court where more serious charges are heard, because of the “severity” of the allegations. She is currently free on $1,000 bail. The judge barred Brochu from the University of Hartford campus and issued a no-contact order with the victim. She told Brochu that if she contacts or tries to contact Rowe in person, by phone, on Facebook, on Instagram or elsewhere, she will be found in violation of the conditions of her release. Brochu, who was flanked by her parents in front of the judge, responded, “Yes your honor.” She did not say anything else during her brief hearing. Brochu and her parents did not comment at the courthouse and she is not yet represented by an attorney. Shortly after the hearing, West Hartford Police sent out a press release saying they are seeking to add an additional charge, second-degree intimidation based on bigotry or bias, a class D felony that carries a potential sentence of 1 to 5 years in prison. The intimidation law states: A person is guilty of intimidation based on bigotry or bias in the second degree when such person maliciously, and with specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of the actual or perceived race, religion, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity or expression of such other person, does any of the following: (1) Causes physical contact with such other person, (2) damages, destroys or defaces any real or personal property of such other person, or (3) threatens, by word or act, to do an act described in subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection, if there is reasonable cause to believe that an act described in subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection will occur. It was also announced Wednesday morning that Brochu is no longer a student at the University of Hartford. It is not clear if she was expelled or withdrew from the university. “I am writing to provide further updates on the deeply disturbing situation involving our students. As of this morning, Brianna Brochu is no longer a student at the University of Hartford. She will not be returning to the institution,” University of Hartford President Greg Woodward said in a statement. Woodward added, “There has been an outpouring of concern for the victim of these acts from across the University and the country. In my meeting with her yesterday, I reiterated my personal commitment to ensuring she has all available personal and academic resources the University can provide.

74,74,"Investigators say they believe there is a connection between three package bombings in Austin, Texas. The first explosion happened in early March killing one black man. The other two explosions happened within five hours of each other. One killed a teenage black boy and seriously injured an adult woman. The other detonated at a house farther south, seriously injuring a Hispanic elderly woman. Interim Chief of Police Brian Manley told KXAN the packages were average size boxes. We will leave no stone unturned because we are not going to allow this to go on in our city, Manley said. Investigators say its too early to say what motivated the attacks but have not ruled out a hate crime. The two victims killed in the explosions are relatives of prominent members of Austins African American community, the Washington Post reports. The first victim, 39-year-old Anthony Stephan House, was the stepson of Freddie Dixon, a former pastor at a historic black church in the city. The second victim, who was 17-years-old, is the grandson of Norman Mason, a dentist in the area who mentored African American student-athletes at the University of Texas at Austin. Masons wife, Lavonne confirmed that her grandson was killed in the explosion Monday morning. Are you trying to say something to prominent African American families? Freddie Dixon asked. I dont know who theyve been targeting, but for sure, they went and got one of my best friends grandson. Somebody knew the connection.

77,77,"The attack seems to fit with a pattern of growing attacks on Muslims, which corresponds to a heavy focus on the threat of Islamist terror attacks, both in Europe and in the United States. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said in early June that hate crimes against Muslims had spiked after an ISIS-inspired attack on London Bridge. In the United States, a man has been charged with hate crimes after he shot two Indian men in Kansas, killing one; the defendant, Adam Purinton, told a bartender he had shot two “Iranians.” In May, two men died in Portland after being stabbed when they tried to stop a man who was delivering an anti-Muslim tirade against two women on a commuter train. (A Muslim teenager was abducted and killed after leaving a mosque in Fairfax, Virginia, on Sunday. Police there say there’s no indication she was assaulted based on her race or religion, but added “it’s not definitive.”) Meanwhile, there are other forms of anti-Muslim violence cropping up around the world. In Eastern Europe, vigilante groups are patrolling borders to try to intercept Muslim refugees. In Australia, an anti-Muslim gang has taken to walking the streets of Melbourne, putatively to deter crime. Terrorist attacks against Muslims are not a new phenomenon. Anti-Islam hate crimes have been elevated in the U.S. since 9/11, and in 2012 a man killed six people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, and it was speculated the shooter had confused the turban-wearing adherents for Muslims. While ironclad statistics are impossible to come by, the concentration of terror attacks in predominantly Muslim countries guarantees that Muslims make up by far the greatest number of victims of terror attacks worldwide. “In cases where the religious affiliation of terrorism casualties could be determined, Muslims suffered between 82 and 97 percent of terrorism-related fatalities over the past five years,” the U.S. government’s National Counterterrorism Center calculated in 2011—before the rise of ISIS. The grim accounting is clear that the number of deaths in these attacks against Muslims in the West still stands below the number of fatalities in jihadist attacks in Europe and the United States. In purpose, however, the attacks are similar: The death toll is always just one part of a terrorist attack, along with the intent to intimidate and to force changes in government policy. Meanwhile, despite the attention to recent attacks in London and Paris, among others, the number of jihadist attacks in Europe seems to be on a downward trend. A report released last week by Europol, the EU’s police agency, found there were 13 jihadist attacks within the union in 2016, down from 17 in 2015. The 13 attacks paled in comparison with the 99 incidents over the same year involving ethno-nationalists and separatist extremists, although the jihadist attacks produced almost all of the deaths. Still, the total of jihadist victims, 135, was also down from the 2015 total of 150, though the two huge attacks in Paris that year accounted for most of those deaths.",1,3,0

The witness was driving with her children and there was a long line of cars behind her, which forced her to drive away. However, she managed to come back and check Lina, who at that point was bleeding excessively. “When I told my kid that I want to go back and check, they were a bit scared.

82,82,"February 21, 2018 (Quad Cities, IL) — A passenger put a gun to the head of a Sikh Uber driver after demanding to know “which country do you belong to?” and telling him “I hate turban people” on Sunday, January 28th. After three weeks of advocacy, the Rock Island County State’s Attorney announced on Friday, February 16th that his office has a conflict of interest in the case and must refer it to the Illinois State’s Attorney Appellate Prosecutor’s Office in Springfield, IL. “We refuse to hypothesize about what the conflict of interest inside the Rock Island County State’s Attorney’s Office is, but it’s fair for all of us to wonder why this very straightforward hate crime case has dragged on for three weeks without an arrest and hate crime charges,” said Sikh Coalition Legal Director Amrith Kaur. “We will continue working with Gurjeet Singh and the local sangat to ensure justice in this case.” Gurjeet Singh, a father and husband who wears the Sikh turban and beard, has lived in Northwest Illinois for the last three years and serves as the head granthi (religious community leader) at his local gurdwara (Sikh house of worship). Mr. Singh faced the assailant while driving for Uber and then notified police the next day about the clear bias-based assault. After vigorous advocacy, which included legal, policy, communications and grassroots engagement, no charges have been brought and no arrest has been made. “In a textbook hate crime case, Gurjeet Singh’s attacker pointed a gun at his head and violently threatened him with racist, xenophobic language that targeted his Sikh articles of faith,” said Sikh Coalition Legal Director Amrith Kaur. “Hate crimes affect not just individuals, but entire communities, and we cannot combat hate without acknowledging it and addressing it head on.” The Sikh Coalition has connected with the Illinois State’s Attorney Appellate Prosecutor’s Office in Springfield, IL, who is awaiting the case file from the Rock Island County State’s Attorney’s Office, and will continue to work with the appropriate authorities as we seek justice in Mr. Singh’s case. A decision on what charges to file will be forthcoming, and the Sikh Coalition remains ready to respond. For now, we encourage concerned community members not to contact the Springfield office because they are still waiting to receive the case file and are in contact with us. This assault follows a pattern of bigotry impacting Sikhs and other minority communities across America. The FBI has documented a sharp increase in hate crimes, and this incident underscores the need to further amplify efforts to prevent and combat hate as we work for better hate crime data, stronger hate crime laws, and increased education. We continue to provide free legal aid to Sikhs who have been discriminated against or have suffered bias. Relatedly, our Gurdwara Security Initiative provides free resources to help Sikh houses of worship minimize the risk of attacks. Finally, we have a variety of free educational resources, including community brochures and know your rights materials. “The work that the Sikh Coalition has done in response to this hate crime has been remarkable,” said local Sikh community leader Gurlabh Singh. “Their presence in the Quad Cities has made a lasting impact and the local community remains resolute in achieving justice for Gurjeet and working closely with the Sikh Coalition moving forward.” Thank you to community leaders and grassroots advocates who have helped lead the work to secure #JusticeForGurjeet throughout the Quad Cities.

According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, 27-year-old Matthew R. Ellis was found not guilty by reason of insanity after Chesterfield County, Va., Circuit Court Judge Lynn S. Brice reviewed reports from two mental health professionals who came to the conclusion that Ellis was insane at the time of the May 3 attack. “The evidence supporting the insanity defense was overwhelming in my view,” Todd Ritter, Ellis’ attorney, told the Times-Dispatch. “The reports indicated that Mr. Ellis was suffering from bipolar disorder, and this was a manic episode with psychotic features.” Judge Brice ordered Ellis committed to the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services to be evaluated to determine if he may be released, with or without conditions, or if he requires continued confinement, the report notes. A hearing to determine whether he should be released was scheduled for Jan. 29. From the Times-Dispatch: Early in the case, Ritter disclosed in court filings that Ellis was paranoid and delusional and that his family had implored him to seek psychiatric help just days before the assault on the motorist. When Ritter first met his client in jail, Ellis claimed Ritter was an “imposter lawyer sent to further the conspiracy and injustice the defendant believes is being perpetrated against him,” Ritter said in court papers. Advertisement According to the prosecution, Ellis, a computer scientist at Fort Lee in Virginia, was apprehended in May after pulling up alongside a young black woman’s car in traffic. Ellis began screaming obscenities at the woman, who decided to change course and turn in the opposite direction in an effort to get away. Ellis, however, followed the woman, actually hitting the rear of her car with his own vehicle, before getting out of his vehicle, yelling that he was going to kill the woman and then opening the driver’s side of the woman’s car and dragging her out by her ankles, authorities said. Advertisement The woman was able to escape with the help of two other men and ran into a nearby business, where the employees locked the door. Ellis attempted to force his way into the building, but the same two men who helped the victim restrained him until police arrived. As he was being arrested, he spat on two Chesterfield officers. Ellis at first refused to answer any questions but then started using racial slurs and saying that he intended to kill the woman, authorities said. When one of the officers asked if he wanted to hurt the woman because of her race, Ellis said, “Yes.” Advertisement Ellis, who faced a charge of hate crime assault on the woman, as well as two counts of assaulting a law enforcement officer, statutory burglary and reckless driving, was acquitted on all counts as a result of the judge’s ruling. “I was pleased by the outcome and glad to see that Mr. Ellis will now be getting the help he needs,” Ritter said. “In fact, there was intervention early on [after the arrest], so my client has been on proper medication for some time, and he is not remotely the same agitated and paranoid person I met shortly after his arrest. “I was fortunate to have met Mr. Ellis very soon after the incident, and I also heard promptly from his family and numerous co-workers and friends, so it quickly became apparent that this was a mental-health breakdown, and that he was not some violent racist,” the attorney added. “The victim must have been utterly terrified, and I can assure you Mr. Ellis would have never wanted to be the source of that fright and pain for anyone.” Advertisement Read more at the Richmond Times-Dispatch.",1,0,0

90,90,"After three days of testimony, a jury Thursday evening unanimously found Jabreeh Davis-Martin guilty of killing Jodie Henderson. Jodie Henderson Since his brutal murder in January 2016, Hendersons family has sought ‘Justice for Jodie.’ Meantime, Henderson’s death also raises concerns about protections for victims of hate crimes. Evidence presented in court this week points to the fact that Henderson, an openly gay man, was murdered because of his sexual orientation. State hate crime laws enforce harsher penalties on criminals who target victims because of their race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or disability. Yet in Indiana, its a law that is missing, oftentimes leaving community members feeling vulnerable and unprotected. “But I know a change gonna come.... my sons favorite song,” said Pat Forrest, Henderson’s mother. Pat Forrest rejoices after Jabreeh Davis-Martin learns his fate: guilty for the murder of her son, Jodie. “I feel good, I feel good,” said Forrest. A slice of justice served... “We all been waiting for Justice for Jodie, thats what we all been wanting and we finally got it,” said Lucille Henderson-Benton, Jodie’s twin sister. But only the beginning in a larger battle. “I’m about to fight for this hate crime law because it should be a law in place for people just in case this ever happened again,” said Henderson-Benton. “This is a guy who was a war veteran... in the war in Afghanistan. He was a young person, and he was evidently attacked and killed because of who he loved,” said Mayor Pete Buttigieg, City of South Bend. Only five states in the nation do not have hate crime legislation. They are Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, Wyoming and lastly, Indiana. “That’s the exact opposite and direction our community, society and country is moving and thats why we ought to have a legal framework that reflects that,” said Buttigieg. The latest attempt to pass a bill targeting hate crimes failed in February. “Our state legislature is not always on the forward edge of social progress but this is a chance to make sure Indiana gets out of the bottom of the pack,” said Buttigieg. While no action will bring Henderson back, the verdict brings a sense of closure to loved ones. “Jodie is looking down and hes partying. He is partying,” said Henderson-Benton. Last year, a study from the Associated Press found that 52 percent of police agencies across the state of Indiana failed to file hate crime reports with the FBI over a six year span. Indiana has the nations third-highest percentage of police departments that didnt file these voluntary reports. If Indiana had this legislation and Davis-Martin was convicted of a hate crime as well, his prison time could have been greater. Davis-Martin now faces between 45 and 65 years in prison for murder. His sentencing hearing is set for July 21. To read our full report on this week’s jury trial, click here. ",1,4,0
91,91,"The Davis woman accused of carrying out the hate-crime vandalism at a local Islamic mosque wrote of having “dreams and aspirations” of killing people, and glorified Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof in social media postings, according to a Davis police declaration seeking to enhance bail in the case from $40,000 to $1 million. Lauren Kirk-Coehlo also “made derogatory remarks using the terms ‘Jews, Mexicans and (N—–s)’ on a regular basis,” conducted online searches regarding local mosques, bomb vests and Quebec mosque attack suspect Alexandre Bissonnette, and described herself as having “mental problems” in texts to her mother, Detective Dan LaFond wrote in the document, a copy of which is contained in Kirk-Coehlo’s court file. The information was culled from Kirk-Coehlo’s cell phone, which was seized during a Feb. 1 search of her North Davis home. Some of her alleged comments were contained in private messages in her Twitter account, according to LaFond. “Based on Kirk-Coehlo’s hate-motivated vandalism along with her glorification of Roof and Bissonnette, who recently killed African Americans and Muslims in their place of worship, along with her own statement of having dreams and aspirations of killing, concern law enforcement,” LaFond wrote. “I believe Kirk-Coehlo is an immediate danger to the public.” The bail enhancement was granted by Yolo Superior Court Judge Samuel McAdam, who also signed Kirk-Coehlo’s arrest warrant. See a copy of the arresting officer’s bail declaration here (includes offensive language): Bail declaration Davis police arrested Kirk-Coehlo, 30, on Tuesday morning following a three-week investigation by local and federal authorities into the Jan. 22 vandalism at the Islamic Center of Davis, which has been classified as a hate crime. Kirk-Coehlo, a 2004 Davis High School graduate, was taken into custody at about 11:20 a.m. on a felony warrant charging her with vandalism with a hate crime enhancement, as well as vandalism to a church. View the criminal complaint here: Criminal Complaint, Feb. 14 The arrest occurred at Kirk-Coehlo’s home on Corona Drive in North Davis, where local police and FBI agents served a search warrant in connection with the case on Feb. 1 but remained tight-lipped about the probe until Tuesday morning. An arraignment hearing is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Thursday in Yolo Superior Court. In the meantime, Kirk-Coehlo remains in Yolo County Jail custody, the high bail amount reflecting “the seriousness of this felony offense, the fact that it is a hate crime,” District Attorney Jeff Reisig said. “In order to file these charges, we had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt based on the evidence submitted to us … that we could prove these charges, and we believe that,” Reisig said during a news conference Tuesday at the Davis police station, where he, Davis Police Chief Darren Pytel and FBI Special Agent in Charge Monica Miller discussed the investigation and arrest. Yolo County Jail officials have declined to release Kirk-Coehlo’s booking photo in advance of Thursday’s court hearing. She turned down an interview request from The Davis Enterprise. Kirk-Coehlo has no criminal history in Yolo County, where court records indicate her only police contacts were for traffic-related offenses in 2007, 2013 and 2016. She was charged with misdemeanor trespassing in Santa Barbara County in 2004 but pleaded guilty to a lesser infraction, according to a district attorney’s spokeswoman there. Pytel said his agency received multiple tips after releasing security-camera footage from the Russell Boulevard mosque showing the suspect in the case smashing windows, vandalizing bicycles and draping what was later determined to be bacon — a prohibited food in the Muslim religion — on an exterior door handle during the early-morning hours of Jan. 22. Damage was estimated at $7,000. “We received quite a bit of information after releasing the video surveillance, and detectives were able to piece together other aspects of the crime, which led to the arrest today,” Pytel said. Pytel declined to comment regarding any statements Kirk-Coehlo may have provided to investigators or detail the evidence obtained during the search of her home and vehicle. No other suspects are believed to be involved, and Pytel said the vandalism does not appear to be connected to a threatening letter that the Davis Islamic Center and other mosques across the nation received in late November. No one answered the door at Kirk-Coehlo’s home Tuesday. A neighbor, who declined to be identified, expressed shock and sadness when informed of the arrest. “I just feel very bad for the family. I thought she was a very positive, friendly person,” the neighbor said. “I didn’t sense any negativity. She was always very polite, and always seemed very happy.” According to Reisig, to prove the hate-crime element of the case, prosecutors must prove that the crime was committed, “in whole or in part because of the victim’s religion or ethnicity.” The church vandalism counts allege that the crime was committed for the purpose of intimidating and deterring people from freely exercising their religious beliefs. Combined, the felony charges carry a potential punishment of up to six years in state prison, Reisig said. Pytel thanked both the FBI and Davis police detectives for their efforts to solve the case, highlighting in particular the work of LaFond and other officers he said “have taken this crime very seriously from the outset and have been put in a tireless amount of time investigating this crime.” While no federal charges are pending in the case, Miller, the FBI agent, said they could be forthcoming in light of the civil-rights violations being alleged. “That has to be evaluated, and it will take a length of time,” Miller said, noting that such charges would involve cooperation between the U.S. Attorney’s Office and local law-enforcement agencies. Also observing Tuesday’s press conference were members of the Davis Islamic Center’s executive board, who welcomed news of an arrest but said they harbor no ill will toward the suspect. “In a way, we want to thank her, because she brought us all together,” Mohamed Kheiter, the board’s treasurer, said of the outpouring of support the Islamic Center received from residents of Davis and beyond in the wake of the vandalism. “It made us more powerful and more active in our community.” Five days after the crime, hundreds of people gathered in Central Park to demonstrate their solidarity with the Muslim community, and the Islamic Center received more than $22,000 in financial contributions that Kheiter said have been used to repair the damaged windows, upgrade the center’s security system and support outreach efforts such as sending local students on educational tours of UC Davis and its medical school. “This incident showed the beautiful good will of Americans and that our communities stand united,” added Amr Zedan, the Davis Islamic Center’s president. “As a Muslim community we are forgiving and merciful, but we hope that the perpetrator has the chance to reflect upon her actions and the grief she caused our community.” Several organizations also offered rewards for information leading to an arrest and prosecution, the distribution of which “is something we will look at as the case progresses,” Pytel said. Kheiter said he and others of his faith ultimately want an opportunity to meet with the suspect face to face. “We know she did it for lack of knowledge,” Kheiter said. “She deserves an opportunity to learn about us. We are sure if she learned about our beliefs, she would regret what she did.” Mayor Robb Davis, a proponent of restorative justice, said he hopes that conversation occurs. “I think they deserve some answers like that. Also, for her — is there an opportunity to learn from the harm caused?” said Davis, who characterized the news of Tuesday’s arrest as “bittersweet.” “We’re thankful that we have someone in custody, but it’s one of our own,” he said. “I think we’re all just grasping to understand how this happens.” — Reach Lauren Keene at [email protected] or 530-747-8048.

Maggie Gilroy / Staff video (Photo: Shutterstock photo) The Tompkins County District Attorneys Office has charged a Cornell University student with a hate crime relating to an incident on Sept. 15. District Attorney Matthew Van Houten charged John Greenwood, 19, a man accused of yelling racial slurs and hitting a black man, with the hate crime. Greenwood was charged with assault in September after a black student said he was attacked by several people outside his home near Cornells campus. Greenwood punched the victim in the face after yelling a racial slur several times, Ithaca City Court documents stated. Court records state Greenwood selected his victim in whole or substantial part because of a belief or perception regarding the race, color, national origin, ancestry ... of a person, regardless of whether the belief or perception is correct. Van Houten also charged Greenwood with second-degree aggravated harassment and fourth-degree criminal mischief. The criminal mischief charge stems from an accusation of damaging another victims iPhone. Following the incident, the fraternity Psi Upsilons alumni Board of Governors announced the closure of the Chi Chapter at Cornell indefinitely and said the property at 2 Forest Park Lane would be re-opened for “the use of student organizations at Cornell that are dedicated to promoting a diverse and inclusive student community,” according to a statement from university officials.

94,94,"The Ohio man accused of killing a woman when he plowed a car into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, now faces federal hate crime charges. The Department of Justice announced that an indictment returned Wednesday charges James Alex Fields Jr., 21, of Maumee, Ohio, with 30 crimes, including one count of a hate crime resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, and 28 other hate crimes involving an attempt to kill dozens of other people who were injured. Another charge accuses him of racially motivated violent interference. Last summers violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. Todays indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation. Authorities have said Fields, described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the Unite the Right rally Aug. 12 that drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a Confederate monument. Fields already faces state charges including first-degree murder and is set to face a jury trial later this year. He has been in custody since the rally. The attorney representing Fields on those counts couldnt immediately be reached for comment Wednesday. The car attack came after the rally had descended into chaos — with violent brawling between attendees and counterdemonstrators — and authorities had forced the crowd to disband. The eight-page indictment alleges Fields decided to attend the rally on or before Aug. 8. As he prepared to leave to travel to Charlottesville, a family member sent him a text message urging him to be careful, the indictment said. Fields replied, Were not the ones who need to be careful, and attached an image of Adolf Hitler, according to the indictment, which also says Fields used social media to promote racist views. Fields then attended the rally Aug. 12, engaging in chants promoting white supremacist and other racist and anti-Semitic views, the indictment said. After authorities forced the crowd to disband, Fields drove his car toward the area where a racially and ethnically diverse crowd had gathered to protest, the indictment said. Fields rapidly accelerated, through a stop sign and across a raised pedestrian mall, and drove directly into the crowd, it said. In a statement, FBI Special Agent in Charge Adam S. Lee of the Richmond Division thanked the business owners and Charlottesville residents who he said worked with us and provided a massive volume of evidence in this case. The federal civil rights case is not the first under Sessions Justice Department, but it is certainly the most high-profile one. Critics of Sessions for the last year have been concerned about what they see as less aggressive enforcement of federal civil rights laws, and especially the Justice Departments lack of intervention against local police agencies with troubled relationships with minorities. But in bringing the prosecution, Sessions appeared to assert himself as independent from President Donald Trump — who blamed the violence on both sides and was accused of emboldening racists — and suggested that the Justice Department would continue to treat racially motivated acts of violence as hate crimes.",1,0,0

People marched with signs in honor of the men shot at the Austins Bar and Grill. One man died and two others were injured, all were of Indian descent. Authorities have charged 51-year-old Adam Purinton with first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder. A bartender at the restaurant where a man was arrested last week for an apparently racially motivated bar shooting in Kansas told a 911 dispatcher that the man admitted shooting two Iranians and needed a place to stay for a couple of days. A recording from Henry County, Missouri, 911 reveals that the bartender warned police not to approach the building with sirens blaring or the man would freak out and something bads going to happen. According to witnesses, the shooter yelled get out of my country at two 32-year-old Indian men, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, before he opened fire at Austins Bar and Grill in the Kansas City suburb on Wednesday evening. Kuchibhotla was killed and Madasani injured. The two had come to the U.S. from India to study, and they worked as engineers at GPS-maker Garmin.

(Published 5 hours ago) The shooter, Adam Purinton, 51, of Olathe, appeared by closed-circuit TV before a Johnson County District Court judge Monday on charges of first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder. Purinton was wearing a safety smock meant to keep him from harming himself during his first court appearance. A Johnson County Sheriffs Department spokesman, Master Deputy Rick Howell, said suspects who make statements during initial jail processing that could suggest they might harm themselves are required to wear the smocks until mental health professionals say otherwise. Howell would not disclose what Purinton said at the time he was being processed or whether he is considered a suicide risk. Public defender Michael McCulloch declined to comment. Purintons next court appearance is set for March 9. The incident drew the attention of Hillary Clinton Monday. In a tweet, she called on President Donald Trump to speak out about threats & hate crimes on [the] rise, and linked to a Kansas City Star article that quoted Kuchibhotlas wife seeking answers on how the U.S. stops hate crimes. Soon thereafter, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the early reports out of Kansas are equally disturbing as threats and vandalism that targeted the Jewish community across the United States. After the shooting, Purinton, who is white, drove 70 miles east to an Applebees restaurant in Clinton, Missouri, where he made the shocking admission to the bartender. In the 911 call, the bartender told the dispatcher a man had come into the bar and said hed done something really bad and was on the run from the police. He asked if he could stay with me and my husband, and he wouldnt tell me what he did. I kept asking him, and he said that he would tell me if I agreed to let him stay with me, the bartender said. Well, I finally got him to tell me and he said, like, that he shot and killed two Iranian people in Olathe.... Authorities have declined to discuss a possible motive for the attack or to say if they were investigating it as a possible hate crime. But the incident has raised concern about the treatment of immigrants, who feel targeted by President Donald Trumps promises to ban certain travelers, build a wall along the Mexico border and put America first. The University of Kansas Health System released a video Sunday of an interview with Grillot, of Grandview, Missouri, who is recovering after a bullet went through his right hand and into his chest. Grillot said he had to do something because there were families and children in the bar when the gunfire erupted. Grillot said he is grateful that the attack is bringing the community together and that it is awesome honestly to be able to give people a hope that not everybody hates everybody.

And transgender people are at the forefront of that fight, and they are the ones who are suffering most obviously.” The first of three one-hour specials, “Love & Hate Crime” (8 tonight, Investigation Discovery). takes viewers to rural Mississippi to explore the case of transgender teen Mercedes Williamson who was murdered by her gang member boyfriend, Josh Vallum, who in 2017 was the first person sentenced on a federal hate crime. Mr. Vallum claimed “gay panic” and “trans panic,” that he didn’t know his girlfriend was trans. Evidence emerges that shows his claim may not be true. Mr. Steele said he sees the program as less a call-to-action than a call-to-understand. “And this film is, hopefully, complex enough for you to walk away from it and to not feel like, here are the monsters, here are the bad guys, and here are the good people, and here are the people who are the victims,” he said. “We want people to feel conflicted. Josh did a heinous crime. He committed it. But in many ways you could think of his crime as not just an act of violence against Mercedes, but an act of violence against himself. How do you end up in a place where you would rather commit murder and you value your liberty and your freedom less than the thing you value the most, which is keeping a secret? And I think that if people can come away from this and just talk about the subject. … Its not about polarized disagreement, but its about a conversation.”",1,2,0

Jackson Township will treat this as a hate crime and when found, the perpetrators will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Police Chief Matthew Kunz confirmed the incident and provided more details. “We have had a recent upswing in juvenile mischief in the park, to which we have responded by increasing patrols in the area,” Kunz said. “A report was made to the police department regarding an image “dragged” into the mulch, but upon arrival of our officer, the image was gone, as well as was the reporting party. Another parent was determined to have also observed and covered the images, along with the reporting party, without remaining on scene and talking to our officer.” Kunz said the original caller, and the other parent, may have distributed the photographs, although the images were already removed prior to police arrival. He added, that a follow-up with the reporting party this morning confirmed that the reporting party removed the images from the mulch prior to police arrival. “The Jackson Township community will not be intimidated by such acts of hate.” Jackson Mayor Michael Reina said in the release. “We do not condone this behavior and it will not be tolerated.

(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post) A Prince George’s County grand jury indicted a Maryland man on one count of murder in the stabbing of a Bowie State University student that is being investigated as a possible hate crime. The indictment, issued Thursday against Sean Urbanski, 22, comes nearly two months after Richard Collins III was killed visiting the University of Maryland campus in College Park. Local and federal law enforcement said they are still sifting through evidence to decide whether Urbanski should also be charged with a hate crime — a determination expected in the coming weeks. “Developing a motive is always a challenging . . . and in this case and every other case, we can’t get it wrong,” Angela Alsobrooks, the state’s attorney for the county, said in announcing the murder charge Thursday. [Salutes and a folded flag at funeral for Bowie State student killed in possible hate crime] Collins was visiting two friends at U-Md. on May 20 when Urbanski approachedthem at a bus stop around 3 a.m., police said. Urbanski told Collins to move, police said, and Collins refused. Urbanski, who is white, then pulled a knife and stabbed Collins, an African American, in a “totally unprovoked” attack, police said. Urbanski fled but was later found near the scene of the stabbing with a folding knife in his pocket, police said. The incident was captured on video, prosecutors said. “He was simply standing with friends when, completely unprovoked, he was repeatedly stabbed at the bus stop,” Alsobrooks said. Collins’s slaying came during what should have been a time of celebration for the young man, who was to graduate from Bowie State days later and had recently been commissioned in the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant. Urbanski’s attorney, who did not respond to a request for comment Thursday, said previously that drugs and alcohol may have played a role in the incident. [Authorities investigating whether U.-Md. stabbing death was a hate crime] The possibility of drugs and alcohol in Urbanski’s system are “still aspects of our investigation that we’re not prepared to discuss,” Alsobrooks said. When reached Thursday, a spokesman for the Collins family said they would not be commenting on the indictment. If Urbanski is convicted, Alsobrooks said her office would seek the maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. Collins’s killing drew national attention and outcry. Urbanski’s association with a Facebook group that is called “Alt-Reich: Nation” stoked concerns of a possible hate crime amid heightened racial tensions at the University of Maryland and at other colleges across the country. Authorities said the group posted racist and inflammatory material, but one of the site’s creators told the media that the page was intended to be satire. In response to Collins’s slaying, the University of Maryland announced a number of initiatives intended to review how the college investigates, reports and prevents hate crimes. [Hateful acts may be rising, but will court cases follow?] Initially, authorities said it didn’t appear that the stabbing was racially motivated, but they later enlisted the FBI’s help after finding Urbanski’s link to the social media page. Alsobrooks said law enforcement officials still have “quite a bit of evidence to go through” as they determine possible hate-crime charges. Urbanski had “multiple digital devices” that will take time to analyze, she said. If authorities determine that Collins’s killing was racially motivated, prosecutors can request a superseding indictment from the grand jury to charge Urbanski with a hate crime. “Because we appreciate and respect that this family deserves to know as best we can why this happened to their son, it’s important for us to get it right,” Alsobrooks said. “The ‘why’ is something we all want to know.”",1,0,0
110,110,"Two Teens Charged with Hate Crime for Vandalizing Trump Sign, Letter and Spirit of the Law Be Damned Would you consider Trump supporters a protected class who should be covered under hate crime laws? Police in Princess Anne, Maryland, apparently do. Law enforcement officials in the town have charged two teen girls—DAsia R. Perry and Joy M. Shuford, both 19—with a hate crime for setting fire to a Trump “Make America Great Again” sign. According to the Baltimore Sun, an officer wrote in the arrest report that “intentional burning of these political signs, along with the beliefs, religious views and race of this political affiliation, directly coincides with the victim. The paperwork states the pair burned the sign, which was posted in the parking lot of a sporting goods store, “because of said victims race and religious beliefs based on the victims political values. As the Sun notes, “The only way to make any sense of this charge is to assume that anyone who is a minority (as both Ms. Shuford and Ms. Perry are) who dislikes President Trump must then automatically hate white people and Christians. Put another way, the Princess Anne police evidently think that to be a Trump supporter is synonymous with being white and Christian.” SPONSORED The charges suggest the police in this case are going out of their way to punish the two girls for making a nonviolent gesture of disrespect toward those who are “white and Christian.” That tells you precisely how the police view these two groups and whose stature they think needs protecting. Caryn L. McMahon, the deputy chief fire marshal, defended the hate crime charge by describing the sign burning as an act of discrimination or malice toward a particular group, or someones belief.” In other words, the police are equating vandalism of a pro-Trump sign with acts of harassment, aggression or violence that specifically target African Americans, LGBT, Muslims or disabled people. It’s not enough to charge these girls with arson, destruction of property and trespassing, among other things, which already seems far too punitive for such a minor act, but at least makes legal sense. These officials have decided that the “political values” of Trump supporters require unique protections and that mucking with one of their political signs should be seen as a particularly vile and dangerous crime. The Sun points out how that position is not only nonsensical, but doesn’t jibe with the letter or spirit of the law. “What Marylands hate crime statute prohibits is violence, harassment or destruction of property ‘because of anothers race, color, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, gender, disability, or national origin, or because another is homeless.’ Political beliefs dont make the list.” There’s a reason for that. The citation of “political values” and “belief” as areas covered under hate laws would vastly expand the grounds for arrestable hate crime offenses. As Elizabeth Nolan Brown writes at Reason: [A]ny political disagreement that turned nasty could be classified as a hate crime, leaving the offender(s) open to much more severe penalties than they would face for a solo charge of something like assault or harassment...And of course the possibilities for authoritarian abuse are tremendous. Political protesters arrested for minor offenses could have hate-crime enhancements thrown at them. Any act of civil disobedience would immediately become a hate crime...Are there people out there who really think this is desirable, making crimes of political passion especially heinous?” As the Sun observes, destruction of political signs during elections is fairly common. To classify every act in which a sign is damaged as a hate crime, with increased penalties, is absurd on its face. And that doesnt address the irony of police unilaterally declaring supporters of Donald Trump, a man who ran the most overtly racist campaign since George Wallace, a vulnerable group. “Expressing support for Donald Trump does not make you a member of a protected class, nor does opposing him make you an anti-white, anti-Christian bigot,” the Sun notes. “There have been plenty of real hate crimes committed since the election that have given people reason to fear for their safety based on their race, ethnicity or religion. This wasnt one of them.” The Hill reports that both girls have been released on a $20,000 bond. The fire is estimated to have caused $800 in damage. The Trump sign, which was barely burned, remains posted.",1,5,2
111,111,"NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Police have arrested a suspect who they said threatened a nun while she prayed inside a Brooklyn church. Derrick Gadson, 56, has been charged with hate crime aggravated harassment and criminal possession of a controlled substance, police said. Investigators say Sister Maria Amador’s prayers were interrupted and her life threatened Wednesday by a man inside the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph in Prospect Heights. “I thought this is my last day,” Sister Amador said. Surveillance video shows a shirtless man heading into the church. He is then seen approaching Sister Amador, who is Mother Superior of her convent, sitting by herself at a pew in prayer. Investigators say as he got closer, he said, “I don’t believe in this because you don’t help poor people.” When the nun did not respond out of fear, he became agitated. As Sister Amador looked around for help, she spotted a woman in another pew. “I started to look at the woman trying to say, ‘OK, I need help,’” she said. “But he said, ‘She can’t help you and I am going to kill you.’” That’s when the nun took off running and the suspect fled. Gadson has a criminal record with 40 prior arrests, CBS2 reported.",1,3,3

On Oct. 24, the Tulare County District Attorney’s Office announced two men arrested in connection with Oct. 22 attempted homicide in Goshen are now being charged with a hate crime. At about 4 p.m. on Oct. 22 deputies were dispatched to the 7000 block of Avenue 310 regarding a male that had been stabbed. The victim, who has only been identified as a 60-year old man, was located with multiple wounds to his upper body. The African-American male was airlifted to Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno where he has improved to stable condition. During the course of the investigation, detectives with the Sheriff’s Violent Crimes Unit identified the suspects as 25-year-old Hadden Kennedy and 39-year-old Jodan Peck who lived near where the assault took place. The two were originally arrested on charges of attempted homicide and booked at the Adult Pre-Trial Facility. It was later learned that the two men were using racial slurs during the attack and had been involved in arguments with the men in the past. This case is currently under investigation by the Tulare County Sheriff’s Office. Anyone with information is encouraged to call 800-808-0488.

114,114,"Sebastian Gorka For The Huffington Post, Marina Fang reports: “Sebastian Gorka, a White House national security adviser, defended President Donald Trump’s silence on an explosion at a Minnesota mosque by suggesting it could have been a fake hate crime ‘propagated by the left.’ When asked on MSNBC Tuesday why Trump had yet to publicly comment on the Saturday incident, Gorka said the president wants to wait until he learns more about it. Trump, though, often is quick to comment on other attacks, particularly those carried out by Muslims. ‘When we have some kind of finalized investigation, absolutely,’ Gorka said of whether Trump would respond to the bombing at the Dar al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington. He then suggested the attack could have been a ‘fake’ hate crime.” At MPR Laura Yuen says, “It took the FBI fewer than 24 hours to acknowledge last year’s stabbing attack at a St. Cloud shopping mall as a possible act of terrorism. Dahir Adan, a 20-year-old Somali-American man, stabbed 10 people at the Crossroads Center mall last September before he was shot dead by an off-duty cop. … But following Saturday’s bombing of Bloomington’s Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center, law enforcement and local media outlets have yet to use the word ‘terrorism’ in describing the incident.” Also, in the Strib, Pat Pheifer writes: “People of all faiths, all ages and all races came together Tuesday evening at the Dar Al Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington to show their support and denounce the destruction wrought from an explosive hurled into an imam’s office Saturday morning. The crowd of at least 1,000 people gathered on the back lawn of the mosque and listened to more than 20 speakers — imams, priests, rabbis and lay people. … U.S. Sen. Al Franken spoke, as did U.S. Rep. Tim Walz and other elected officials. Walz called the crowd ‘the best of what humanity has to offer’ and said the bombing was ‘a cowardly act of terrorism.’” Harteau speaks. MPR’s Brandt Williams talks to the former Minneapolis Police Chief: “Janeé Harteau says she did all she could to rush back to the city last month from a hiking trip after hearing one of her officers, responding to a 911 call, had shot and killed the caller. But by the time she returned, the damage was done. The killing of Justine Ruszczyk by officer Mohamed Noor sent the city reeling and morphed into an international incident. Nearly a week later, Harteau was out, with Mayor Betsy Hodges demanding her resignation. That blindsided the chief, who says now she initially didn’t realize the depth of anger ignited by the shooting — or the political fallout to come. “I wasn’t in a place where I could see what was happening,” Harteau, 53, told MPR News in her first media interview since her ouster.” To give you some idea of the effect diabetes has on health care, Stribber Jeremy Olson writes: “One in 16 privately insured Minnesotans suffer a ‘loss of good health’ due to diabetes, according to a new analysis by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, which adds up to thousands of people who will never reach their full life expectancies or will suffer chronic disabilities. The analysis, released Tuesday, is based on a new national Blue Cross ‘health index’ tool that estimates the prevalence and cost of diseases in states and counties based on the private insurance claims of 40 million Americans.” The horror! Tax money for … streets!? MPR’s Dan Kraker tells us, “‘I’ve got a news flash: Duluth streets are in terrible condition.’ That’s how Duluth Mayor Emily Larson kicked off a press conference Tuesday announcing a plan to hike the city sales tax 0.5 percent for up to 25 years to help repair the city’s 450-mile network of dilapidated streets. For Duluth residents, the state of the city’s long-suffering streets is no news flash. A recent survey showed more than 90 percent of Duluth residents lacked confidence in the city’s streets.” But, a tax increase! Can’t we close some schools or lay-off the fire department instead? A nearly lifetime gig. Jim Paulsen of the Strib reports, “After 31 years with the Minnesota State High School League, nearly all of them as the league’s executive director, Dave Stead announced Tuesday that he plans to step down from the position Feb. 1. … Stead, 74, began his career with the league in 1986 and was officially named executive director in March 1988. He is the longest-serving executive director in league history and the nation’s second-longest tenured leader of a state high school athletic association.” Unlocked. Says Mary Divine in the PiPress, “The Stillwater prison, on lockdown since a fight broke out among inmates in the A-West housing unit on Saturday, is returning to normal operation, prison officials said Tuesday afternoon. Minnesota Department of Corrections officials are still investigating the cause of the brawl at the Minnesota Correctional Facility-Stillwater, said spokeswoman Sarah Fitzgerald. … After the brawl broke out at about 9:30 a.m., the prison, which is in Bayport, was locked down and inmates were required to stay in their cells instead of going to work in the prison or participating in other programs, Fitzgerald said.” As you probably guessed. Paul Walsh of the Strib reports, “The wrong-way SUV driver who killed a motorist near Northfield was extremely drunk at the time of the late-night crash, according to a felony charge filed in the death of an Iowa attorney driving home from the Bruno Mars concert in the Twin Cities. … Law enforcement then took Dellwo to jail, where a preliminary breath test revealed his blood alcohol content to be 0.266 percent, more than three times the legal limit for driving in Minnesota.”",1,3,0

Burglars rummaged through her new home and spray painted racist messages on the walls last weekend.

Mayor Dale Graunke knows he can’t change their minds about moving, but he is hoping a show of unity and support on the steps of City Hall Sunday evening can send the Douglas family another message. “Not in our town and not anywhere,” he said. “It is one thing for people to not get along but it is another thing to hate and that’s the problem here.

119,119,"So far this year, the Chicago Council on American Islamic Relations has received about 400 complaints of discrimination against Muslim-Americans, the same number it received during all of 2016, according to Hoda Katebi, the organization’s communications coordinator. While the civil rights and advocacy group has seen steady increases over the last few years, Katebi says the spike significantly outpaces anything they’ve seen previously. Most of the reports cite incidents in Chicago and the surrounding suburbs, where Katebi says CAIR Chicago has the greatest presence. The reports of discrimination are varied. Some were filed by parents whose children experience bullying over their religion; others by people citing hostile comments from colleagues. Katebi, who wears a hijab, says that over the past few months she’s been called a “terrorist” while walking through city streets. While Katebi says she occasionally encountered that type of discrimination while growing up in Oklahoma, personal attacks like this have been occurring more frequently this year. “I know I’m a target because of the way I dress,” Katebi said. “My anxiety walking and crossing the streets has amplified.” The increase in complaints noted by CAIR comes on the heels of an incident involving the group’s deputy director and counsel, Sufyan Sohel. According to Sohel, a middle-aged south suburban man left him a profanity-laced voicemail that included threats to his life. “I had chills, just listening to the man’s tone and hearing his words: ‘We’re not afraid of you, we’re going to kill you,’” Sohel said. The man, who included his phone number in the message, was charged with a felony count of a hate crime and a telephone threat on June 17. As an attorney for a civil rights organization, Sohel said he knew exactly who to call and how to report the incident. But many people who experience acts of discrimination don’t know how to file a report, or may choose not to take any action at all, he said. A study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 65 percent of hate crimes occurring between 2007 and 2011 were not reported to law enforcement. “One of the biggest problems that we have in this country is a lack of reporting of hate crimes,” Sohel said. Katebi attributes the lack of reporting to the normalization and frequency of such acts against Muslim-Americans, and the fear of retaliation. Last week, CAIR launched a mobile app that allows users to report incidents of bias and provides information on constitutional rights. Data from the Chicago Police Department shows an overall increase in hate crimes. In 2016, Chicago saw a 20-percent increase in hate crimes, with 60 reported in 2015 versus 72 in 2016, according to police data. During the first five weeks of 2017, the CPD recorded 13 hate crimes—more than triple the number recorded during the same period in 2016. CPD data also shows that 2016 was the first year in which the majority of hate crimes were targeted against Muslims, Jews, Arabs and Hispanic individuals rather than African-Americans and the LGBTQ community. Federal Bureau of Investigation data found that anti-Islamic hate crimes increased by 6 percent between 2014 and 2015, more than hate crimes against any other religious group. “We see the rhetoric that’s out there that Muslims are a threat to the fabric of America,” Sohel said. “But Muslims make up the fabric of America just as much as anyone else.” Related stories: Is Hate on the Rise in America? May 11: The Chicago Police Department documented 72 hate crimes in 2016 – a 20-percent spike compared to 2015.

120,120,"Citing three people with knowledge of Woodwards links to the group, including a former member of the Atomwaffen Division, ProPublica reported that Woodward had joined the group in 2016 and attended a three-day training camp that included training in firearms, hand-to-hand combat, and survival skills. ProPublica reported Thursday that Woodward was an active member of a group called the Atomwaffen Division, a violent white supremacist group that advocates for overthrowing the US government. Carrie Braun, spokesperson for the Orange County Sheriffs Department, told BuzzFeed News that investigators have been looking into Woodwards possible ties to white supremacist groups, as well as other motives that could determine whether Bernsteins killing was a hate crime. Investigators have yet to determine a motive for the killing, which officials are looking into as a possible hate crime. Three days later, the Orange County Sheriffs Department arrested Samuel Woodward on suspicion of murdering Bernstein, a former classmate of his at the Orange County School of the Arts. Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old University of Pennsylvania student, went missing early this month while visiting his family in Southern California. After his body was found on Jan. 9, authorities discovered he had been stabbed more than 20 times before being left buried in a shallow grave. Investigators are looking into whether a 20-year-old man, accused of killing an openly gay and Jewish former classmate, has any ties to white supremacist groups, and whether those links may have played a role in the grisly killing, officials told BuzzFeed News. Braun told BuzzFeed News she could not confirm if investigators had confirmed whether Woodward had ties to any particular group. Investigators with both the sheriffs department and the Orange County District Attorneys office are still investigating the case, she said, and are looking at the possibility of multiple motives to the killing. A search warrant affidavit obtained by the Orange County Register revealed the two young men had met up on Jan. 2. According to the documents, Woodward told investigators that he picked up Bernstein in the parking lot of a Hobby Lobby and, from there, the two drove to Borrego Park, where Bernstein set out walking alone. According to the Register, Woodward told investigators he waited for an hour before leaving, but Bernstein did not return to the car; Woodward then left to meet a girlfriend. The affidavit noted that Woodward appeared to have cuts and bruises, which he said were from a fight club. When asked about dirt under his fingernails, Woodward said hed fallen into a dirt puddle during a sparring session. The affidavit revealed that the two men had also been in contact before the meeting and that Bernstein had told friends, via social media and texts, that he was planning to pursue Woodward sexually because he believed Woodward was about to hit on me and made me promise not to tell anyone..but I have texted everyone, uh oh. Woodward also told investigators Bernstein had kissed him and that he wanted to tell Blaze to get off him, according to the Register. Woodwards ties to Atomwaffen Division — a three-year old neo-Nazi group known to have multiple scattered cells across the country — has added another layer to the homicide case. According to the Anti-Defamation League, which monitors extremist groups, members of Atomwaffen Division often refer to a race war and make frequent references to Adolf Hitler and Charles Manson, who believed his killings in the late 1960s would spark a race war in the US. Though the group considered to be small and relatively young, the organization has already been tied to several acts of violence throughout the country. In May, one of the groups founders, Devon Arthurs, was charged in Florida with murdering two of his roommates, who were also members of the neo-Nazi group. According to the Miami Herald, Arthurs told investigators that the killings occurred because he had converted to Islam and his roommates had taunted him about his faith. Arthurs also told authorities that another roommate, Brandon Russell, another self-described neo-Nazi and member of Atomwaffen, had plans to blow up power lines and detonate explosives in a nuclear power plant. Russell has pleaded guilty to charges of possessing explosives and bomb-making materials in his Tampa Palms apartment. In December, 17-year-old Nicholas Giampa shot himself in Virginia after shooting and killing Buckley Kuhn-Fricker and her husband Scott Fricker — parents of his former girlfriend who had urged her to break up with him because of his white supremacist views. The Huffington Post reported the 17-year-old was a fan and former member of the Atomwaffen group, and ProPublica reported the teenager had been in contact with members of the organization, according to another former member. According to the Anti-Defamation League, Atomwaffen Division activity has been reported in Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas, Massachusetts, Washington, and Wisconsin.",1,0,0

124,124,"A terrible incident that occurred in York County in late April — an unprovoked attack on an African-American, allegedly by two white males — was a reminder that racism is alive and well. The two men are accused of violating the Maine Civil Rights Act, which was enacted in 1992. This law prohibits the use or threat of violence or damage to property against a person based on that person’s race, color, religion, sex, ancestry, national origin, physical or mental disability or sexual orientation. A person who is found in violation of the law is convicted of a class D crime. In Maine, a class D crime is a misdemeanor, punishable up to 364 days in jail and a $2,000 fine. When I learned that this crime is only a misdemeanor in Maine, I was shocked. If these two individuals are convicted, it’s essentially a slap on the wrist, and they can go home for violating the constitutional rights of a person solely based on the color of their skin. The punishment does not fit the crime. I propose the classification for a hate crime should increase to a class B crime, which, under Maine law, is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $20,000 fine. When the Legislature returns in December, I plan on taking action by having a constituent bill introduced, calling for the law to be changed to a Class B crime. Connecticut is providing Maine — and the rest of the country — an example to follow, passing a law last year that increases the punishment for a hate crime from a misdemeanor to a felony and making a first-degree hate crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison and/or a $10,000 fine. It’s also instructive to look at other New England states’ hate-crime laws. In Vermont, criminal charges motivated by bias bring enhanced penalties: between one more year and five more years in prison with increasing fines. In Massachusetts, a person convicted of a hate crime can serve a misdemeanor penalty of up to 2½ years in prison and a $5,000 fine. However, if bodily injury results, the penalties increase to felony level: a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. The accusations against the two individuals in York County do not accurately represent the state of Maine. I know this for a fact. As an African-American who lives in an overwhelmingly white state, I have felt nothing but warmth and acceptance. But this is not the case for everyone who is not white, or speaks a different language, or loves another person of the same gender. In 2016, Maine had a rate of 3 reported hate crimes per 100,000 people, according to FBI statistics, while the national average was 2.1. What’s more, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis, Maine is one of just eight states where hate incident rates spiked in the 10 days after President Donald Trump’s election, compared to the average annual rate between 2010 and 2015. These data highlight a problem that needs to be mitigated and a need for stronger penalties for those who commit despicable actions based on prejudice and hatred. My motivation to change this law is not because the victim was an African-American and the alleged suspects were white. I believe that no other person should target, harass and/or assault another person because of something that makes them different. No one has the right to do that to anyone. I have been an advocate for equality in my own way by seeking to use the law and change policies. As an undergraduate, I drafted and proposed a student bill of rights; in graduate school, I became an ally for the LGTBQ+ community by becoming a SAFE trainer. Participants in Students, Staff and Faculty for Equality training provide education and awareness on various topics that affect the LGTBQ+ community. I also witnessed growing up what racism and bigotry can do to someone, years after it happened: i.e., my father, who was born in the 1940s and came of age during the 1960s and lived with the scars of what happened to him until he died in 2015. Maine is a welcoming state, but it also needs to show that when racism, bigotry and hatred attempt to rear their ugly heads, they will not be tolerated, and that those who interfere with a person’s civil rights will be held accountable and severely punished.

127,127,"Email Share +1 109 Shares SANTIAGO, Chile — Daniel Zamudio, a young gay Chilean man, was tortured for several hours and seriously injured by a group of four self-described neo-Nazis who attacked him in a Santiago park on March 2, 2012, because of his sexual orientation. His death 25 days later sparked outrage across the country and Zamudio became a symbol against homophobic violence in the conservative nation. The case accelerated the debate of an anti-discrimination and hate crimes bill that had languished in the Chilean Congress for more than seven years. Known as the Zamudio Law, this legal framework — which passed in July 2012 — created a mechanism for victims to denounce discriminatory acts based on a series of categories that include sexual orientation and gender identity and established a judicial process and sanctions. Chileans’ attitudes towards LGBT people have also become more accepting since Zamudio’s death. Wishing what happened to Zamudio will not happen to others, his parents created the Fundación Daniel Zamudio in his honor. His father, Iván Zamudio, has said the foundation’s objective is to share information about sexual diversity in schools, educate the public about the need for more inclusion and efforts against hate crimes. “My son’s case (created a) before and after situation in Chile,” said Iván Zamudio. “There was a change in people’s minds towards greater respect for sexual diversity and as a consequence we have seen a fight to achieve norms that protect gay community.” In the five years since Daniel Zamudio’s death, Chile has promoted initiatives to protect the rights of same-sex couples, including a civil unions law that took effect in October 2015. Chileans have also become more receptive to extending other legal protections to LGBT people. Activists: Zamudio Law is ‘ineffective’ Despite the social and legal progress, members of LGBT advocacy organizations have criticized the efficiency of the anti-discrimination law. Some leaders have pointed out the current legislation is insufficient to prevent anti-LGBT crimes and its framework does not include the proper protections and compensation for victims. Anti-LGBT violence in Chile also remains a serious problem. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in a 2015 report noted 26 cases of violence perpetrated against LGBT and intersex people in the country between 2013 and 2014. Movimiento de Integración y Liberación Homosexual (Movilh) claims 18 LGBT people have been killed in Chile since 2012. The Inter-American Commission of Human Rights says its report underestimates the actual number of incidents because victims are reluctant to come forward because of they fear extortion, violations of their privacy and retaliation. Movilh Director Rolando Jiménez has said the Zamudio Law is “poor,” considering only 13 of the 245 people who have filed complaints under it has received judgments in their favor. “That demonstrates how ineffective the law is,” added Jiménez. “Today, we have an instrument to react to a case, but there is a lack of institutionality working to educate people on sexual diversity and human rights matters,” Juan Enrique Pi, president of Fundación Iguales, told reporters last week in the Chilean capital of Santiago. Pi said more efforts to prevent discrimination are necessary. Both he and Jiménez have argued the new Undersecretary of Human Rights, which President Michelle Bachelet’s administration recently created, should undertake this task. The organizations have sent several proposals to Bachelet on how they feel her government can improve the Zamudio Law’s legal framework. They highlight, among other things, the creation of an anti-discrimination body and more guarantees to protect victims in the judicial process. The current law imposes fines against applicants who do not provide evidence to prove their alleged abuses. Members of the Chilean LGBT movement contend this provision should be changed. “The community is still being discriminated in workplaces and schools and it continues be target of attacks in the street,” warned Pi. Bachelet in January announced proposed amendments to the current law, which she is sending to Congress in the coming months. The decision was made as a part the amicable mediation process between the government and Movilh, in the context of a same-sex marriage lawsuit the organization filed in 2012. “When President Bachelet started her second administration, we delivered to her our proposal to make the law stronger,” said Jiménez. “We hope the discussion in Congress take place soon.”",1,4,0

The Hartford Courant reported that Brianna Rae Brochu, who is white, is facing a hate crime for the alleged ongoing harassment of Jazzy Rowe, her black roommate. In a video posted to Facebook, Rowe claimed that Brochu, 18, went online to brag about the alleged acts she committed after Rowe said she was moving out. Rowe noted that she was having throat pain for the month she lived with Brochu. After announcing that she was changing rooms on October 17, Rowe recalled seeing Brochu texting on her phone. Minutes later, two resident assistants alerted her to some unsettling claims Brochu made on social media. “Finally did it yo girl got rid of her roommate!,” Brochu allegedly boasted on Instagram, according to the Miami Herald. “After 1 1/2 months of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons on her backpack, putting her toothbrush where the sun doesn’t shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye to Jamaican Barbie.” This is your student Briana Brochu bragging about the vile things she did to her roommate @UofHartford #JusticeForJazzy pic.twitter.com/q44dDbEDTB — ?

142,142,"Word On Da Street SMH…The FBI is investigating whether the stabbing of a visiting black student by a white student at the University of Maryland was a hate crime but the answer to that question seems pretty obvious to us! Check out the details below… Sean Christopher Urbanski has been charged with first- and second-degree murder as well as first-degree assault in the early Saturday morning attack that killed Richard Collins III, police said. University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell said he asked the FBI to assist in the investigation after learning that Urbanski, 22, belonged to a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich: Nation,” where members post disparaging material about African Americans and others. “We are here to evaluate that as an ongoing concern with respect to whether or not this was a hate crime,” Gordon Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Baltimore, told reporters at a news conference. No attorney was listed for Urbanski on online court records and a message left at a number listed for his home in Severna Park was not immediately returned Sunday. Collins, 23, who was set to graduate from Bowie State on Tuesday, was visiting friends at the College Park campus when he was stabbed. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army days earlier, Mitchell said. Officials say Collins was with two friends near a bus stop on campus around 3 a.m. when they heard Urbanski screaming and watched him approach them. Urbanski said “Step left, step left if you know what’s best for you,” according to the charging documuents. Collins said “no” before Urbanski stabbed him once in the chest, the documents say. Mitchell, the police chief, said the attack has spread fear across the university. “If I’m a person of color I would certainly look at this as something that could happen to me. In fact, I know on Facebook our students are saying that,” Mitchell said. – via usnews.com SMH….These little Neo-Nazi/KKK-type splinter groups have been popping up left and right since you know who got elected and they need to be labeled as the “Terrorist Organizations” that they are.

145,145,"The suspect, identified as Shaun Urwiler, told deputies he was just trying to “throw a few donuts and wreak a little havoc,” according to police. A man intentionally broke through the gates of a mosque in Tampa, Florida, a few days before the Muslim’s holy festival of Eid while nearly a thousand worshippers looked on from inside in horror, according to police. However, the news of the alleged attack slipped through the cracks and only surfaced nearly two weeks later, after the suspect was already out on bail. Shaun H. Urwiler reportedly drove his pick-up truck into two parked cars before smashing right through the locked gate of the Islamic Society of Tampa Mosque where up to 1,200 people were present to break their Ramadan fast. [I was thinking] are my children outside? Thankfully, it was pouring rain outside, and I think that was a blessing in and of itself, recalled witness Aida Mackic, who is also a member of the Council for American-Islamic Relation. Had the suspect been a person of color or a member of minority community, the reaction would have been quite different. However, the incident went unnoticed. As the International Business Times reported, the 42-year-old suspect is an Iraq war veteran who, according to his brother, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. “I apologize on behalf of my family if anyone was scared,” said Neal Urwiler. “This is not something a sane person would do. Hes not that person and hes going to get help.” He also said the suspect had phoned him shortly before crashing his vehicle into the mosque gate, telling him of a dream he had of Iraqi city Fallujah, which witnessed fierce conflict during the war. Apparently, Urwiler also told deputies he just wanted to “throw a few donuts and wreak a little havoc.” “He was aggressive and mean. Like he’s mean. He is like [acting like] ‘I am going to do it!’” said another witness Gamal Farag who saw the truck plow through the cars and front gate and decided to follow it. “What you do this for? What make you do this? I don’t understand. What the reason? [sic] In my opinion, God will take care of him.” The deputies tracked down Urwiler a day later. The reports claim the suspected was erratic and yelled at the officers for about an hour after his arrest. He was also wearing a GPS tracking device around his ankle for a domestic violence injunction. Police charged him with criminal mischief to a place of worship and violation of a domestic violence injunction — both first-degree misdemeanors. He caused about $5,000 worth of damage, according to the police. “We hope that people come inside, ask questions, get to know your Muslim neighbors, added Mackic, hoping the incident would encourage the residents of Tampa to approach their Muslim neighbors and have a dialogue.

That means the suspect was stalking the organization. Read More Man Arrested For Assaulting Muslim Woman Had 70 Prior Convictions Hussein said the chapter received at least one piece of hate mail or call every week by virtue of its humanitarian work. “We just ignore those,” the executive director said of some lesser, vague threats. However, each year the organization also receives more serious messages and threats that forces it to call on law enforcement authorities. “When our staff received this email, we immediately were concerned about our safety and wellbeing of our staff,” Hussein said. “We do not take these threats lightly knowing that there is a great deal of people out there who are misinformed and often may lash out and attack Muslims,” said Hussein. CAIR-MN said hate crimes against Muslims have experienced an upsurge in recent months — and so have increasingly threatening letters to the Muslim advocacy organization. Last month, CAIR’s New York chapter received a letter that threatened “extermination, torture and rape” of Muslims.

150,150,"The biggest stories in crime and public safety the Long Beach area in 2017 involved the resolution of one of the city’s worst mass killings, a rise in hate crimes, a change that gave local police jurisdiction over the Blue Line and a city councilwoman embroiled in a criminal investigation. Here are the top stories: Mass killers convicted in homeless encampment slayings Trial for two of Long Beach’s worst mass killers came to an end in 2017, almost nine years after the slayings. In September, jurors convicted David Cruz Ponce, 36, and Max Eliseo Rafael, 31, of shooting five people at a Long Beach homeless camp on Nov. 1, 2008. At trial, prosecutors played jailhouse recordings of Ponce and Rafael bragging about the deaths of Hamid Shraifat, 41, of Signal Hill; Vanessa Malaepule, 34, of Carson; and Frederick Neumeier, 53, Katherine Verdun, 24, and Lorenzo Villicana, 44, of Long Beach. Prosecutors said Ponce and Rafael targeted Villicana over gang business, but the other victims were murdered solely because they were nearby or because they witnessed the slaying. Ponce was also convicted in a sixth slaying in the Lancaster area over a drug debt, prosecutors said. A judge hasn’t yet sentence either man. A jury recommended Ponce be put to death. Rafael Faces life in prison without parole. There were more hate crimes Mirroring trends in other large cities, hate crimes in Long Beach were on the rise earlier this year, experts said. But the spike in Long Beach was more pronounced than in many other areas, according to Professor Brian Levin, who directs Cal State San Bernardino’s Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. As of August, there’d been 12 hate crimes reported in Long Beach. The final tally for 2017 wasn’t immediately available. The city had nine hate crimes in all of 2016 and 12 in 2015, according to authorities. Part of the spike was because Long Beach was caught up in a wave of anti-semitic threats that swept the nation, police said. Twice in January, someone phoned in a bomb threat to a Long Beach Jewish community center. In March, authorities arrested an 18-year-old man suspected of phoning in hundreds of threats to Jewish centers across the U.S. Cal State Long Beach also saw a spate of racially charged incidents including white supremacist fliers posted around campus and a man allegedly threatening to shoot members of the La Raza Student Association. Long Beach police begin patrolling the Blue Line Riders started seeing Long Beach police officers instead of Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Deputies on the Metro Blue Line this year. The change marked a major shift in how law enforcement handles policing on the rail line. In February, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority board voted to have the Los Angles Police Department and Long Beach Police Department take over law enforcement duties on trains and buses Metro runs in those cities. The decision marked the first time in 14 years that any police agency other than the sheriff’s department patrolled Metro’s trains and buses. The five-year deal came as Long Beach is pushing for more transit-oriented development around the Blue Line and urging residents to forgo cars when possible. Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia was a vocal proponent of the shift. He called it an opportunity the make the Blue Line safer. According to stats from Metro, the Blue Line has had a disproportionate amount of crime compared to its other rail lines. Rains cause flooding Two powerful rain storms delivered one of the wettest winters in a decade in Long Beach, which saw homes flooded, sewage spills, downed trees, power outages and numerous rescues by public safety personnel. The biggest storms occurred on Jan. 22, when the city received close to 4 inches of rain (breaking all time records), and Feb. 17, when 2.5 inches of rain fell in the city by 7 p.m. that day, and public works crews received 27 calls about flooding and responded to fallen trees that damaged at least three homes and 10 vehicles. From November 2016 to May, the city received more than 18 inches of rain. A drunk driving investigation sets off political scandal Scandal embroiled a Long Beach politician and police pushed back on allegations of a coverup earlier this year. On June 3, CHP officers found Councilwoman Jeannine Pearce along the side of the 710 Freeway having an argument with her former chief of staff, Devin Cotter, who had a cut on his forehead. Cotter and Pearce later told police they’d been having an affair. Police ended up investigating Pearce on suspicion of drunk driving and domestic violence but decided against arresting her. The story took dramatic twists throughout the year and sparked a recall campaign. A columnist at the Beachcomber newspaper accused police of giving Pearce preferential treatment. But police said Pearce passed sobriety tests at the scene and said the couple gave conflicting, varying versions of how Cotter ended up with an injury. Most recently, police released hundreds of pages of documents detailing their investigation. Pearce won’t face charges of drunk driving or domestic violence, but Cotter admitted what happened that night was a violation of his probation for an earlier drunk driving conviction. However, the incident isn’t entirely resolved. The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s public integrity division is still investigating.",1,0,0

158,158,"Salutes and a folded flag at funeral for new Army lieutenant killed in possible hate crime Members of Bowie State Universitys ROTC program carry the casket of Richard Collins III into First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Upper Marlboro, Md. The stage beneath the blue-and-white church steeple in Maryland was not where Richard Collins III was to be celebrated this week. The young lieutenant, who had just been commissioned in the U.S. Army last week, should have marched across the stage at Bowie State Universitys graduation ceremony Tuesday to claim his diploma, in mortarboard and flowing black robe. Instead, hundreds of students, family, friends and fellow soldiers gathered Friday morning at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden to honor the young man who was fatally stabbed in College Park, Maryland, at the University of Maryland. The 23-year-olds death — now being investigated by the FBI is as a possible hate crime — baffled and devastated both campuses at a moment of heightened racial tension in America. The seemingly random killing at the threshold of Collinss military career drew condemnation from lawmakers around the state and an immediate promise from the University Maryland to launch a comprehensive plan intended to combat hate. Pauletta Handy, a 53-year-old Bowie resident and mother of a University of Maryland graduate, didnt know Collins, but she felt like she did. Im a black mother, she said at the church, her eyes glassy. To have a good kid like that, somebody who wanted to serve our country, and for him to get taken out not in Iraq but right here in our own country over racism. Collinss body arrived just before 8 a.m in a black hearse bearing the seal of the U.S. Army. White-gloved comrades in their dress blues quietly marched Collinss casket into the church as four others stood at the entrance in silent salute. Wearing dark sunglasses, Collinss mother clutched a handkerchief as she accepted hugs and condolences from friends, uniformed service members, politicians and police. The service was joyful at points, with cheers, applause and chants of hallelujah from the crowd. Our pain, our grief, our suffering is very, very deep, said Pastor Steve Pierce. Let us work together for peace and justice. The funeral comes six days after Collins was killed in what police said was a totally unprovoked attack while at a bus stop with two friends on the University of Maryland campus in College Park. Collins was visiting the campus when police say Sean Christopher Urbanski, a U-Md. student, approached the group at about 3 a.m. Saturday and told Collins to move. Collins refused before Urbanski stabbed him in the chest, police said. Urbanski, 22, of Severna Park, Maryland, has been charged with first- and second-degree murder and first-degree assault. Urbanskis attorney has said that drugs and alcohol may have played a role in the case. Prince Georges County police picked up Urbanski about 50 feet from where Collins had collapsed, court papers state. Police recovered a knife from Urbanskis front-right pocket, police said. He remains jailed on a no-bond status. The attack rattled both universities, which have been in the middle of spring graduation celebrations. Collinss slaying has stoked fear and concern among students and administrators at the College Park campus, where racially motivated incidents already had unsettled the community in recent months. Collins was black, and Urbanski is white. Although police initially said the attack did not seem to be racially motivated, authorities announced Sunday that they had launched a hate-crime investigation after they said they learned Urbanski appeared to have some involvement with a social media page called Alt-Reich: Nation. Were not supposed to be here, the Rev. Darryl L. Godlock said before the service, insisting that people stop hating one another, stop attacking one another. On Wednesday, U-Md. President Wallace D. Loh announced an action plan to combat hate and create a safer campus. The plan includes dedicating $100,000 for diversity and inclusion programs and the creation of a trained, rapid-response team offering services to the community hate-bias incidents. How could this happen to a young man with so much promise? Prince Georges County Executive Rushern L. Baker III wrote in a letter that was read during the service. He quoted John 15:13: There is no greater love than to lay down ones life for ones friends. Baker added that he hoped Collinss sacrifice inspires us all to drive out hatred, racism, and intolerance within our communities. The audience — which included U.S. Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Former NAACP president Ben Jealous — interrupted the reading with standing applause. One speaker suggested that Collins was standing up against bigotry the night of the stabbing. When he said, No, he said, This war is not going to be one that Im going to lose, said Artie L. Travis, the vice president of student affairs at Bowie. Travis said he longed for a day when he would not have to look over his shoulder in fear simply because he was a black man, a comment that resonated with Vicky Bruce. Thats something Ive never had to feel as a white person, said Bruce, who lives in the community where Urbanski resides. Bruce, 50, didnt know Collins but attended the funeral along with women from Anne Arundel County Indivisible. In Collinss honor the organization is pushing anti-hate legislation in the county, where a noose was recently found hanging outside of a middle school. If you let these racist groups survive and foster, its like a cancer in our society, said Bruce. Throughout the services, Collinss family, commanding officers and colleagues spoke fondly of the young man who loved lacrosse and soccer, who helped a relative build a robot for an engineering class and who wanted to serve in the military to follow the footsteps of his father and grandfather. Major Gen. Christopher Hughes, head of the U.S. Armys Cadet Command, said Collins kept the highest academic and physical test scores among his class while also encouraging other colleagues to succeed. Collins would pick up fellow cadets from the Metro station in the morning so they could make their physical fitness tests. He helped his fellow cadets reach their dreams and their goals, and I gotta tell you, that is pretty lofty for a man of a mere 23 years of age, Hughes said. Collinss cousins described him as a fiercely opinionated person who was always eager to defend his beliefs. They shared stories of their mischief, including the time he cut a younger cousins hair. He was the fun coordinator, his oldest cousin Kristal Godfrey said, but he was also the preacher when they played church. Godfrey told the crowd gathered to honor her cousins memory with love, remarks that drew swelling applause. I want to challenge you to love, she said. Not the hippie kind of love. Im talking about that fierce, unrelenting love. . . A love that stands up for what is right. . . that does not allow hate to persist. Services ended Friday with Collinss mother accepting an American flag on her sons behalf, just as her husband did days before when he walked across the stage at Bowie States graduation to accept their Richies diploma.

159,159,"Community activists bowed their heads on Tuesday in Upper Marlboro, before demanding justice for Lt. Richard Collins. Collins was stabbed to death days before his graduation from Bowie State University. UMD student Sean Urbanski is charged with his murder. “We are looking for a hate crime conviction,” said Bob Ross, who is President of Prince George’s County’s NAACP chapter. He’s hoping that authorities will find enough evidence to charge Urbanski with a hate crime. So far, police have linked Urbanski to a white supremacist Facebook group, but they are still looking into whether racial hatred was the motivating factor behind Collins’ murder. “If you don’t get this hate crime conviction, what will you do? asked ABC7’s Anna-Lysa Gayle. “We’re going to demonstrate, hold the University of Maryland accountable, we’re going to educate our community,” said Ross. Meanwhile, recent UMD grad Yanet Amanuel is speaking out about the climate on the campus in recent months. “Since last November alone, we have experienced many things like finding our campus posted with racist fliers, said Amanuel. “Despite all of these incidents, President Loh and the rest of the UMD administration have not responded appropriately.” President Wallace Loh is working on a campus-wide task force that will review UMD policies and procedures related to hate-bias and campus safety.

160,160,"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Maryland authorities have asked the FBI to help them investigate whether the fatal stabbing of a black student at a college campus over the weekend was a hate crime. The tragedy comes as civil rights groups expressed great concern over what they said was a rise of bias incidents across the nation’s schools. Richard Wilbur Collins III, 23, was killed early Saturday while visiting friends at the University of Marylands College Park campus. Collins, a senior at Bowie State University, was just days away from his graduation. Hed finished the ROTC program in college and had been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. army on Thursday, according to officials. The victim was stabbed to death by 22-year-old suspect old Sean Christopher Urbanski, a white student at the University of Maryland, in what was first described as a “totally unprovoked” attack, authorities said. University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell said Sunday evening at a press conference that he asked the FBI’s field office in Baltimore to aid in the investigation after it was discovered that Urbanski belonged to a Facebook group, Alt-Reich: Nation, which featured bigoted posts. Suffice it to say that its despicable,” Mitchell said. “It shows extreme bias against women, Latinos, members of the Jewish faith and especially African Americans.” Mitchell said local police and the FBI will probe whether hate or bias was a motive in the murder. He said he had not seen specific postings from Urbanski on the website yet. We are here to evaluate that as an ongoing concern with respect to whether or not this was a hate crime, Gordon Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Baltimore, said at the press conference. Urbanski has been charged with first and second-degree murder and first-degree assault and is being held in a county jail, officials said. He was ordered to remain in jail without bond at a court hearing Monday afternoon, according to a clerk at the Prince Georges County District Court. Murder suspect Sean Urbanski is being held without bond. University of Maryland Police Department via AP Collins and two friends were near a bus stop on campus at around 3 a.m. Saturday when they were approached by the suspect, official have said. The suspect approached the group and yelled at Collins, “Step left, step left, if you know what’s good for you, Mitchell said. A puzzled Collins looked at the suspect and said, “no,” according to Mitchell. “It was then that Sean Urbanski stabbed the victim in his chest,” he said. Collins was set to walk the graduation stage on Tuesday — at the same campus where he was killed. Bowie University uses the nearby University of Maryland campus for its graduation ceremony, Mitchell said. The case comes shortly after other recent incidents of racial bias. A noose was discovered at a fraternity house at the University of Maryland’s campus last month, and police were investigating it as a possible bias incident, according to NBC Washington. And earlier this month, bananas marked with the letter “AKA” — an abbreviation for the historically black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha — were found at least three locations on American University’s Washington, D.C., campus. The FBI’s Civil Rights division was helping the university investigate the incident. Those cases follow bitter and sometimes violent protests on U.S. campuses, following speaking invitations to controversial far-right figures such as Richard Spencer and Ann Coulter. Richard Spencer speaks at the Texas A&M University campus Dec. 6, 2016, in College Station, Texas. David J. Phillip / AP file Advocates told NBC News that although authorities were still investigating the specifics of this case, bias incidents and enlistment by groups espousing such ideologies has been increasing in American schools, especially after the contentious 2016 presidential election. Jonathan Greenblatt, the executive director of the Anti-Defamation League, told NBC News that Collins murder was appalling and deeply disturbing. This also comes on the heels of an increased tempo of recruiting on college campuses by white supremacists, he said. Greenblatt said the groups had not been highly engaged in college campuses in years past, but this year has been different. He added that members of groups espousing racist ideology had also increasingly turned to social media to recruit people or terrorize their victims. The ADL also said last month that according to its data, anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. surged more than one-third in 2016 compared to the year before, and jumped 86 percent in the first quarter of 2017 alone. Heidi Beirich, director of Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, told NBC News that the group had also noticed an increase in such incidents. “We’ve seen a rise in bias incidents from hate speech and everything leading up to attacks on people, both in the K-12 section and on college campuses,” she said. Although the group began tracking the data much more thoroughly after the election, in its most recent report chronicling bias incidents the group tracked a total of 1,863 reported cases from Nov. 9 through March 31, including 614 that took place on school grounds. The SPLC said 330 of those incidents took place on college campuses and 284 took places in schools grades K-12. The group also tracked 178 “white nationalist flyer” incidents, with 87 percent of those cases taking place on college campuses. Beirich also said the group had found that “increasingly people are getting radicalized online,” citing convicted Charleston church killer Dylann Roof as one example. Roof was sentenced to death earlier this year for killing nine black worshipers in a racially-motivated attack. When asked about the feeling on campus following the allegations in Collins murder, and the incident involving the noose last month, Mitchell said Sunday there was a tension at the school. Well, I think theres not only tension on this campus, but campuses throughout the United States, he said. We’re part of America and America is seeing tension. We see it here and we’re doing our best to combat that with our student body, he added.",1,0,0

164,164,"SALISBURY, Md. (AP) — A racial slur by a white student in her middle school classroom might have escaped attention except for one thing: Taylor Dumpson was listening. What she heard helped shape Dumpson’s sense of duty to confront hatred and injustices head on and with tact. That experience made a lasting impression on the Wicomico High School graduate that has carried into her college days at American University in Washington, D.C. Dumpson took the helm as president of the student government at the historically white college amid national media attention. Racist displays greeted her as the first black female in university history to lead the student body. Her mettle was immediately tested. Bananas were hung on nooses on the school’s campus her first day in office May 1. Advertisement Dumpson was interviewed about the incident and her resolve by CNN and national publications including the New York Times and Washington Post, and recorded a stand-up discussion on TEDx Talks on Thursday. She hopes sharing her experiences empowers others. “There is power in sharing your story, especially given the national climate right now,” she said. “You have to engage in these conversations to move forward.” Test of character The young Dumpson’s response to the classmate’s racial slur — for which she felt reprimanded — stands as one of the most important tests of her character and effectiveness as a leader. “I was obviously upset, and the student asked me if I was upset,” Dumpson recalled. “I smiled and said, ‘Yes.’ That’s all I said, and the student, who was my friend, started to cry. “My mom says to kill a person with kindness,” Dumpson said. The situation went from bad to worse, she said, when the teacher called on Dumpson to define the slur while standing before an academically gifted class of mostly white students. “I was the only black girl in the class and I had to read the definition before people who don’t look like me,” Dumpson recalled. “To say that it was awkward doesn’t describe it enough. I carry the experience with me today.” The incidents helped inspire Dumpson to confront hatred and injustice nonconfrontationally. When she learned that bananas were hung from ropes around the American University campus the day she started her term, Dumpson stayed true to her values. It was at Wicomico High School, in the county seat of Salisbury, that Dumpson, 21, embraced diversity. The minority-majority high school also taught her the value in advocacy for change, social and racial inclusion and open dialog about touchy topics from which others shy away. “Wi-Hi introduced me to social justice before I understood the meaning of the phrase, ‘social justice,” she said. “It sparked my interest in things like redistricting in Wicomico County and how we fund our education system. I was going to a school oftentimes perceived as the worst school in the county, and that is one of the reasons I chose American University.” The high school’s student body reflects a wide range of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. It is where Dumpson decided to prove naysayers wrong on several stereotypes, such as: (asterisk) Wi-Hi, which serves a large low-income population, produces outstanding graduates. “You can go to a place that is underserved and make something of yourself.” (asterisk) Black kids play diverse sports. She joined her high school lacrosse team because “I wanted to prove to people in Wicomico County that black girls can play lacrosse.” She also played freshman year at American. (asterisk) Black students can be successful at historically white universities, such as American University — even those who graduated from minority-majority high schools. “But if you had told me my freshman year in high school that I’d be going to one of the best private schools in the country, and would be student government president, I would have said you are crazy,” she said. It is no surprise that Dumpson is a leader at a respected university, said Margo Handy, assistant superintendent of instruction for Wicomico County public schools. “I met Taylor Dumpson when she was in elementary school and I was impressed with her then,” said Handy, recalling the student’s participation in the magnet academic program as well as extracurricular activities. “Every environment in which I’ve seen her, she has always been a leader,” Handy said. It also doesn’t surprise Handy that county students are top achievers beyond high school. “We have hundreds throughout the county like her,” Handy said. “We have students going to Ivy League universities and guess what? Several of these students are minorities. I’m proud of Wi-Hi because it has a larger minority population.” ‘Tangible change’ Dumpson is charged with excitement and optimism about working toward tolerance and inclusiveness. Already she is using her new role to create substantive and sustainable initiatives on her campus. She has unveiled a three-point objective for the upcoming academic year: (asterisk) To work in partnership with other campus leaders to update the Student Code of Conduct to make a hate crime a standalone violation, rather than a sub-offense of another crime. (asterisk) Advocate for increased campus security, with a primary goal to improve video and camera surveillance. (asterisk) Create an introductory student course on cultural competency. “Hate crimes are up since the 2016 election,” Dumpson said, pointing to the Trump Administration. Some observers believe campaign and post-election rhetoric have triggered public hostility and confrontation between supporters and non-supporters of the new president. “It appears to me that all gloves are off; people have no regard to civility,” said James King, associate professor of English at Salisbury University. He advises the SU student chapter of the NAACP that has led peaceful demonstrations to raise awareness of justice issues. “With change in our climate socially, culturally and politically, we are creating the environment for these things” like banana noose incidents “to happen more and more frequently,” King said. At SU, President Janet Dudley-Eshbach has instituted the Office of Institutional Equity, “and one of the key charges is to investigate and pursue complaints and concerns about assaults and things of that nature, and also to address hate crimes and issues related to discrimination,” King said. The office was created about a year and a half ago, he said. “The president decided to be proactive in the wake of incidents at college campuses nationwide,” King said. “I applaud Ms. Dumpson for trying to encourage students to enviably take the higher ground and not get drawn into the swamp of actions and activities” of hate proponents. The banana-noose incident was not the first hate-driven act since Dumpson enrolled at American University as a freshman three years ago. Nor is she American’s first black to be student government president. She blames a perceived climate of overt racism, although Dumpson also considers overt sexism as driving negative reactions to her presidency and similar incidents targeting other students. “It’s clear that it’s a gender thing,” she said. She recalled other noose incidents on the campus “and they targeted black females,” she said. Dumpson points to recent high-profile hate incidents throughout the nation: A noose was found in late May in a section of the nearby National Museum of African American History and Culture nearby, and about the same time, in Los Angeles, a home of NBA star LeBron James, who is black, was vandalized with slurs painted on a front gate. “There have been three noose incidents in D.C. since mine,” said Dumpson, a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha historically black collegiate Greek sorority. Some of the banana noose hangings at American had messages, “AKA free,” an apparent gesture toward the sorority. Another message scribbled was “Harambe bait,” referring to the gorilla killed at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2016 after it dragged a child that fell into the animal’s exhibit. Dumpson doesn’t live in fear, “but I am vigilant,” she said. She was shaken when notified of a troll campaign against her, reportedly initiated by a white supremacist. “People are more embolden to say these kinds of things,” she said. Opening a discussion Dumpson’s activism has the attention of national and international organizations wanting to engage in dialog about cultural competency, she said. She intends to participate in a national conversation about hate crimes on university and college campuses across the nation, a project involving Democrat Congresswomen Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas and Frederica Wilson of Florida. “They called for convening university presidents to have conversations about hate crimes on campuses,” Dumpson said. “They want to start with American University.” Dumpson’s ordeal has the attention of the United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore, says Kathleen Mommè, executive director. What better partners to spread a far-reaching message of unity than a peace advocate for diversity and inclusion and a national organization whose theme is “Live United,” Mommè said. “Following the hate crime, Taylor was faced with enormous national media attention and calls of support from across the country,” Mommè said. Dumpson’s mother, Kimberly, is an executive vice president at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore and a board member at the local United Way. Her father, Jeffrey, is an executive movie producer. Taylor Dumpson had indicated “she would like to turn this tragic event into something positive to increase awareness and sensitivity to inclusion issues and would like to meet with us here at United Way as our brand motto of Live United is a perfect fit,” Mommè said. Talks are underway, Mommè said, on a proposed pilot initiative that could be replicated nationwide through 1,400 independent United Ways. The agency also is looking at how it can partner with other national groups, she said. “This is the very beginning of an initiative we hope to take to scale across the country with the far reach of United Way into thousands of communities, with the end goal of increasing awareness and sensitivity to inclusion issues,” said Mommè, who anticipates a pilot project to roll out within six months. “It is our honor to assist Taylor to take this developing initiative to create more awareness and sensitivity to inclusion to scale nationwide and also right here on the Lower Shore.” American’s outgoing president Neil Kerwin recently described Dumpson’s approach as uncanny, with her ability to build dialogue and coalitions across different sectors and organizations. “Through fresh ideas and strong facilitation and leadership skills, she generates tangible change,” the former president said. His comments came when Dumpson recently earned the Newman Civic Fellowship, which supports students committed to helping communities. An example of that commitment is when she organized more than 900 first-year students for the Explore DC through Social Justice Program that focused on confronting social justice issues such as food and urban sustainability. Years after her smile of protest, on the field with Wi-Hi teammates at a lacrosse game, her character was tested when she competed against her former friend from middle school. “I put my best in for the game, but the incident was definitely in the back of my mind,” Dumpson said. “I proved my point. When I saw her, I just smiled.” Copyright © 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, written or redistributed.",1,0,3

168,168,"The body of 17-year-old Nabra Hassanen of Reston, Va., was found about two miles away from the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, where she had attended overnight Ramadan prayers. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post) The horrific weekend slaying of Virginia high school student Nabra Hassanen has prompted calls from civil liberties advocates and her supporters to investigate her killing as a possible hate crime. Virginia police officials initially said there is no indication the 17-year-old was targeted because of her religion and that her killing was a “road rage incident” as she and a group of other teens walked and biked along a street headed back to a mosque early Sunday. But Nabra’s family feels certain she was abducted and killed because she was wearing Islamic clothing as she returned to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society mosque in Sterling after the group had gone out for a late night bite to eat amid their Ramadan observance. [Killing of Muslim teen near Va. mosque stemmed from road rage, police say] Nearly 12,000 people had signed a petition calling for state and federal probes of Nabra’s killing as a hate crime. Nabra Hassanen (Family photo) A Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization criticized police on Tuesday for settling too soon on road rage as motivator and said the killing should be seen in the context of a rise in hate crimes targeting Muslims across the country. “We think it’s premature,” said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic relations known as CAIR. “We believe these incidents are at the core motivated by the perception that these subjects are Muslim.” Nabra’s family has said she was wearing a long women’s garment known as an abaya and a hijab head covering. Her funeral is set for 1:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Sterling mosque, Hooper said. Her beating, abduction and murder were clearly hateful acts, but bringing formal hate crime charges is more complicated. Proving a hate crime in court requires showing overt bias, that a person was motivated, for instance, by the victim’s religion, ethnicity, national origin or gender. [Hateful acts may be rising but will court cases follow?] According to the police, Darwin Martinez Torres, a 22-year-old construction worker, argued a teen on a bike who was part of the group before jumping a curb with his car and chasing the larger group before catching up to Nabra in a parking lot, where he is accused of hitting her with a baseball bat, abducting her and later killing her. The other teens reported what had happened — and that Nabra had fallen as they all fled — when they got back to the mosque around 4 a.m. Sunday, prompting a police search by Fairfax and neighboring Loudoun counties and the arrest of Torres within hours after a Fairfax officer noticed Torres circling near the crime scene, police have said. The body of 17-year-old Nabra Hassanen of was found in this pond between an office park on the 21500 block of Ridgetop Circle and an apartment complex. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post) Nabra’s body was found in a pond Sunday afternoon based on leads that police have not detailed. Fairfax County police said at a Monday news conference they have turned up no slurs or other evidence that Martinez Torres was motivated to kill Nabra because of her religion. Even so, they continue to probe the case and would revise their initial assessment if evidence of a hate crime is found, they have said. Most hate-crime cases are handled by state prosecutors and typically carry stiffer penalties than crimes charged without a bias component. Forty-five states and the District have specific hate-crimes laws. But most differ on what acts qualify and some leave it to judges to decide whether to impose stiffer penalties at the time of sentencing. Virginia’s hate-crime statute includes penalty enhancements for crimes motivated by race, religion and ethnicity. The Commonwealth’s law is not as comprehensive as measures in Maryland or D.C. that also cover bias related to gender, sexual orientation, disability and gender identity, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). Federal hate-crime charges generally carry even harsher penalties than state statutes. Federal prosecutors in Northern Virginia have not opened an investigation at this point. Beyond the tougher potential punishment, formally attaching the hate-crime label in court can signal to the broader community that certain heinous acts are different because of their intended impact. “Such incidents send shock waves through the entire community and have the potential to make communities feel unsafe and vulnerable,” ADL’s Washington regional director, Doron F. Ezickson, said in a statement. “We must come together to send an opposing message that all people, regardless of their religious or ethnic background, are safe, welcome and protected.” Ezickson said Tuesday his organization is monitoring the investigation and has “every confidence in law enforcement to determine what happened to Nabra and whether the circumstances of her death merit a hate crimes charge.” [What happens when tragedy strikes Muslims during Ramadan] Hooper, the CAIR spokesman, compared Nabra’s killing to a North Carolina case in which three Muslim college students were shot and killed in 2015. Police determined Craig Stephen Hicks’s motivation for killing the students in Chapel Hill was a parking dispute, but many Muslim groups thought it was a hate crime. The FBI and the Department of Justice opened a probe to determine if the case was a hate crime. No federal charges have been filed. Nabra’s father told detectives that he believes his daughter was killed because of her religion. “Why was he running behind the kids wearing Islamic clothes with a baseball stick? Why, when my daughter fell down, why did he hit her? For what?” Mohmoud Hassanen said. “We don’t know this guy. He doesn’t know us. We don’t hate anybody because of religion or color. I teach my kids to love everybody.” Julie Zauzmer contributed to this report.",1,3,0

As for the intruders’ motive, police said it “appears to be theft of property from inside the Islamic Center. At this time, there is no indication that this was motivated by a bias or hate crime.” Deputy Police Chief Mike Hartley said investigators are compiling a list of what was taken from the center, located in the 8200 block of Park Avenue S.

174,174,"Bias-Motivated Crimes, or hate crimes, are charged when a person injures another, harasses, or damages property of another based on the person’s race, color, religion, or sexual orientation. Recently, a Denver man was the victim of a hate crime when he came home to find the n-word written on this condo door. Police don’t have any suspects, but the community is secured, so the man is wondering if it is maybe a neighbor wrote the racially charged message.

The Weld, Morgan, and Logan County, Colorado law definition of Bias-Motivated Crimes – C.R.S. 18-9-121 – is: A person commits a bias-motivated crime if, with the intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person’s actual or perceived race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, physical or mental disability, or sexual orientation, he or she: (a) Knowingly causes bodily injury to another person; or (b) By words or conduct, knowingly places another person in fear of imminent lawless action directed at that person or that person’s property and such words or conduct are likely to produce bodily injury to that person or damage to that person’s property; or (c) Knowingly causes damage to or destruction of the property of another person. Because the term written on the man’s door is a racial slur, it could be argued the intent of the person who wrote it was to harass the man based on his race. This was done through property damage.

175,175,"Jon Lester, the British-born teenager that was convicted of attacking several Black men in a racially motivated attack in 1986, committed sucide in his hometown of Manchester, England, according to reports. Lester was convicted of a hate crime for the death of Michael Griffith, a 23 year old Black male who was killed when he was struck by a car on the Belt Parkway after running from Lester and the group of attackers. “Kill the n—–s,” Lester allegedly yelled as he and the teens he rounded up ambushed the victims. The white teens brutally assaulted Griffith’s stepfather, 36-year-old Cedric Sandiford, pounding him with a baseball bat, a tire iron and tree branches. The crime ignited the city’s already simmering racial tensions. The Rev. Al Sharpton led marches through Howard Beach and was cursed by local whites. Mayor Ed Koch likened the killing to a lynching. “This incident can only be described as rivaling the kind of lynching party that existed in the Deep South,” Koch said. Lester was convicted of manslaughter and assault for his role in Griffith’s death. He was sentenced in 1988 to 10 to 30 years in prison. Lester showed “no remorse, no sense of guilt, no shame, no fear,” Justice Thomas Demakos said at his sentencing. 15 years later in 2001, Lester never escaped his demons. He was sent back to his Manchester hometown, but never fully recovered from his time behind bars. Lester leaves behind a wife and three children.",1,0,0

SPONSORED The men charged and arrested are Dusty Leo, 27, and Maurice Diggins, 34. According to court documents the defendant was minding his own business when Leo and Diggings approached him in a pickup truck. The two men allegedly broke his jaw and yelled racial slurs at him. They beat the victim to the pavement and he got up and ran for his life. Mills said this was a crime rooted in hate. “All Mainers should be shocked by this brutal race-based assault,” Mills said. “This attack has shattered the victim’s sense of safety.

We filed this action to protect not simply this victim but any person of color who might be targeted by these defendants.” Both men have a criminal background.

Gerald Sloane Wallace pleaded guilty to one account of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs by leaving a voicemail with the Masjid Mosque in Miami Gardens on Feb. 19. He allegedly threatened to shoot members of the mosque’s congregation, according to The Associated Press. “I hate you Muslims, you Muslims are terrible. I hate you people,” Wallace said in the voicemail, according to the Miami Herald. “I’m gonna go down to your center, I’m gonna shoot all ya’ll. … I hate your Allah, I hate your Koran, I hate everything about Islam.” Wallace’s charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in jail. Wallace, who worked as a security guard at a grocery store, told prosecutors that he left similar messages with mosques in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, and had done so out of an “absolute hatred” toward Muslims in the U.S. after the Sep. 11 terrorist attacks, according to the Miami Herald. Prosecutors sought to have Wallace detained, as they believed he posed a threat to members of the mosques he targeted. “Wallace said that he calls and emails these mosques because he hates Muslims and has thought about killing them,” prosecutors said in a June court motion. “He believes that all Muslims must leave the United States, whether voluntarily or by force.” Authorities set Wallace’s sentencing for Jan. 17.

Police are also searching for the suspects involved in what Newsham said seems to be an unprovoked attack in D.C.s U Street neighborhood. WASHINGTON — D.C. police are still looking for the suspects involved in what Chief Peter Newsham said seems like an unprovoked attack on two men in the U Street neighborhood. Newsham acknowledged the city’s troubling rise in hate crimes over the last few years. “There has been increases in hate crimes in the city from ’15 to ’16 and ’16 to ’17,” he said of the recent year rise. “It’s hard to say exactly what the increase is due to.” D.C. reported 66 hate crimes in 2015 and 107 in 2016. D.C. hate crime statistics have not been updated yet for 2017. “I think one of the things to note about the hate crimes is most of the increases in our hate crimes are against property and not necessarily against persons,” Newsham clarified. The department released video of three suspects kicking two men in the street just blocks from the U Street Metro Sunday morning, but Special Liason Unit investigators haven’t determined whether it was a hate crime. Police are offering a reward of up to $1,000 for a tip that leads to a conviction. It took place around 12:05 a.m. on 10th and U streets Northwest. “For this particular case, we have information to suggest that some homophobic slurs were used during the course of the assault,” Newsham said. “If it is a hate crime, we’ll bring that charge once we bring the person into custody.” Like WTOP on Facebook and follow @WTOP on Twitter to engage in conversation about this article and others. © 2018 WTOP.

184,184,"It was cold and pouring rain outside when a woman stepped up to the podium and spoke to members of San Luis Coastal Unified School Districts school board March 13. Her husband stood silent behind her. My son is not a threat, and my son has been threatened, she told them. click to enlarge Photo By Jayson Mellom SPEAKING OUT Twelve speakers showed up to the March 13 San Luis Coastal Unified School District board meeting to voice their concerns about bullying in the wake of a hate crime arrest at SLO High School earlier this month. Since the beginning of the month, the woman and her family have been at the center of public discussion and concern in connection with the arrest of an unknown SLO High School student accused of bullying and threatening her son. The suspect, who police have declined to identify because he is a minor, was arrested March 1 on a felony hate crime charge. According the SLO Police Department, the unnamed suspect had allegedly been bullying the 15-year-old autistic student since the beginning of the school year. That bullying included sending him threatening and derogatory text messages related to his autism and perceived sexual orientation. The same student also allegedly threatened to physically assault him, and police said their investigation later revealed there was a physical altercation involving the juvenile suspect and the victim in late February. At the March 13 board meeting, the students mother expressed frustration with the fact that the harassment and violence against her son was allowed to go on for such a long period of time, and only ended when law enforcement intervened. I was told he was going to be safe, she said. But it took the student being arrested by the SLOPD. ... I dont think you guys have taken this as seriously as they have. According to the California Healthy Kids Survey for the 2015-16 school year, 29 percent of ninth grade respondents and 28 percent of 11th grade respondents in the San Luis district reported that theyd been made fun of because of their race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or physical or mental disability. Those numbers are just slightly higher than survey results for the same year at the county level. The hate crime incident wasnt troubling only to the victims family. The facts of case alarmed a number of community activists and organizations, particularly those who advocate for autism and LGBTQ-related issues. Dr. Debra Balke is the president of the Central Coast Autism Spectrum Center board of directors. She said that while many autistic children are very capable and can be successful in the classroom, they can also be singled out for harassment. So many are good students, but oftentimes they are perceived as different, and they are targeted for bullying, Balke told New Times. [The bullying of autistic students] may be even less reported than others, and I think it is more common than we understand. Balke said that more staff training and student education could help schools foster understanding and supportive environments for autistic students. Local advocates for the LGBTQ community know about the dangers of bullying all too well. Representatives for several such groups attended the school board meeting. Our organizations were shocked by the hate crime arrest, said Doug Heumann, who spoke on behalf of multiple organizations, including the Gay and Lesbian Alliance of the Central Coast, Tranz Central Coast, and the Central Coast Coalition for inclusive schools. This isnt the first time the groups have raised concerns about the bullying of LGBTQ students at SLO High School. A March 13 letter to the school board authored by all three organizations mentioned an incident in May of last year, when one of the schools teachers penned a letter in the high schools student newspaper citing a Bible passage that appeared to indicate that LGBTQ students deserved to die. The teacher later resigned. Heumann said that the group sent a letter to the district in June offering to help create a safer and more supportive learning environment for students, but he said the district never responded. We believe there is a pattern of inaction or ineffective action by the district, the March 13 letter to the school board stated. At the meeting, school board President Chris Ungar said the district could not discuss the specifics of the case, but said he understood the publics desire to know more information about what happened. Providing a safe environment for students and staff continues to be a district priority, Ungar said. At the same meeting, the board voted to approve a resolution affirming the districts commitment to maintaining safe schools. While the resolution focused on emergency planning, drills, and cooperation with law enforcement to curb school violence, the resolution also stated that the district will continue to work with a broad spectrum of local community stakeholders to develop and implement policies and programs to foster a school climate free from harassment and violence. While the district works to respond to the concerns of the community, SLOPD officials are urging citizens to report suspected hate crimes. We encourage people to come forward and report these incidents, SLO Police officer Josh Walsh told attendees at the board meeting.

185,185,"Zachary Degraw (Photo: Courtesy Benton County Jail) A Willmar man has been charged with bias-motivated assault after a Somali cab driver said he was choked by a passenger while driving from downtown St. Cloud to a bar east of the city. Zachary Todd Degraw, 23, was in Benton County District Court this week to face charges of assault motivated by bias, a gross misdemeanor, and two counts of misdemeanor fifth-degree assault. The alleged assault was reported to have happened early March 25 when the cab driver picked up Degraw and a woman in St. Cloud. He was driving them to Rollies Rednecks & Longnecks bar east of St. Cloud when Degraw, who was seated in the back seat of the cab, put his arm around the cab drivers neck and began to choke him, according to a criminal complaint charging him. The cab driver was unable to breathe or call his dispatcher and had difficulty keeping his cab in the traffic lane. The cab swerved from side to side on Minnesota Highway 23 until the driver slammed on the brakes, stopping the cab as it was pointed to the ditch. Degraw released his hold on the driver, who then called for help, according to the account in the court document. The woman in the cab with Degraw told deputies that the defendant was racist, according to the complaint. She told deputies that Degraw attacked and choked the driver, according to the complaint. When investigators asked Degraw what happened, he told them he believed that the cab driver was going to call some of his friends. When investigators told him that didnt make sense, he said he thought the driver was going to call someone within his own race. Degraw was questioned more about that statement and told investigators Well, he is Muslim. Degraw denied choking the cab driver. Then he asked investigators a question. You tell me, do you not know what these Muslims will do with a white American girl? the complaint quotes him as saying. He also asked a deputy if he trusted Muslims and told that deputy a story about how he had been wronged by a Muslim in the past. Degraws attorney Robert Stoneburner said Degraw said he and his client will seek to have the charge dismissed at a May 4 pretrial hearing. If dismissal is denied, Degraw will likely plead not guilty, Stoneburner said. The Paynesville attorney said he does not believe the incident was bias motivated. I have known Mr. Degraw for some time and he is not a racist or biased person, he said. He has no ill will towards minorities and alcohol was likely a contributing factor in this event.

188,188,"A community is searching for answers after a group of young people allegedly attacked a biracial boy in an incident being investigated as a hate crime . According to the Valley News , an 8-year-old boy in Claremont, New Hampshire, is recovering after a group of teens allegedly pushed him off a picnic table with a rope around his neck last month, in what some have called a near lynching . Lorrie Slattery, the boys grandmother, told the Valley News on September 5 that the boy suffered cuts and rope burns on his neck, and that he was airlifted to a nearby hospital. He did not sustain any internal injuries, according to the Valley News , and has since been released. Lorrie told the Valley News that the teens had taunted her grandson using racial slurs, and threw sticks and rocks at him. Soon after, Lorrie said the teens grabbed a nearby rope that was holding a tire swing. The rope ended up around her grandsons neck ( Valley News points out it isnt immediately clear how it got there), and he was pushed off the table. “The [teenagers] said, ‘Look at this,’ supposedly putting the rope around their necks,” she told the Valley News. “One boy said to [her grandson], ‘Let’s do this,’ and then pushed him off the picnic table and hung him.” According to another report from the Valley News on September 8, Claremont city manager Ryan McNutt referred to the case as an unfortunate incident between some juveniles. Police have stayed mum about the investigation so far, as the only witnesses are juveniles, only confirming to Boston.com on September 11 that the incident, which reportedly happened on August 28, is being investigated as a hate crime. “I would hope that the community in Claremont would see this as an opportunity to begin some really potentially uncomfortable conversations about realities of race and racism,” Fran Brokaw, a member of the group Showing Up for Racial Justice, told the Valley News . Mark Hughes, the co-founder and executive director for the racial justice group Justice for All, told Valley News that these kinds of incidents should be consistently shared with the public and pointed out that this particular one didnt become public until the boys mother posted about it on Facebook, and her post was widely circulated. He also said its important to note that this alleged hate crime happened in 2017. And yet, its not an isolated issue. According to The Washington Post , a lawmaker called for the lynching of people who supported the dismantling of Confederate monuments in May; that same month, CNN reported bananas were found hanging from nooses on American Universitys campus just after the schools first ever black female student government president was elected to office.

195,195,"About 15 percent of Scots are Catholic . The MSP raised this subject in Parliament in the third week of March, after a Catholic church located near the city of Glasgow was vandalized. The Blessed Sacrament was desecrated. Statistics collated from Scottish Government records reveal that Catholics make up a lion’s share of the victims when it comes to religious-aggravated offenses in Scotland. It is clear that Scottish Roman Catholics require increased protection to fight hate crimes. MSP Smith asked that equal prominence be given to anti-Catholicism as it has been given to anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. She made the comments after reports emerged that Cardinal Keith O’Brien had died after he suffered a fall. O’Brien, who at one time led Catholics in Scotland, was compelled to resign after it was alleged that he had engaged in inappropriate conduct. The fall resulted in a collarbone break and a head injury. The Cardinal died due to these injuries. It is the belief of church leaders that such anti-Catholic sentiment is due to the 1560 Scottish Protestant Revolution. The 16th-century event led to the denunciation of Catholic worship and doctrine. Many Scottish Catholics believe discrimination against Catholics continues to this day. Matt McGlone, an author and journalist, concurs. He said that Scotland has rampant sectarianism. He pointed out that the problem is particularly prevalent in Scotland’s western part, although the anti-Catholic mentality is found all over Scotland. Daniel Harkins of the Scottish Catholic Observer agrees. The newspaper editor said, “last month we reported on 15 employees of a local authority who had complained to their union of anti-Catholic discrimination by their supervisor — a convicted bigot. Our evidence is anecdotal, not statistical, but it has always been difficult to accurately measure levels of anti-Catholicism in Scotland.” Smith requested the incumbent Scottish National Party to “go out to the Catholic population and listen to their concerns.” In response, Annabelle Ewing of the SNP said that the present administration has committed to manage such crimes. She said that about £13 million has been spent since 2012 to curtail sectarianism. Smith, in her reply, quoted the Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia, who said sectarianism is not much of a problem, but antipathy towards Catholicism is. A study made in 2015 by Social Attitudes Survey revealed that 15 percent of Scots identify themselves as Catholic.

There is still a lot of work left to do, says Elmer Hitt, the director of police and fire service in the city of Jackson. FBI Public Relations Officer Timothy Wiley added that the Ann Arbor Resident Agency of the Detroit Field Office of the FBI is providing assistance to the Jackson Police Department in attempting to confirm whether this was, in fact, a hate-violence incident. Hitt added that an accelerant had been used to grow the fire and that detection dogs were employed following reports about the smell of kerosene at the scene. Joly was bringing Moores lunch to her workplace when the fire began. The couples two German shepherds and three cats died in the house. Most of their neighbors absolutely loved them and adored them, said Karyl Baker, a close friend of the couple. If this is arson, we dont think this is the end of it by any means. No arrests have been made yet and police are cautioning locals about jumping to conclusions.

We have offered any and all assistance that EQMI can provide to Nikki and Chris, said Nathan Triplett, EQMIs director of public policy and political action. The high-profile role that Nikki and Chris have played in pro-equality efforts in Jackson in recent months and the proximity of this suspicious fire to Jacksons first-ever pride festival raise serious concerns about the possibility that this may have been a hate crime, Triplett continued. Equality Michigan has been in touch with officials in Jackson and law enforcement and will continue to monitor the investigation closely as it proceeds.

The federal indictment includes hate crimes charges, cyberstalking, and making threats against the Israeli embassy, among other charges. Kadar, who is Jewish, was arrested in Israel last March in a joint operation involving Israeli law enforcement officials and the FBI. He is currently awaiting trial in the Zionist entity where he also faces a number of other charges, including publishing false information, computer hacking, and money laundering. The recent federal indictment does not indicate whether or not Kadar would be extradited to the U.S. to face trial for his crimes here. Israel rarely allows its citizens to be extradited to face trial in foreign countries, even if they have dual citizenship. Federal grand juries in Florida, Georgia, and the District of Columbia brought the federal indictment against Kadar for making fake threats between January and March 2017, it was reported. The fake bomb threats allegedly made by Kadar against JCCs, Jewish schools, and other Jewish institutions across the country last year generated major headlines and much controversy. At the time, many Jewish institutions were evacuated and the Jewish community and countless U.S. politicians, including President Donald Trump, railed against the supposed resurgence in anti-Semitism, which turned out to be entirely manufactured by Kadar’s fake bomb threats. “The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,” Trump stated in late February of last year. Other political leaders made similar statements, hyping the alleged threat of anti-Semitism, bigotry, and racially inspired violence. The American Jewish Committee published an open letter to Trump shortly after the threats began generating headlines, demanding that the president “condemn what has often been described as ‘the oldest hatred’—anti-Semitism—and [to] unleash the power of government to match deeds with words.” No bombs were ever found at any of the JCCs and other Jewish institutions toward which Kadar had purportedly made threats, yet that did not stop Jewish groups from demanding more federal funding and protection. Jewish institutions increased their private security services in the wake of the fake bomb threats and used the threats to hysterically hype the alleged threat of anti-Semitism. David Posner, the director of strategic performance of the JCC Association of North America, stated at the time that his organization was “relieved that all such threats have proven to be hoaxes and that not a single person was harmed,” yet he nevertheless was “concerned about the anti-Semitism behind these threats, and the repetition of threats intended to interfere with day-to-day life.” The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), one of the most subversive organizations operating on American soil today, praised the recent federal indictment brought against Kadar. “Make no mistake, these threats were acts of anti-Semitism and deserve to be treated as a hate crime,” the ADL’s CEO Jona than Greenblatt stated in a press release following the announcement of the federal indictment. “They targeted Jewish institutions in order to stoke fear and anxiety and put the entire Jewish community on high alert.” Unsurprisingly, Greenblatt, like other Jewish leaders and U.S. politicians commenting on the case, failed to mention that Kadar is himself Jewish and holds dual Israeli-American citizenship. “We applaud the diligent investigative work of the FBI, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the state and local law enforcement officials who made this investigation a high priority,” Greenblatt continued. “We especially appreciate the fact that these federal charges recognize that these threats constituted crimes—and we welcome the strong statements by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray recognizing the deep impact of hate violence. We again call on Congress to enact legislation to expand federal protections against bomb threats to religious institutions. The House of Representatives approved their version of this measure in December and now the Senate must act without hesitation.” The ADL recently released a new report documenting what it considers to be anti-Semitic incidents in the United States during 2017, which include the fake threats purportedly made by Kadar. The report details 1,986 supposed anti-Semitic incidents, a 57% increase in such incidents as compared to 2016. The ADL and other Jewish organizations regularly hype the supposed threat of anti-Semitism and “hate” in order to advance political narratives beneficial to the organized Jewish community, which include lobbying for legislation cracking down on “hate speech” and criticism of Jews and other minorities more generally. As this newspaper has reported on extensively, the vast majority of so-called “hate crimes” are manufactured by the victims themselves in order to advance and perpetuate a victimhood narrative and exaggerate the “threat” of anti-Semitism and racism in American society. According to reports, it is unclear how many hoax threats Kadar made, but some estimate he called close to 2,000 institutions around the world. In 2017, approximately 100 Jewish institutions in the U.S. received bomb threats, a fraction of the total number of bomb threats that other institutions in the U.S. face every year. According to the Educator’s School Safety Network (ESSN), a national non-profit school safety organization, that in 2016 1,267 bomb threats were reported by schools around the U.S. Following the recent massacre at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in February, schools across the U.S. have reported dozens of threats that have included bomb hoaxes.

The Onslow County Sheriff’s Office took Brandon Ray Davis, 30, into custody on March 1. He is awaiting extradition to Key West where he faces a felony charge of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. According to a police report, Kevin Seymour and Kevin Price were riding bicycles on Duval Street when they spotted Davis driving erratically on a scooter. When the men alerted Davis he had almost hit a vehicle, Davis launched into a tirade against the men, calling them “fags” and knocking Seymour to the ground. Davis allegedly attempted to justify this behavior by announcing, “you live in Trump country now.” Also Davis, allegedly told Seymour “I’ll cut you up” if he contacted the police. Detectives with the Key West Police Department were able to identify Davis partly through the scooter rental agency where he left a copy of his driver’s license. The victims noted the scooter’s license plate before the suspect fled the scene. As to the hate crime charge, cops believe “probable cause exists to believe there was evidence of prejudice in Davis’ attack of Seymour,” said Alyson Crean, public information officer for the Key West Police Department. “(Davis) used explicit bias language in reference to their sexual orientation. Davis then attacked Seymour without any provocation.” The Jacksonville (N.C.) Daily News reports Davis is fighting extradition and out of jail on a $10,000 bond.",1,4,0

Incidents of bias and hate that occur on a smaller scale, often involving only one or two people, are not as well reported.

James reacted to the incident Wednesday afternoon saying it was an opportunity once again to shed the light and keep the conversation going, even though James admitted he and his family were having to bear some of the burden in that it will be a difficult discussion to have with his children and had impacted his normally vibrant demeanor. The reality is, its a constant reminder of the progress that still needs to be made. No matter how much money you have… no matter how famous you are… being black in America... it’s tough, James said. The most recent data provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation indicates there were nearly 6,000 hate related incidents in 2015, effecting approximately 7,000 victims.

212,212,"CHICAGO, IL — The City of Chicago and the head of the Chicago Police Department have asked a judge to block a Glenview man from a list of potential police officers eligible to attend the academy. In a petition filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson asked a judge to review a decision by Chicagos Human Resources Board to allow Patrick Lavin, a 27-year-old Glenview resident, to be hired as a probationary Chicago police officer, citing a 2011 arrest. Lavin was charged with felony aggravated battery, battery and a hate crime after a fight outside a bar in Carbondale in 2011. He said the group of people he was with got into an argument over who a taxicab belonged to, which escalated into a shoving match and an eventual exchange of blows, according to the filing. Court records show the felony charges were dropped and the incident was expunged from Lavins record after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery. (Sign up for our free daily newsletters and breaking news alerts for the Glenview Patch.) Lavin was initially charged with a hate crime because one of the people involved was gay, although he said he never knew the sexual orientation of anyone involved, according to a report by a hearing officer of the Human Resources board. He was sentenced to an anger management evaluation and a year of court supervision, the Chicago Tribune reported. But Johnson and lawyers representing the city argue the facts disqualify Lavin from being eligible to serve as a probationary officer. CPD policy states that if there is evidence that the applicant has engaged in criminal conduct, even if the applicant was never convicted of any criminal offense, then the applicant should be disqualified from consideration, the filing said. Lavin challenged his disqualification, and on March 6 an administrative hearing officer agreed with him that Chicagos lawyers had failed to prove that he had engaged in conduct constituting a felony. Mondays filing seeks to overturn that ruling. Lavin could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

213,213,"A crowd chants, We shall overcome, at a march against racism in Claremont, New Hampshire, following reports that teenagers there attempted to lynch an 8-year-old boy. Credit: James M. Patterson/The Valley News via AP i In this week’s Hate Report: A mother says kids tried to lynch her son in New Hampshire, Congress presses President Donald Trump to do more about white supremacists and the Proud Boys face an identity crisis. The Hate Report has been pretty consumed with big stories recently, from the deadly hate-fueled attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, to the extremist activities of the anti-fascist movement. So this week, we want to get back to one of the original reasons why we began this project: detailing individual hate incidents across the country. While details still are trickling out, news organizations have reported that an 8-year-old biracial boy was heckled with racial slurs by a group of teenagers, who then tied a rope around his neck and pushed him off a picnic table in Claremont, New Hampshire. The story came to light when the boy’s mother posted a gruesome picture of her son’s neck on Facebook, along with a message: It truly saddens me that even in a city so small, racism exists. My son used to love being able to go to the park with his older sister and shoot some hoops! Now, he’s not even allowed to go outside without me. It (sic) sad that in a city we considered to be safe, we aren’t safe at all. The boy was taken to hospital but soon was released. The New York Times reports that the incident is being investigated as a possible hate crime. The alleged attack sparked outrage among residents of the city of about 13,000 people, and about 100 people showed up at a Claremont park Tuesday night for a vigil, NHPR reported. The vigil was interrupted by a man driving past in a truck, who shouted, “All lives matter,” responding to “Black Lives Matter” signs in the crowd, according to NHPR. The man also yelled, “Stop making it about race.” This is only the latest high-profile, apparently racially charged hate incident involving a minor to make headlines recently. Earlier this year, BuzzFeed News reported that children are invoking the name of President Donald Trump to bully classmates about their race or religion. BuzzFeed has confirmed more than 50 incidents since the election, across 26 states. While there is no evidence that the teenagers in Claremont invoked Trump’s name, the president’s apparent reluctance to speak out against hate groups clearly has been high on the minds of one group: the U.S. Congress. Congress urges Trump to denounce hate Congress unanimously passed a joint resolution this week condemning white supremacy and labeling the car attack in Charlottesville as domestic terror. Under the resolution, Congress said it “rejects White nationalism, White supremacy, and neo-Nazism as hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States.” It urged Trump to “speak out against hate groups that espouse racism, extremism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and White supremacy; and use all resources available to the President and the President’s Cabinet to address the growing prevalence of those hate groups in the United States.” The resolution called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to work with the Department of Homeland Security to “investigate thoroughly all acts of violence, intimidation, and domestic terrorism by White supremacists, White nationalists, neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan … and to prevent those groups from fomenting and facilitating additional violence.” However, Sessions has a long history of failing to prioritize crimes against minorities. During his stint as a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, Sessions once reportedly said of civil rights cases that crossed his desk, “I wish I could decline on all of them.” The Trump administration also has pulled homeland security grants funding nonprofit organizations attempting to combat white supremacist extremism. Speaking on the far-right web radio show “Fash the Nation” in July, white supremacist podcast host Michael Peinovich, who also goes by the pen name Mike Enoch, said the Trump administration’s deprioritization of such violence is “going to give us space to operate, and frankly, it is space to destroy.” Trump signed the resolution Thursday. However, he kept the furor going over his Charlottesville response, again telling reporters that “both sides” were to blame for the violence. Who’s proud to be a Proud Boy? In the aftermath of the hurricanes that slammed the Gulf Coast in recent weeks, the Proud Boys were there to help. The self-proclaimed “politically incorrect” men’s group, created to celebrate European culture, sent members from the across the country to serve as an “anti-looting patrol” after Hurricane Harvey in Texas and deliver supplies to people stranded by Hurricane Irma in Florida. The disaster relief efforts come as the group is attempting to put some distance between itself and the larger “alt-right” label that’s increasingly being viewed as a synonym for white supremacy. In an email exchange, Pawl Bazile, an editor at Proud Boys Magazine, said any Proud Boy who had joined the white supremacist Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville had been kicked out of the group. However, he did not respond to a request to provide evidence that this purge actually occurred. “We are not Alt Right,” he wrote. “We want nothing to do with White Nationalists, the Klan, Neo Nazis, or even your run of the mill racist (sic) cause it tends be off put our many non-white members and is boring.” Despite the Proud Boys’ insistence on their good intentions in these relief efforts, their work drew criticism. “The best critique they could come up with was ‘they had guns,’ ” Bazile wrote, dismissing the critique as ridiculous. “Yes, could you imagine … guns … in Texas. Crazy stuff right there.” Bazile said he would put us in touch with someone directly involved in the relief once Reveal did a story about violence committed by the antifa. Since we already had, we sent this article. He never responded. This rebranding was complicated by reports from a protest in Vancouver, Washington, over the weekend, where supporters of Oregon-based conservative agitator Joey Gibson clashed with antifa counterprotesters. During the event, a car full of Proud Boys allegedly sprayed pepper spray at counterprotesters, who threw rocks at the vehicle as it drove away. A hate crime widow fights deportation In the days after Sunayana Dumala’s husband was gunned down in an Kansas restaurant by a man who yelled racial slurs before opening fire, she faced deportation. Dumala, who has lived in the U.S. since 2012, was applying for a green card through her husband’s H-1B visa, but that process was disrupted by his killing. When U.S. Rep. Kevin Yoder, R-Kansas, heard about Dumala’s situation, he was “apoplectic,” reports The Kansas City Star. “We are not going to deport the widow of the victim of a hate crime,” he said. Yoder, who is sponsoring a bill aimed at helping high-skilled immigrants gain permanent resident status, helped Dumala secure a one-year visa to continue living in the U.S., at least temporarily. She joined the congressman in Washington for an event this month pushing for the legislation’s passage. “I’m very fortunate that many people came to my rescue to get me back on a temporary status … and are continuing to work on a permanent fix,” Dumala wrote in an email to The Star.

The suspect, Jeremy Joseph Christian, has shared social media posts promoting Nazism, political violence and Trump, according to the Associated Press. Though the FBI said it’s too early to determine whether the attack qualifies as a federal hate crime, Christian faces intimidation charges—Oregon’s equivalent. The incident sparked outrage and heartbreak across the country, but it drew no comment from the president until three days after the fact. Trump’s lack of response to the killings drew criticism, particularly since he sent out a stream of tweets on Sunday upon returning from his first official international trip. Those messages focused instead on the “fake news media,” which he called “the enemy,” and on the Montana congressional race won last week by a Republican candidate who assaulted a reporter the night before the election.

215,215,"David Harris found guilty for the hate-crime murder of Onesimo Lopez in Jupiter in 2015. (WPEC) A jury on Tuesday found a Jupiter man guilty of first-degree murder in a high-profile hate crime killing. Jurors deliberated less than four hours before declaring David Harris guilty of the brutal fatal attack on 18-year-old Onesimo Lopez, a Guatemalan man. The judge immediately sentenced Harris to life in prison. Harris showed little emotion as the clerk read the verdict. The day before, on the witness stand, Harris acknowledged his friend Austin Taggart was with him and going “Guat hunting,” or looking for vulnerable Guatemalans to rob. Harris claimed self-defense when he swung an ax at Lopez and blamed Taggart for killing Lopez with a rock. However, prosecutors said it was Harris’ blow with the blunt end of the ax that killed him. “I think he’s in shock,” said Franklin Prince, Harris’s attorney who promised an appeal. “It’s really hard to tell your story (in) police interrogations, when they’re not really listening to you,” Prince said. The jury also convicted Harris in the hate crime assault on another man the same night three years ago in Jupiter. With a first-degree murder conviction, state law calls for an automatic life sentence. Judge Samantha Schosberg-Feuer used the words “heinous” and “horrific” to describe the crime as she pronounced Harris’ punishment. “I am glad we live in a community that’s not going to tolerate this kind of behavior,” said Suzanne Cordero, incoming director of El Sol, the Jupiter day labor and community resource center. Cordero said she feels justice was done. “We still have a lot of work to do, you know, here in El Sol... outside in the community, in our schools,” Cordero said. “Bullying unfortunately we’re still dealing with it.” Prosecutor Jill Richstone would only say she was pleased to achieve justice for Lopez.

217,217,"A community shaken by a recent shooting of a Sikh man came together at a downtown Kent church on Saturday in a show of solidarity against hatred and violence. City, regional and state leaders from law enforcement, the Legislature, school, civic and faith circles joined area Sikh faithful at a packed Kent Lutheran Church to denounce the hate crime and encourage more understanding and unity among ethnic groups and their neighborhoods. The two-hour community rally included song, prayer and guest speakers, each expressing their support for the Kent community in wake of the shooting. “Each of us has a job to do to help make this a home where people feel that they want to be, where they feel safe, where they feel connected, where they have hope and a future,” Kent Mayor Suzette Cooke challenged the crowd. “Not one incident will change the course for us. … The motto for Kent is bringing the world home.” Kent, a growing and diverse city, has received unwanted national attention after a 39-year-old Sikh man was shot in the arm in front of his East Hill home on March 3. The victim, Deep Rai, told Kent Police he was working on his vehicle in the driveway at about 8 p.m. when a stranger approached him, saying, “Go back to your own country.” There was a physical altercation that led to the suspect shooting Rai in the arm before fleeing on foot, police said. Rai, a U.S. citizen who is originally from India’s Punjab state, is recovering from the wound. Authorities are investigating the shooting as a hate crime. The suspect was last described as a white male, 6 feet tall, with a medium build, dark hoodie, dark clothing, and a mask covering the lower part of his face. The victim was only able to provide these details to describe his attacker, authorities said. Kent Police Cheif Ken Thomas assured the crowd at Saturday’s rally that everything is being done to find the perpetrator. Neighboring law enforcement and federal agencies are bolstering efforts in the manhunt, Thomas said. “We continue to work hard,” Thomas said. “I can’t tell you a lot about the investigation other than we continue to work hard. We continue to make progress. (Friday) last night, 35 FBI agents and detectives from throughout the region were re-canvassing the East Hill area.” The shooting has galvanized the community. Saturday’s rally echoed those feelings. “I don’t want an incident of violence to be the reason we share stories with one another. That isn’t the reason we want to get to know each other, the reason we want to share communities together,” said Jane Prestbye, lead pastor of Kent Lutheran Church. “(But) we need to love your neighbor, serve your neighbor, know your neighbor and listen to your neighbor.” Other leaders chimed in. “You are proof positive that you are no longer quiet … to let the world know this is not OK,” said Auburn Mayor Nancy Backus. “We are here, we love our neighbors and will continue to love our neighbors. … In times like this it is so heartwarming to see us working together.” Added state Sen. Karen Keiser, D-Des Moines: “We are at a place where you need to have faith over fear and love over hate. Hate is among us and we must treat it, in my opinion, as a public health menace. It is contagious. It must be contained. It has to be isolated.” State Rep. Pat Sullivan, D-Covington, has raised a family here. “I was devastated. How could that kind of violence and hatred happen in our community? How could it happen right here in Kent?” he told the gathering. “We have two choices. We can ignore it and go on with our business as if nothing happened, or we can stand together as a community against hatred and violence, and that is what we are doing here today. By you showing up, you are saying that hatred and violence does not belong in South King County.” Sikh community leaders remain steadfast in working together with others in the community. “We have to define what America is. You coming together puts that definition together,” said Jasmit Singh, a Seattle-area Sikh community leader. “We are not going to fear anyone. … and I do not look at anyone as the enemy. “We have to be able to stand together, shoulder to shoulder … to know your neighbor and stand up against the violence.” The FBI is offering a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to the successful resolution of the assault case, with racially motivated actions. Anyone with information that can help identify the individual is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477) or the Kent Police tip line 253-856-5808.

220,220,"Ajaz Mahmood A father whose home was targeted by someone who threw a pigs head through a window in an apparent anti-Muslim hate crime has said his children have been asking difficult questions about why their family was singled out. The severed head narrowly missed the two children, who were in the living room when a man hurled part of a concrete slab through the window of the home in Oldham, Greater Manchester, before throwing the head in after it. Although no one was injured, the family, who are Muslim, have been left shaken by the incident, which happened at about 10pm on Saturday. Ajaz Mahmood told BuzzFeed News he was at work at the restaurant he runs when he received a phone call from his wife, Ghazala Kauser, who he said was hysterical. After she told him the news, he said he jumped into his car and drove the short journey home. She was screaming, hysterical. I had to calm her down, he said. She said somebody smashed the window. I put the phone down and raced home. I only realised when I got into my front room there was a pigs head there, wedged between the arms of the sofa, wrapped in plastic. I thought it was absolutely disgusting. His son Hammas, 14, and his 6-year-old daughter Zeina were in the room at the time. Hammas was playing on the PlayStation, while his sister was sitting on the sofa when what police said was a brick and the animals head came flying through the window. Ajaz Mahmood My son and my daughter, shes only 6 years old, they were upset, he said. They were frightened when the glass smashed and the concrete slab was thrown through the house, then the pigs head. Im really shocked. My kids are my main priority, he added, saying he couldnt think of any reason why he had been targeted. I cant think of a reason at all. Im just a normal bloke who just goes to work, tries to look after his family. Ive not got any enemies, Im not overly religious. Im shocked that somebody could throw a concrete slab – that could have hurt somebody really badly, knowing there could have been children in the house. That made me even more angry. People had not thought about the fact that there were kids there. He also said the incident had led to his children asking uncomfortable questions about why the family had been targeted. My daughter is only a child, she doesnt understand whats gone on, he said. Shes asking questions – why the window has been smashed, why that head has been thrown through. Theyre both asking questions. How do you explain that to a 6-year-old? What do you say to them? I told them theyre just mindless people that have done that. Ajaz Mahmood Mahmood said he now feels uncomfortable about leaving his family at home alone when he goes out to work. When youre at work, when your kids and wife are at home, you feel vulnerable, he added. Mahmood, who was born in Yorkshire, has lived in Oldham for almost three decades, and in the same house for the past 11 years without incident. Ive never had an incident in that area. Weve lived in the area for 28, 29 years, he said. We had incidents in the late 80s, got the odd racial abuse, lads used to come from the estate and smashed a couple of windows, but after a few months it died away. Were in 2017; nobody tolerates that rubbish any more. He said he had been heartened by the response from friends, relatives, and the local community, and had received a phone call from his sons headteacher, offering his support. Police are treating the attack as a suspected hate crime. Between April and June this year there were 2,758 hate crimes and incidents reported to police in Greater Manchester. Race and/or religion was listed as a factor in 2,724 of these. Fiyaz Mughal from hate crime monitoring project Tell MAMA, told BuzzFeed News: These kind of criminal acts, which blatantly target individuals because of a part of their identity, in this case their Muslim identity, leave not only short-, medium-, and long-term impacts on the victims, they also create fear among those wider individuals who may be of the same religion in that area. This hate crime in particular is extremely personal given that the pork material was thrown into somebodys house, and we would hope that any sentencing of the perpetrator is severe and significant, given the personalised nature and also the wider impact on other Muslims in the area. Ajaz Mahmood Mahmood said he was really upset that it took three hours for police to arrive at the address. They said they didnt consider it a priority, he said. Theyd been stripped of resources because of the Conservative party conference. I understand its a Saturday night, but when somebodys being attacked in their own house... I was really angry and upset, but it gets you nowhere being angry and upset. In response, a Greater Manchester police spokesperson said: Due to a number of other ongoing incidents which required an immediate response, the report had to be assessed in accordance with threat, risk, and harm posed at the time. Officers attended at the earliest opportunity to speak to the family and a full investigation is underway. Police inquiries so far have established that a Vauxhall Corsa pulled up near the house with three men inside. One of the men got out of the back seat and then threw the objects at the window, before running back to the car, which drove off. Ajaz Mahmood",1,3,2

Agustin Garcia, 19, is being held by police in connection with a... The man, Agustin Garcia, is suspected of assaulting multiple women near the intersections of San Bruno and Silver avenues, San Bruno and Arleta avenues, and San Bruno and Egbert avenues, breaking one womans nose and anothers tooth, according to San Francisco police. Once Garcia — who lives near the site of the assaults — was identified, officers learned he was already in police custody in connection with similar assaults that occurred near San Bruno and Wilde avenues in Visitacion Valley, police said Friday. All the victims were Asian women, and some were followed off Muni by Garcia, according to police. He was wearing sunglasses during some of the assaults, according to investigators. Garcia is being held on suspicion of felony assault with force likely to cause great bodily injury, battery with serious injuries, terrorist threats, attempted kidnapping, and a hate crime enhancement.

223,223,"So much for the “master race.” Federal authorities in Louisiana recently indicted eight members of a neo-Nazi gang for the 2016 killing of a fellow gang member after they inadvertently revealed plans to cover up the murder while on the phone with a 911 operator. The circumstances surrounding the shooting of Aryan Circle gang member Clifton Hallmark had raised immediate suspicions among local deputies. The victim’s wife and another woman called in the shooting of Hallmark from a gas station. But according to local ABC news affiliate KATC, during the call the 911 operator overheard the second woman tell Hallmark’s wife: “We are going to tell them he got robbed, OK?” When the police arrived, they found Hallmark with a gunshot wound to the head. He later died at the hospital. The women, who also belong to the gang, claimed that all three of them had arrived at the gas station 20 to 30 minutes earlier and, during a robbery there, Hallmark had been shot. Deputies, however, confronted the women with all the contradictory evidence, which included their accidental confession, security footage showing them placing the 911 call right after arriving at the gas station, as well as the lack of blood spatter or shell casings at the scene. After initially blaming the confusion on having taken illegal drugs and a lack of sleep, the victim’s wife eventually admitted that her husband had been shot at nearby house party where Aryan Circle members had been celebrating Independence Day. According to the Justice Department indictment, it was another Aryan Circle member, 38-year-old Jeremy Jordan, who shot Hallmark after an intra-gang dispute at the party. Seven other gang members, including Hallmark’s wife, have been charged as accessories-after-the-fact to the murder, with the accidental confession to 911 a key component of the case. The indictment also offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of one of the most violent, neo-Nazi gangs in the region. The Aryan Circle began in the Texas prison system in 1985 as an offshoot of the white supremacist gang, the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas. Since then, the Aryan Circle has expanded across the southern United States and now has an established hierarchy with six branches, including a presence in prisons in multiple states as well as a motorcycle gang. Hallmark, along with the eight people charged with his murder, all reportedly belonged to the biker gang. As the Justice Department explains, violent retribution is a common theme within the Aryan Circle. Senior members of the gang often mete out discipline within the ranks via direct orders (“D.O.”). These can range from minor punishments to physical assaults. The most serious D.O. is a Green Light, according to the Justice Department, which “means the murder of a rival gang member or of an AC member or associate who had committed an egregious violation of the gangs rules.” [Photo: Getty]",1,0,0
226,226,"Early Sunday morning, a gay man’s jaw was broken after a fight broke out in Brooklyn, New York. Police are investigating the attack as a possible hate crime. The 27-year-old victim was trying to break up a fight. That’s when the attacker called the victim an anti-homosexual slur and punched him in the face, cops said. This incident is a reminder that despite New York City being an enclave for the LGBT community, hate crimes still happen based on a person’s sexual orientation and gender identity. As NewNowNext points out, hate crimes against gay men are the most common type of hate crimes against a person in New York City. A study released in August, 2016 gives us the troubling statistics: The most frequently reported bias motivations for hate crimes against individuals were anti male homosexual (26.2%), anti-Jewish (24%) and anti-black (15.6%). Gay men (72), Jewish (66), and black (43) individuals were targeted in 181 of the 275 bias crimes against people Within the anti-sexual orientation category, male homosexual bias accounted for the majority of incidents (72 of 89). These stats are from 2015. The NYPD has yet to release information regarding 2016. Other reports recently released have shown that this year, there have already been more hate motivated homicides against LGBT people than all of 2016. That report comes from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs. The data they present shows that in 2016 there were 28 hate-violence-related homicides of LGBT people. Already this year, there have been 33 anti-LGBT hate violence murders across the country. The date from 2016 does not include the Pulse nightclub terror attack hate crime murders of 49 people. The attacker from Sunday morning’s incident in Brooklyn is still on the loose. Police released photos and video of the attacker, who’s described as black, about 5-foot-10 and 200 pounds. He wore a white tank-top and dark pants. If you have any information, please contact Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS.",1,4,0
228,228,"Nigel Garrett, 21, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for assaulting a man because of the victim’s sexual orientation, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of Texas, and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ Dallas Division announced. According to the plea agreement, Garrett admitted that he, Anthony Shelton, and Chancler Encalade used Grindr, a social media dating platform for gay men, to arrange to meet the victim at the victim’s home. Upon entering the victim’s home, the defendants restrained the victim with tape, physically assaulted the victim, and made derogatory statements to the victim for being gay. The defendants brandished a firearm during the home invasion, and they stole the victim’s property, including his motor vehicle. A federal grand jury previously had returned an eighteen-count superseding indictment, against Garrett, Shelton, Encalade and Cameron Ajiduah, that included charges for hate crimes, kidnappings, carjackings, and the use of firearms to commit violent crimes.

229,229,"The Huntley Police Department and Community School District 158 say they take juvenile electronic threats and misuse of social media very seriously. Last week, they had an opportunity to demonstrate that policy dramatically. Five criminal charges were leveled at a 13-year-old Huntley resident after an investigation into threats and racial statements made at and against Marlowe Middle School in District 158. The charges include three felonies and two misdemeanors. They include disorderly conduct (threats made to the school), a Class 4 felony; harassment by electronic communication, a Class 4 felony; hate crime, a Class 4 felony; obstructing a peace officer, a Class A misdemeanor; and disorderly conduct, a Class C misdemeanor. All of these charges were approved by the McHenry County States Attorney’s Office and filed in juvenile court, according to Huntley Deputy Police Chief Mike Klunk. The juvenile, who was a student at Marlowe when these activities took place, is currently being detained at the Kane County Juvenile Detention Center. The juvenile in this incident is not the same person that had been previously charged in regards to the reported hate crime at Marlowe in October, Klunk said. The above charges were brought as the result of a “thorough” investigation, he added. This incident was the subject of an earlier press release and a Huntley Community School District 158 community message. In a November 16 statement to District 158 families, Dr. John Burkey, superintendent, said, “Over the past several years, our district has dealt with greatly increased levels of inappropriate use of social media. This misuse includes sending threatening, bullying, and disruptive messages. These messages are harmful, they cause hurt feelings, fear, and often, serious disruptions to the school environment. We are committed to communicating as transparently as possible about these issues, especially as they pertain to student safety. “The ongoing investigation has included the execution of a search warrant, the seizure by police of pertinent items, and the conducting of numerous interviews. The location from which the message was sent and a person of interest have been identified. Out of an abundance of caution, we have increased police presence at all Huntley 158 schools (on Friday, Nov. 17). This will include uniformed officers present at Reed Road schools. “The public is reminded that comments made via electronic means have consequences,” Klunk said in a police statement. “We take matters such as this extremely seriously and will take appropriate actions to maintain the safety and well-being of our community.” The investigation revealed that threats and racial statements were made by the offender via Xbox Live, he added. The Lake in the Hills Police Department, District 158, and the McHenry County States Attorney’s Office all cooperated in the investigation of this incident, Klunk said.

230,230,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Monday, July 3, 2017 Flatbush Man Indicted for Assault as a Hate Crime for Allegedly Beating Woman Unconscious on Subway Train Faces Up To 15 Years in Prison Acting Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez announced today that a 27-year-old man has been indicted on charges of assault as a hate crime, and other offenses for allegedly punching a woman in the face and knocking her unconscious while shouting homophobic slurs on a Brooklyn-bound Q train. Acting District Attorney Gonzalez said, “Brooklyn is a model of inclusion and diversity where bias and bigotry will not be tolerated. This defendant’s alleged actions were an attack on everyone’s right to be who they are, and to love whom they choose. He will now be held accountable for this alleged attack that left a woman unconscious.” The Acting District Attorney identified the defendant as Antoine Thomas, 27, of Flatbush, Brooklyn. He was arraigned today before Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Neil Firetog on an indictment in which he is charged with second-degree assault as a hate crime, third-degree assault as a hate crime and other related offenses. He is due back in court on September 8, 2017 and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the top count. The Acting District Attorney said that, according to the investigation, on May 20, 2017, at approximately 7:30 p.m., the defendant boarded a Brooklyn-bound Q train at Union Square, and sat next to the victim and her girlfriend. The defendant, it is alleged, began shouting anti-gay slurs at the victim and her female companion regarding their sexual orientation. During the train ride the defendant continued shouting at the couple, and at one point aggressively bumped into the victim when the train made a sudden stop. The defendant then allegedly punched the victim in the face as the train arrived at the Dekalb Avenue station in Downtown Brooklyn. The defendant attempted to leave the train by walking between cars, but was arrested at the station after the conductor called the police. The unconscious victim was taken to New York Presbyterian Hospital where she was treated for a concussion, nasal fracture, a contusion and eye lacerations requiring eight stitches. The case was investigated by New York City Police Department Detective John Hidalgo and Detective Juan Espaillat of the Hate Crimes Task Force. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant District Attorney T. Peter Choi, of the District Attorney’s Civil Rights Bureau, under the supervision of Assistant District Attorney Kelli M.

233,233,"On November 14, just a few days after Donald Trumps election, Chuck Redding was driving home in Sarasota in a car with marriage equality and pride bumper stickers. Suddenly, Redding noticed a man in a Jeep Cherokee tailing him. Once Redding parked in the driveway, the bearded man jumped out, banged on Reddings window, and yanked the door open. “You know my new president says we can kill all you faggots now!” the man yelled as he dragged the 75-year-old from his car and pummeled him. Left badly bruised and with a hand swollen to twice its size, Redding called police to report the alleged hate crime. Reddings case is one of many reported across the country after Donald Trump’s election, as New Times detailed last week in a feature story produced with data from ProPublica. Now, Reddings tale is one of dozens told in a new documentary, Trumphobia, which follows the first six months of Trump’s presidency and the national spike in hate crimes that followed. Director Carolina Sosa and her team hope to examine the effects Trumps rhetoric has had on his supporters and opponents. But Sosa says her film isnt meant to demonize Trump voters — in fact, the point of the film is to create a space to understand the fear voters on both sides experienced leading up to and after the election. Sosa says as she traveled the U.S. filming the documentary, including a stop in Miami, she asked people on the street about the election results. Even in South Florida, she found a common theme among Trump supporters she interviewed: Most were unwilling to speak on-camera about why they had voted for him. “We saw that there was some sort of fear from them to express their opinion because theyre afraid of being judged,” Sosa says. In Reddings case, hes certain a fear of gay people drove his attacker. The Sarasota County police department confirmed the attack in a police report but so far have not made any arrests. Redding has been left with a hand so weak that he cant even open a bottle of soda and a wary tendency to keep an eye on his rearview mirror for cars that come too close. But Redding says hes not been cowed by the violence. “People said, ‘Well, I imagine you took off the sticker,” Redding says. “As a matter of fact, I got a bigger one.” Redding says he believes Trump has brought out the worst in Americans by exploiting divisions and encouraging violence at his rallies. He says hes seen it in his own family: His daughter, who had previously told him she didnt support his sexuality, stopped talking to him after the election. In his interview for the documentary, Redding says he wishes he could ask his attacker just one question: “What did I ever do to you?” This weekend, Redding says, he’ll attend his first-ever Pride parade in St. Petersburg, and he’ll be keeping in mind what his partner of 21 years used to tell him: Dont be stupid; be who you are. If they like you, they like you. If they dont, they dont. Its as simple as that.” Sosa and her team plan to begin editing footage for their film, which they hope to release by this fall. They’ve started a crowdfunding campaign to fund the rest of their travel, editing, and production. In the end, Sosa says, she hopes the film can heal some of the division in the country by promoting a message of empathy. Sosa thinks the best solution to the chaos that has devolved in protests across the nation is to really listen to the other persons opinions and try to understand why they think that way and work together for a negotiation of what both sides want, she says. Otherwise, its only going to be friction. ",1,4,0
235,235,"PORTLAND, Ore. — A man was arrested and charged with a hate crime after he allegedly attacked a brother and sister returning from Pride events Sunday night. The attack happened near Northwest 21st Avenue and Everett Street. “We’re walking back this way and there’s a man sitting here and he yells out a homophobic slur,” said Katelin Durnal. Durnal was with her brother and two others. The group had just finished celebrating Pride weekend and they were wearing rainbow colors. “He punched me and elbowed me in the face and I put my body weight under him and pushed him away from everybody else,” said Gregory Durnal. “During the attack he was using the word faggot, ” said Katelin. “After he punched Greg he told us to have a gay day.” The suspect, later identified as Justin Watling, took off after the attack. Officers tracked him down and arrested him. Watling is charged with second-degree intimidation for committing a hate crime, Portland police said, plus fourth-degree assault and attempt to commit a Class A misdemeanor. Court documents describe him as a transient diagnosed with schizophrenia. “I would never say this surprised me or is eye-opening,” Gregory said. “Under our current administration, this is given a louder voice to speak up and they’re happening everywhere.” © 2018 KGW",1,4,0
236,236,"An episode of golf course vandalism in Maine is being viewed as a potential hate crime. Cobbossee Colony Golf Course, located in Monmouth, Maine, was recently vandalized, with owner Bill Sylvester reporting to police Monday that somebody had left tire tracks after driving a golf cart around the course and across several greens. That’s egregious in itself, but the worst of it came at the first green. On that opening putting surface, the vandal carved a large swastika into the turf near the hole. The offensive symbol means this isn’t only a vandalism case but also one that investigates the act as a hate crime. The swastika carving is part of the estimated $2,000-3,000 of damage done by the vandalism. The investigation has turned up a few suspects, but there hasn’t been enough evidence to charge any of them. “This appears to have been teenagers who have bothered the tranquility of the neighborhood,” Monmouth Police Department Patrolman Michael Pershall said, via centralmaine.com. “I can’t make a definitive match, and I need that to bring a valid case.” The vandalism is believed to have occurred between 9:30 p.m. Eastern on Sunday and 4 a.m. on Monday and has Sylvester pondering about investing in surveillance cameras. If a person is charged for this vandalism, the investigation will be turned over to the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which typically handles hate crimes in the state. Some of the damage has since been repaired and play continues at the layout, but that doesn’t mean the perpetrator should skate. “There’s no place anywhere for something like that,” Sylvester said. Agreed. There’s no place for golf course vandalism and certainly no place for this type of hate.",1,0,2

(Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO/MONTEREY COUNTY SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT) An Isla Vista man has been arrested in the alleged hate crime beating of a Santa Paula man the suspect believed was gay, the Santa Barbara County Sheriffs Office said Friday. Deputies said Daniel Joseph Garcia, 19, allegedly battered the 63-year-old victim about 1 p.m. on April 15 near Highway 101 in the Arroyo Quemada area west of Refugio State Beach. Deputies said the victim told them that the suspect shouted a homophobic slur at him and attacked him with a guitar. The victim suffered a traumatic injury requiring medical treatment, deputies said. A few weeks later, investigators identified the suspect as Garcia and executed a search warrant at his Isla Vista residence, but were unable to locate him. An arrest warrant was also obtained and Garcia was found to be in custody in Monterey County on charges unrelated to the attack on the Santa Paula man. Several hours after committing the alleged hate crime in Santa Barbara County, Garcia was arrested by the California Highway Patrol in Monterey County for an unrelated assault with a deadly weapon and for driving under the influence, deputies said. Garcia will be transported to Santa Barbara County to face the hate crime charges after the disposition of his Monterey County case, deputies said.

239,239,"- Joseph Messina woke up Wednesday morning, February 21, and came outside his South Philly home to find graffiti spray painted across the whole front wall. “I feel really shocked and scared,” 12-year-old Joseph told FOX 29, “I’m just shocked that they know our address and that they did that.” “I heard him scream. I didn’t know what happened,” said Margaux Messina, Joseph’s mother. Margaux Messina quickly came outside. When she stepped out the front door, she saw the words “Snitchin and Die,” then a racial slur. “To write the word die, that’s really, like, taking it far. It wasn’t just a racial comment. It was die,” Messina said. Joe Messina believes the graffiti is tied to bullying incidents directed at his son. Joseph is a 7th grader at the Mastery Charter School, Thomas Campus in South Philly, which has a strict police against bullying. “We’re trying to get him into another school and he was an honor roll student and his grades are starting to drop cause it’s consistent bullying,” Joe Messina said. South Detectives and Homeland Security are now investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. Police are also stationed at the school to prevent further incidents. City cleanup crews removed the graffiti on the Messina’s home. “God forbid if they retaliate and start shooting at our house. We’re really concerned about that,” Messina said. “I really hope that they lock them up.

The three were involved in a verbal confrontation in a Walmart parking lot in Fargo, N.D. The dispute was quickly diffused just a few days later, with the women meeting in the police chiefs office for hugs and a posed, smiling photo. It was one of the uglier incidents in Fargo race relations. Human rights groups in North Dakota are pushing for a comprehensive hate crimes law following the incident. (Photo: AP photo) FARGO, N.D. - It was one of the uglier incidents in recent memory in North Dakota’s largest city, Fargo: A white woman was captured on cellphone video shouting “We’re going to kill all of you” at three Somali women in a Walmart parking lot. After the video was posted online and was widely viewed, the dispute was papered over just a few days later, with the women meeting in the police chief’s office for hugs and a posed, smiling photo. Yet that incident and others have some people pushing for a comprehensive hate crimes law in North Dakota. Hukun Abdullahi, a leader of Fargo’s Somalia community, said the Walmart incident was only the latest and most visible one. He said many others go unreported or are not charged appropriately by prosecutors. He favors a state law with enhanced sentences for hate crimes. “This is something that can make a difference,” Abdullahi said. It’s not a popular idea with lawmakers or prosecutors, who say judges already have discretion to take the nature of an offense into account during sentencing. They also note that North Dakota’s every-other-year Legislature wouldn’t even take it up until 2019. Lawmakers haven’t been interested in the past, rejecting two hate crimes proposals that came out of committee and turning down at least three bills meant to ban bias based on sexual orientation in housing, government, public services and the workplace. Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem declined to comment on hate crime proposals. Aaron Birst, a former prosecutor now with the North Dakota Association of Counties, which lobbies the Legislature, said he hasn’t surveyed his group about a comprehensive hate law. But he doesn’t believe there is much interest in one. He said convictions are more likely under a more wide-ranging charge. “If I charge someone with a specific hate crime, I have to prove all of those elements beyond a reasonable doubt as opposed to proving a general assault charge, or disorderly conduct,” he said. Cass County State’s Attorney Birch Burdick, lead prosecutor in North Dakota’s most populous county, said he thinks judges take circumstances of bias-motivated crimes into account at sentencing. “I don’t feel that prosecutors are handicapped by the absence of it,” Burdick said. The push by human rights groups and others for hate-crimes legislation comes as North Dakota is becoming more diverse. Lutheran Social Services, which manages resettlement in the state, has relocated an average of 450 refugees a year in the past decade, most in the Fargo area. The Walmart parking lot incident happened less than a month after a Somali man was assailed by men shouting racial epithets as he moved into a Fargo apartment. And many refugees were made nervous by a Fargo man’s stated plans — following the violence in Charlottesville — to hold a pro-white rally in the city this fall. Two years ago, a Somali-owned cafe in Grand Forks was firebombed. In that case, a Minnesota man was prosecuted under a hate crime law in the federal system, and is serving 15 years in prison. Some lawmakers say the federal law eliminates the need for state action, but the Anti-Defamation League says the feds pursue only a limited range of bias-motivated crimes and a state law would promote joint investigations. The ADL defines hate crimes as those where a person or institution is targeted because of race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. The ADL says they make it possible to bring stiffer penalties. North Dakota has no such law except for one meant to stop intimidation or interference during campaigning or voting, based on a person’s sex, race, color, religion, or national origin, according to the ADL. “There are clear gaps in both the actions and the groups covered,” says Steve Freeman, ADL’s National Director for Legal Affairs. Barry Nelson, a member of the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition and the Fargo Human Relations Commission, is leading an effort to research hate crimes legislation elsewhere to see what works and what doesn’t. “There is some merit to the argument that laws alone don’t solve the problem,” Nelson said. “But I disagree with those who say we shouldn’t try to address it through legal means.” In the meantime, Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said the city is ready and willing to beef up its ordinances to include hate crimes. He’s working with the city attorney and police chief on a proposal. “We have to decide what we want in it and what it would accomplish,” Mahoney said.

242,242,"Offensive graffiti that covered the exterior walls of an Indiana church days after the November 2016 presidential election was the work of the church’s organist, authorities concluded after a six-month investigation into the potential hate crime. The graffiti included the words “Heil Trump,” a gay slur, and a Nazi swastika, the Washington Post reported at the time of an incident that made national headlines. The church reverend theorized at the time that the congregation was targeted because of its inclusiveness, the Post added. Brown County prosecutors have now charged church organist George Nathaniel Stang, 26, with the misdemeanor of institutional criminal mischief. Stang apparently claimed originally that he was first on the scene on the Sunday morning in question to discover the graffiti. Detectives suspected that the perpetrator had familiarity with the small church rather than being an outsider who was connected to a hate group, and they pulled cell phone records which apparently placed the organist in the church area on the night before. If convicted, the suspect faces up to one year behind bars and a maximum fine of $5,000. Stang, who apparently is no fan of President Trump, confessed in a three-page handwritten statement that he sought to “mobilize a movement” given his disappointment with or fear about the national election results, NBC Indianapolis affiliate WTHR reported. “‘I suppose I wanted to give local people a reason to fight for good, even if it was a false flag,’ he wrote. ‘To be clear my actions were not motivated by hate for the church or its congregation. I of course realize now, this was NOT the way to go about inspiring activism.” In a lengthy statement about the vandalism, Bishop Jennifer Baskerville-Burrows of the Indianapolis Episcopal Diocese offered these thoughts. “I was saddened to learn this morning that the vandalism of St. David’s Church in Bean Blossom was committed by the church’s organist, Nathan Stang, who has admitted to police that he spray painted hateful graffiti on the church last November in the wake of the presidential election. This was a hurtful, dishonest, and profoundly misguided action that stands against the values of the people of this diocese and the Episcopal Church, and we will continue to cooperate with the authorities who are pursuing this case…” https://t.co/hMqJCMYHjh@washingtonpost Did you update your article & let viewers know it was a Hate Crime Hoax??? #FakeNews — ????Bink❤ (@markle_darla) May 6, 2017 Hate crime hoaxes, when they allegedly occur, prevent law enforcement authorities from deploying resources to investigate real hate crimes. Although various media organizations claim a surge in hate crimes since the 2016 presidential election in which Donald Trump emerged the victor, apparently, some of them appear to be hoaxes, as the Inquisitr has chronicled. Last month, for example, cops arrested an Indiana State University professor in connection with an alleged hate crime hoax. Authorities charged him with obstruction of justice (a felony) and harassment (a misdemeanor). Authorities indicated that the man made up anti-Muslim threats. A Beloit College student was arrested in February on various charges for what police say amounts to an apparent or potential hate crime hoax involving anti-Muslim threats and symbols in his dorm that he had reported as a threat to his religion and ethnicity. Police say the student spray-painted the offensive imagery himself. An anti-Muslim, headline-making hate crime in December of 2016 against a University of Michigan student in which a suspect threatened to set her hijab on fire was apparently made up, Ann Arbor police detectives concluded, after interviewing witnesses and poring over surveillance footage. Also in December, authorities arrested a suspect in connection with an arson incident in which a black church in Mississippi was burned and the words “Vote Trump” were spray-painted on its walls. The suspect is an African-American man. Following an initial complaint that generated national coverage, the NYPD charged a Muslim student, who claimed she was harassed by Trump supporters on a subway, with filing a false police report. Elsewhere, a Florida man involved in a dispute over child custody was accused of setting his ex-girlfriend’s car on fire, as well a leaving a note with the words “KKK” and “Trump” in the woman’s mailbox. He also allegedly faked his own kidnapping. Philadelphia police arrested a South Jersey man for allegedly spray-painting racist, pro-Trump messages on several cars on the morning after the November 8 presidential election. The suspect, who was arrested two weeks later, allegedly is the ex-boyfriend of one of the property-damage victims, the Philadelphia Inquirer/Daily News reported, and the victim and her daughter, who are black, identified the suspect when detectives showed them some surveillance footage. The suspect is also African-American, Breitbart News added. A Chicago college student allegedly faked an incident in which she claimed to have received anti-gay, pro-Trump notes and emails, according to the educational institution’s president, who also indicated that the student is no longer enrolled there. Separately, a Boston-area man reportedly admitted to lodging a fake hate crime complaint about being accosted by two alleged Trump supporters.”The men used a racial slur, made a reference to lynching and warned him ‘this is Donald ‘Trump country now,’ according to the report he gave police,” the Boston Herald detailed. Malden, Massachusetts, police subsequently determined that the story was a complete fabrication. As the Inquisitr also previously outlined, a University of Louisiana-Lafayette student acknowledged that she made up a story about being assaulted, robbed, and having her hijab torn off by two men, one of whom was wearing a Trump hat. The Lafayette Police Department later announced that it was no longer investigating after the alleged victim admitted to the fabrication. According to CBS New Orleans affiliate WWL-TV, authorities plan to charge the woman, 18, with filing a false report. [Featured Image by sashafolly/Shutterstock]",1,0,2
243,243,"OLATHE, Kan. — The man accused in a possible hate crime shooting at an Olathe bar has notified U.S. District Court, District of Kansas, that he intends to change his plea, online court records say. Adam Purinton’s change of plea hearing is scheduled for May 21, 2018 at 10:30 a.m. Purinton previously pleaded guilty in federal court to hate crime and firearm charges. The indictment for the hate crime accuses Purinton of shooting and killing Srinivas Kuchibhotla because of his race, color, religion or national origin. Likewise, the indictment accused Purinton of attempting to kill Alok Madasani because of his race, color, religion or national origin. Ian Grillot was also a victim in the shooting. He said he saw two men he knew as regulars of the bar being harassed by Adam Purinton and escorted Purinton out. “’You’re gonna stick up for them, and not me?’” Grillot recalled Purinton saying. “And that’s when I kind of knew what he was insinuating.” That insinuation Grillot understood to be about the color of Srinivas and Alok’s skin. Grillot said when Purinton came back to the bar about 30 minutes after he was kicked out, he was wearing “a scarf or something over his head trying to conceal his identity.” The two Indian men were clearly Purinton’s targets as he opened fire. Grillot said. A third indictment accuses Purinton of violating a federal firearms statute. The FBI defines a hate crime as “a criminal offense against a person or property … motivated by an offenders bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender or gender identity.” Hate itself is not a crime and the FBI is mindful in protecting people’s freedom of speech and other civil liberties, but if investigators find a murder or violence occurred because of the above mentioned qualifiers, they often ask for federal hate crime charges. On March 6, 2018 Purinton pleaded guilty in Johnson County to three counts of premeditated first-degree murder. During the guilty plea hearing in Johnson County admitted to killing Kuchibhotla and wounding Madasani and Grillot two other men in a February 2017 shooting at Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe. After the shooting, Purinton drove to a restaurant in Clinton, Missouri, where a bartender called police after Purinton allegedly told him about the shooting. Listen to the bartender’s 911 call here. Purtinton will be sentenced May 4, 2018 at 3 p.m. for the three premeditated first-degree murder charges he pleaded guilty to. The state of Kansas does not differentiate for attempted murder in official charges, which is why Purinton faces three counts of premeditated first-degree murder, even though only one victim died.

245,245,"“To those white people that are seeing this, use this as an opportunity and wake up call to confront the privilege in your own life, wrote Jenny Lundt. Sadly, we live in times where police officers can routinely discriminate against people of color and use excessive, sometimes even lethal, force yet manage to get away scot free, whereas an African American student who someone assumed was holding a weapon could shut down an entire university, leaving thousands scared for their lives. In yet another display of systemic racism, a black student at Colgate University, a private liberal arts college in Hamilton, New York, induced panic among his peers and faculty by carrying a hot glue gun on campus. The administration immediately asked its students to take shelter and word spread there were two gunmen on campus, and one had committed suicide. None of it turned out to be true. The entire ordeal must have been traumatic for many, particularly the minority students, which is why the incident prompted a sophomore to share a social media post demonstrating her white privilege and how institutionalized racism continues to be a major problem. In her now-viral Facebook post, Jenny Lundt not just talked about the phenomenon but actually went a step ahead and shared her own picture, which showed her carrying a sharp metal sword, to explain how racial profiling works. This is me, only one year ago on this very campus, running around the academic quad with a f****** sharp metal sword,” she began. “People thought it was funny. People laughed — oh look at that harmless, silly white girl with a giant sword!” Lundt then talked about how “limited information” didnt just shut down her college for over four hours, it also put “all black men on this campus in danger and at risk of being killed.” “That is the reality of the institutionalized racism in the United States. If you think for even a second this wasnt profiling, ask yourself why this sword is still in my room and has not ONCE made anyone uncomfortable,” she continued. “No one has EVER called the police on me. Understand that there are larger forces at play than this one night, and this one instance of racism. This is engrained in our university and our larger society.” Once her post started drawing attention, the student decided to use her internet fame to educate white people how they can take a stand against the plague of racial discrimination. “To those white people that are seeing this, use this as an opportunity and wake up call to confront the privilege in your own life, she wrote. Have these conversations and find the own swords in your life... things you could get away with that your friends of color could not. There are many white people on this post trying to suppress the voices of others with comments such as all lives matter or white privilege doesnt exist. CHALLENGE THAT. fight back. And not just on this post, but in real life. Challenge racist jokes. Challenge stereotypes and hold your white friends accountable.” It was a great effort on Lundt’s part and drew many positive reactions. white people using their privilege to educate, a concept! pic.twitter.com/6ugbTtxSOH — con(no)r (@ctfuconnor) May 12, 2017 However, some not only disagreed with her statement but also challenged the existence of white privilege. Some people of color were also — and rightfully so — upset that others only started responding to the issue of white privilege after a white person wrote about it. Lundt later updated her post to share the words of a Sahil Gadhavi, who published an open letter addressed to her. Where is this over-pouring of attention when black children are being shot by the police everyday, while your own white children are being raised in the ignorance afforded by their skin? he asked. Where is this praise when black activists march up and down the city squares all over the country screaming black lives matter and all they hear back is all lives matter? According to a report published in American Journal of Public Health, police are nearly three times more likely to kill black men than their white counterparts.

News4s Tracee Wilkins reports on the indictment of the suspect on Thursday, and what University of Maryland students say about the crime still affecting their campus. (Published Thursday, July 13, 2017) The white University of Maryland student accused of stabbing a black Bowie State University student to death this spring has been indicted, and video of the entire encounter has been instrumental in the case, officials say. Sean Christopher Urbanski, 22, is headed to trial for allegedly killing Richard Collins III, 23, on May 20, just three days before Collins was set to graduate from the historically black college. The killing that police say was unprovoked sparked discussions across the country about hate on college campuses. The killing was investigated by local police and the FBI as a possible hate crime, but prosecutors were not able to bring hate crime charges against Urbanski, Prince Georges County States Attorney Angela Alsobrooks said. We didnt have enough today, she said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. Student Killed at UMd. Honored at Bowie Graduation Bowie State University held a moment of silence at Tuesdays commencement to honor a student whose life was tragically cut short, just days before he was set to graduate. (Published Tuesday, May 23, 2017) Urbanski previously was found to have been a part of a Facebook group called Alt-Reich Nation, where members post disparaging material about African Americans and others. Its often difficult to build a hate crime case, Alsobrooks said. Developing a motive is always a challenging aspect of a case. In this case, and in any other case, you cant get it wrong, she said. Why is something that we all want to know, Alsobrooks continued. The investigation is ongoing. Should the evidence warrant it, its still possible that Urbanski could be charged with a hate crime in the future. Video of the fatal attack has been crucial to the case, said Chief Joseph Ruddy, who leads the Prince Georges County homicide unit. Killing at University of Maryland Rocks Campus University of Maryland students are stunned that a 23-year-old Bowie State University student was killed Saturday on the UMd. campus.

The Brooklyn crook found his first victim at the corner of Carroll Street and Albany Avenue around 10:30 a.m. on Jan. 18, cops said. “Give me your money!” the knife-wielding goon demanded.

249,249,"The hateful letter threatened to exterminate Muslims, torture children, rape women and burn places of worship. Just hours before the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY) received an award from the New York City Council for helping out hate crime victims, mobilizing against President Donald Trumps Muslim ban and fighting for social justice, the civil rights organization received an extremely disturbing threat. According to CAIR’s New York chapter, the letter threatened extermination, torture and rape against Muslims. The hateful letter called for the torture of Muslim children and rape of Muslim women, and burning down mosques along with other graphic threats. The group received this disturbing threat few hours after the Islamic Eid al-Fitr holiday. CAIR-NY also mentioned the NYPD was investigating the letter as a potential hate crime. We are humbled by the recognition of the New York City Council for our civil rights work, and simultaneously determined to forge ahead despite the deplorable threat we received, said CAIR-NY Executive Director Afaf Nasher. This threat will not intimidate us or detract from our unshakeable resolve to ensure American Muslims and all targeted communities can practice their faith freely as ensured by our laws. CAIR-NY Legal Director Albert Fox Cahn also expressed disappointment with the Islamophobic letter. Were outraged to see our staff targeted, but we know were just one of many other Muslim institutions that have been threatened or attacked in recent months, he said. This threat and the threats against other Muslim New Yorkers, show why recognition from the City Council is so vital to our mission. As long as our Muslim brothers and sisters are being attack, all New Yorkers must come together to vocally support their right to practice their faith. Despite this threat, we remain committed to the proposition that no New Yorker should have to choose between their religion and their safety, and were honored to have the City Council recognize the importance of our work to make that a reality. CAIR has been targeted before with such hate messages. An Islamophobe from Oak Forest, Illinois was charged after leaving threatening messages for an official at the Chicago chapter of the organization on his personal phone line. “Hey, this is America calling. You are not welcome here. Take your f***ing s*** back to Syria. We will kill you. F*** Democrats. We will kill you. You are not welcome here. Get out. Take your f***ing Muslim law... Jesus Christ is the only God there is,” was the message in the voicemail. The civil rights organization’s NY chapter said there was a 560 percent increase in anti-Muslim incidents in New York in 2016 compared to 2015. And the latest threat against CAIR’s NY chapter comes days after the Supreme Court partially unblocked Trumps travel ban on visitors from six Muslim countries. The countrys largest Muslim advocacy group also mentioned the hateful note appears to have been sent from the United Kingdom. It had similarities to recent threats against a mosque in Manhattan. According to police, the letter received last week by Masjid Manhattan threatened a massacre on a scale never seen before. Banner/thumbnail credit: Reuters",1,3,3
250,250,"fullscreen continue view fullscreen close Update: Metropolitan Police Department officers arrested a suspect who allegedly vandalized Casa Ruby, assaulted an employee, and made threats at the LGBT community center in an incident on Sunday afternoon. Andrew Cook of Southeast D.C. was arrested on Monday night and charged with felony destruction of property, simple assault, and threatening to kidnap or injure a person. Original: A visitor vandalized a prominent LGBT community center on Georgia Avenue NW and assaulted an employee on Sunday. The suspect walked into Casa Ruby on Sunday afternoon and a verbal altercation ensued with an employee of the non profit, according to the Metropolitan Police Department report. The altercation turned violent when the suspect approached the employee and hit her in the forehead with his pointer finger. Then, the suspect picked up a bar of soap and threw it at her. He left, but not before throwing a brick through the front door and kicking it. On his way out, he said, Ill kill your motherf*cking *ss. Yall tranny motherf*ckers think somebody wont f*ck yall up, according to the police report. This is the third incident Casa Ruby has faced in the past two weeks, says Ruby Corado, the non profits executive director and founder. Unfortunately weve seen a pattern that people begin with threats and then deliver on their promises, she says. I used to get a lot of threats. Now theyre showing up here. Corado says that two weeks ago, a man came to the center who appeared friendly and then started making sexual advances to some of the youth there. When they did not respond, he went crazy and he punched a hole in the wall, she says. He was arrested, but last week he came back and punched another hole in the wall. The suspect on Sunday is a different man. This one was more of a bully, says Corado. Interim Police Chief Peter Newsham came to Casa Ruby later on Sunday following a text from Corado, after responding officers told her theyd follow up in a few days to a weeks time. This man is running out here in the community. What do you mean youre going to be here next week? she says. I texted [Newsham] and an hour later he walked through the door. Were a target so it does mean a lot that he came in to make a stand. That sends a message to our community. Mayor Muriel Bowser has nominated Newsham to be the permanent chief, pending council approval. Corado says Newsham assured her that D.C. Police are working to arrest the suspect. MPD has not yet released information about the suspect. The police report indicates the incident is being investigated as a hate crime. Corado stood in between Newsham and Bowser on Friday as they announced that hate crimes in D.C. increased 62 percent from 2015 to 2016. In total, hate crimes increased from 66 incidents in 2015 to 107 incidents in 2016—those related to gender identity or expression nearly doubled, and those related to sexual orientation increased by about 50 percent. It is an increase—I live it. I get bullied. I get name-called. Its real, says Corado. I never had to call the police like weve had to call the police in the last six months. Its not just Casa Ruby, either. Shortly after the inauguration, someone threw a brick through the window of HIPS, a non profit that supports sex workers and drug users. The damage to the door alone at Casa Ruby will cost around $2,000 to fix, Corado says. She also plans to talk with the non profits major funders about getting a security guard for the Georgia Avenue NW storefront, which also serves as a hypothermia shelter and provides hot meals and assistance to some of the Districts most vulnerable residents. Casa Ruby also accepts donations on its website. While talking to DCist over the phone, Corado was also speaking to a person who came to fix the door. Do you have glass that is shatterproof? Corado asked him. I need something that if somebody throws a brick again, that it will stand because Im going to be getting more of this. Im not going to be paying for another door every week.",1,2,0
252,252,"Back in 2014, Justin Bieber faced his fair share of legal trouble . He was arrested in Miami for DUI and charged with careless driving and resisting arrest (and pleaded guilty in court), and, later that year, and he was also arrested following an ATV accident , later pleading guilty to assault and careless driving for that incident in 2015. On top of all that, Justin was accused of throwing eggs at a neighbors house , resulting in tens of thousands of dollars in damages. Justin pleaded no contest to one count of misdemeanor vandalism following the incident. Since the infamous egging, Justins neighbors (Jeffrey and Suzanne Schwartz) have come forward with further accusations against the singer-songwriter. According to TMZ, the following year, Jeffrey reportedly claimed that Justin was responsible for damaging his reputation as on online auto industry leader from all the publicity surrounding the egg incident. In turn, TMZ reported that sources told them the neighbor asked for $1 million from the Biebs. And in 2016, the Schwartzes filed claims of ongoing emotional distress, accusing Justin of causing them two years worth of physical ailments. In response, TMZ reported that Justin issued court documents requesting the neighbors undergo mental evaluations to evaluate their claims. Now, according to TMZ , Jeffrey and Suzanne are back with yet another claim: a hate crime. They allege that Justin used anti-Semitic comments against them, referring to Jeffrey as a little Jew boy. However, according to Justins lawyers, the Schwartzes previously had claimed that these words came from Justins bodyguard . In response to this new claim against Justin, TMZ reported that the attorneys for the singer have responded , calling this claim preposterous. TMZ also noted that the charge of a hate crime is significant, as it can increase the amount of money they could collect if they win their lawsuit.

254,254,"Within the last two weeks, much of the African American community has been thrown into abject pain yet again. The police officer who was seen shooting Philando Castile, killing him in front of his girlfriend and four-year-old daughter, was acquitted. Four African American members of the LGBTQ community, who marched in the PRIDE parade in Columbus, Ohio and who felt the burden of their race as well as their sexuality, decided to protest the Castile ruling by calling for seven minutes of silence – and the result is that they were arrested as whites looked on, appearing to be cheering their fate. And then the jury in the trial of the former University of Cincinnati police officer who shot and killed Sam Dubose decided it could not decide if that officer was guilty of any crime, and a second mistrial was declared. The pain of always being denied justice is almost too much to bear. While there will be and have been protests against the injustice meted out in cases involving police officers killing black and brown people, protesting is not enough. The powers that be of and in this country have learned to shut out the chants and have stopped listening to the demands. They know they are in control, and they are fairly confident that no amount of direct actions carried out will change the script. If we understand the “justice” system, we can see that perhaps they have a point. Though the Seventh Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that American citizens have a right to a “speedy and public trial by an impartial jury,” that right has been denied to African Americans since this country’s inception. And though the Eighth Amendment guaranteed the right to be protected from excessive bail and fines being imposed upon American citizens, as well as guaranteeing that we should be protected from cruel and unusual punishment, that right, too, has often eluded African Americans and Hispanics, and poor people in general, regardless of their race. The truth is, we have a problem in these United States. The justice system is rigged, to use one of this administration’s words heard throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. It is rigged to protect police officers and to insure that black and brown people lose in cases involving them and police officers. The injustice begins with the grand jury. Those two words are powerful; they suggest that there is a mechanism in place that insures justice. Yet, according to MSNBC anchor Joy Ann Reid, that is not the case. Reid served two weeks on a grand jury this past spring and in the aftermath of the Castile case, wrote about it in an article entitled “Philando Castile and this Savage System.” According to Reid, accusations brought by black and brown people against police officers are almost sure to be knocked down by grand juries, which, she writes, have been constructed to protect police officers at all cost. Those who challenge the rightness of that unspoken understanding are many times just booted off the grand jury, she writes. Many times, those being charged by police after an altercation do not testify (a fact with which Reid strongly takes issue) but police officers are invited to give their side of the story, and too often, all the grand jury hears are the voices of the police officers who have committed an offense and the prosecutors who appear, to be in place primarily to protect what the officers do, regardless of how obvious it might appear that they have seriously abrogated the rule of law. Black and brown people expect justice, because all humans believe that justice is a right. More than that, it is a need. At the heart of the problem, however, is a belief, based on white supremacy, that black and brown people are not, in fact, entitled to justice because they are less than human. That belief is a mainstay of white supremacist ideology and has been passed down for literally hundreds of years. We may live in the 21st century, but we walk with views on race which began in this country in the 17th century with the Puritans. Those views have been nurtured and advanced, and have only gotten more virulent over the years. The system is rigged against people of color (against women, people of different religions and poor people as well) The founders of this great nation were clear in their belief that black and brown people did not deserve justice and believed that to give them justice would go against the will of God. White supremacy was preached and taught in the North before it ever hit the South. The objectification, dehumanization and criminalization of black people is as much a part of the American ethos as is the Constitution itself. Unless and until something is done to change the criminal justice system, with grand juries in place to protect police officers, nothing is going to change. More African Americans will be shot and killed by police officers who know the justice system will protect them. And unless and until trials of black and brown people are really outfitted with juries “of their peers,” and not with white people who carry such deep implicit bias that it is impossible to see or hear black people as, in fact, people, who deserve justice, nothing will change.",1,0,0
255,255,"Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr. today announced the indictment of WILLIE AMES, 47, for attacking two men on the platform of the 14th Street – Union Square subway station after making derogatory statements about Mexican-Americans. The defendant is charged in a New York State Supreme Court indictment with Attempted Assault in the First and Third Degrees as Hate Crimes, Assault in the Second and Third Degrees as Hate Crimes, and Aggravated Harassment in the Second Degree. [1] “This defendant’s attacks on two New Yorkers were attacks on all New Yorkers, as alleged in the indictment,” said District Attorney Vance “Willie Ames is charged with selectively ambushing two young men on their way home from work for no other reason than their perceived nationality. He pummeled his victims without provocation and with so much force that one was knocked onto the live subway track of one of the busiest stations in the City.

256,256,"(NBC News) The Chicago man seen in a viral video berating a woman for wearing a shirt bearing the Puerto Rican flag has been charged with felony hate crimes. Cook County States Attorney spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said Friday Timothy Trybus, 62, is charged with two counts of felony hate crime. Video shot on June 24 shows Trybus repeatedly yelling at 24-year-old Mia Irizarry for wearing a Puerto Rican flag shirt, asking if shes a U.S. citizen and saying youre not going to change us, you know that? and the world is not going to change the United States of America. Puerto Rico is, in fact, part of the United States and Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. The video showed a responding police officer doing little to stop Trybus or remove him from the picnic shelter, reserved by Irizarry, where the confrontation occurred.

Fox5DC reports 52-year-old Ronald Alford Sr., a black man, is currently facing charges related to the destruction of property after a painting of a swastika was found on a trash cart in a residence hall on the UMD campus on Sept. 27. Asked how students feel that the man accused of drawing the swastika is part of a “historically oppressed minority group,” one student said, “When it happened, we all thought it was a student who went here and lived in the building, so I was kind of like, ‘I have to live here. What if he still goes here?’” “I guess it proves that you dont have to be a certain race to hate people, but I mean, its just you would think that someone, like, especially from a race that has been subjected to hate before, you would think, why would you want to reciprocate that to somebody else? I guess that’s the world we live in today,” she continued. According to the Diamondback, the UMD campus newspaper, Alford is a former UMD employee. Alford will not be allowed back on campus.

264,264,"GENEVA (Reuters) - United Nations human rights experts called on U.S. political leaders “at all levels” on Wednesday to combat rising racist violence and xenophobia and urged prosecution of perpetrators of hate crimes. Women sit by an impromptu memorial of flowers commemorating the victims at the scene of the car attack on a group of counter-protesters during the Unite the Right rally as people continue to react to the weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. REUTERS/Justin Ide U.S. President Donald Trump insisted on Tuesday that both left- and right-wing extremists had become violent during a weekend rally by white nationalists in Virginia, reigniting a political firestorm over race relations in the United States and his own leadership of a national crisis. After clashes between the two sides at Saturday’s rally, a car ploughed into opponents of the gathering, killing one woman and injuring 19 others. A 20-year-old Ohio man, James Fields, said to have harbored Nazi sympathies, was charged with murder. “We are outraged by the violence in Charlottesville and the racial hatred displayed by right-wing extremists, white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups,” the independent U.N. experts said in a joint statement issued in Geneva. “We call for the prosecution and adequate punishment of all perpetrators and the prompt establishment of an independent investigation into the events,” they said. The legacy of slavery in America has left two “invidious” aspects, the “ongoing racial discrimination” and the notion of white supremacy, said Anastasia Crickley, chair of the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, who is one of the three experts who issued the statement. “This notion of white supremacy as far as many of us can see is being re-articulated from top to bottom in the USA at the moment,” she told Reuters. “In looking to addressing racial discrimination, we have got to look to very clear, unequivocal statements from political leaders at all levels,” she added. Crickley, asked whether Trump was providing leadership on the issue and whether she had concerns on his public statements, replied: “Already leaders across the political spectrum are calling for more political leadership from the White House and from the leadership spectrum. I think yes we do need that.” The events in Virginia were the “latest examples” of increasing racism, racial discrimination, Afrophobia, racist violence and xenophobia “observed in demonstrations across the USA”, the U.N. experts said. Recent incidents in California, Oregon, New Orleans and Kentucky had demonstrated “the geographical spread of the problem”, they added.

268,268,"Hate crimes bring anxiety, action for South Asians Kamna Shastri “Go back to where you came from,” “Go home”—these were the words uttered by perpetrators just before they pulled their triggers in hate crimes targeting South Asians over the past two months. In February, Srinivas Kuchibhotla of Kansas was shot and killed while his friend Alok Madasani was wounded in a hate crime. Locally, the shooting of Deep Rai, a practitioner of the Sikh faith, in his own driveway in Kent caught the attention of local and national news. The man was approached by his assailant who had covered his face on an early March evening. An argument ensued. Then the gunman shot Rai in his arm. For the South Asian community in the Pacific Northwest, these incidents have sparked new concerns as well as activism. Neeti Mittal, president of The India Association of Western Washington, is seeing the emotional consequences take shape around her. Families that once spoke in their regional languages in public, and people who wore traditional salwaar kameez to run errands, are changing their habits to keep a low profile. Mittal says that this environment of hostility has created tension for the community’s American-born children: “I just feel bad that the kids who were born here, they are starting to feel confused and that is not good for the fabric of our nation,” she said. Crimes targeting South Asians are happening at rates comparable to post-9/11 panic after dipping over the past decade, according to a report published last month by the organization South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT). In a report published earlier this year, SAALT found that 94% of the crimes collected in their database between January and November 2016 were motivated by anti-Muslim sentiment. The victims of these crimes however held varying identities and spanned countries of origin from Ethiopia to Bangladesh. What the data says The Seattle Police Department’s (SPD) Bias Crime Unit reports its citywide bias crime data, collecting and categorizing incidents by motivation. Since the beginning of 2017, the SPD has collected 50 incidents of bias-motivated crime in total. Twenty-one cases of malicious harassment have been reported, compared to 16 cases of non-criminal bias incidents, where derogatory comments—though protected under free speech—might incite fear in a person or group. Under racially motivated crimes, eight targeted Blacks, one targeted a Latino, one a multi-racial person, and three targeted whites. Religiously-motivated incidents targeted Muslims and Jews. Ethnically motivated incidents targeted Arabs and “unspecified” groups. A large South Asian population clusters to the east of Seattle, namely in Bellevue, Redmond, Sammamish, and Kirkland. The Bellevue Police Department’s 2016 data reports 16 hate crimes overall for that year. Seven explicitly note anti-Muslim motivation and one crime details a Sikh Uber driver who was threatened and beaten by his passenger. 2017 hate crime data is not yet available. The BPD has stood in solidarity with the South Asian community and other immigrant communities. On Sunday March 5, shortly after the shooting in Kent and two weeks after Kuchibhotla was fatally shot dead, Tasveer took the lead in organizing a vigil for the shooting victims in Kansas. Over 43 other local organizations—many based in the South Asian community, but many others as well—joined a diverse group of community members at Crossroads Park in Bellevue. Along with speakers like Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and Kshama Sawant, a Bellevue Police representative took to the stage to assure community members that the BPD stands with them and that they should turn to the police department at any time. The mood was somber at the #WeBelong vigil. Homemade signs were hoisted in the air. A gray sky and the bone-biting cold mimicked the tragedy behind the vigil’s premise. Even in extreme weather, more than a hundred-people huddled together listening to speakers who unanimously called for the South Asian community to organize and get involved rather than to stay at home, worried and fearful. IAWW has been organizing hate crime workshops in Bellevue, with help and support from Bellevue Police Department. So far, two workshops have taken place, with March’s workshop bringing 200 attendees. The workshops provide attendees with a combination of best practices for self-protection, emergency response, and awareness. Upcoming workshops plan to expand to other places and focus on appropriate physical and mental steps to take in the face of a hate crime. Lalita Uppala is the community program director for IAWW’s programs. “There is … the realization that we are not necessarily emerging unscathed from the irrational anger and racism towards immigrant communities hence the need to act has intensified and the understanding of what other immigrant communities experience dawned clear,” she said. South Asians are already immensely diverse, with intertwining and diverging histories, religions, and cultures that brush up against one another under the same label making collaboration across and beyond South Asian communities necessary. So, what should we do? During IAWW’s workshop in March, Mittal brought up a question: What do we do when verbal harassment is protected under the freedom of speech clause, but has the consequence instigating fear in an individual or community? The Bellevue Police Department’s response was to report any instances of verbal harassment and derogatory speech just as one would report a violent hate crime; reporting will help law enforcement track these instances and create a record. SAALT lists recommendations to combat hate crimes on the governmental, legislative and community levels. The recommendations call for more action and less lip-service from government agencies, and for a state, federal, and community-based cooperatives to improve crime reporting. They also stress the importance of political and civic engagement education for South Asian, Muslim and Arab communities, something that is already happening. Tahmina Watson, a lawyer and community advocate at Watson Immigration Services who also spoke at the #WeBelong vigil, said the South Asian community is already taking the first, crucial step: civic engagement. “Being part of the dialogue and decision making is absolutely crucial at this point,” she said, listing local and national political leaders like Pramila Jayapal, Kshama Sawant, and Vandana Slatter. Watson also brought to light an interesting and contested situation in the South Asian community. While there is a range of incomes and issues faced by the many groups that make up a larger South Asian regional diaspora, South Asians’ image as educated, skilled professionals calls into question how such privilege should be used. “We are a very large part of the King County for sure and just in general … we are one of the most educated, and high skilled … communities in the country,” she said. “Why are we not out there, representing our communities even more?” Watson notes that some people are hesitant to get involved due to a lack of time, or feelings of helplessness. Her suggestion, echoed by others like Mittal, is to tackle challenges head-on by organizing people with varying skill sets who can “come to the table” and work together, much like dividing and conquering. Those people need not only be lawyers and educators, nonprofit organizations, and healthcare advocates. Everyone must bring their talents and interests to the forefront, using unique strengths to create an environment where hate crimes and hostility are not ‘just the dark side’ of society’s status quo. Watson put it this way: “Every drop makes an ocean. Every drop done by somebody will ultimately have a bigger impact, but sitting back and thinking someone else is going to do it? That notion must go away.”",1,0,0

Portland police arrested Jamie Hoffman, 20, in early February and charged him with a civil rights offense, two counts of assault and criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon. On Jan. 27, Hoffman allegedly yelled racial slurs at a group of students waiting at a bus stop, assaulted two students who came to their defense and brandished a screwdriver, according to police. In addition to criminal prosecution brought by the Cumberland County District Attorney’s office, Mills filed a civil complaint Friday against Hoffman, seeking to bar him from going near the students and high school in future. “People who stand up for the rights of immigrants and people of color should not be subject to threats or acts of violence motivated by the perpetrator’s bias,” Mills, a Democrat, said in a statement. Hoffman pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges, according to the Portland Press Herald. His lawyer, Patrick Gordon, could not be immediately reached for comment. Before the incident allegedly became violent, Hoffman told the group of students — including ones originally from Mexico, Sudan and the Republic of Congo — that immigrants should go back to their own countries and die, according to the attorney general. In the criminal matter, Hoffman’s lawyer reportedly argued that the case would involve his client’s right to free speech. The incident, which happened shortly after President Donald Trump issued a since suspended order temporarily barring resident of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, became politicized even before Portland police arrested Hoffman. In an open letter to the public school community, Portland Superintendent Xavier Botana noted the “noxious environment in which this deplorable event took place.” And students throughout the district organized a solidarity rally in support of their classmates at Casco Bay. The Maine Republican Party then accused Botana of using public resources to force his “partisan agenda” on students and teachers. The state GOP filed a public records request for the superintendent’s communications, saying that they will reveal “outside and internal forces” that may be influencing his “political agenda.”",1,0,0

A District of Cook County Forest Preserve Police Officer is seen standing in the background of the video and not intervening. That officer has resigned, officials said. Mia Irizarry posted the 36-minute video to her Facebook page on June 14, and various versions of it began circulating, stirring outrage worldwide and racking up millions of views. Ricardo Rossello, the governor of Puerto Rico, tweeted that he was appalled, shocked & disturbed by the incident. The video shows Trybus trying to intimidate Irizarry, and demanding to know why shes wearing a shirt that features the Puerto Rican flag. You should not be wearing that in the United States of America, Trybus tells her, despite the fact that Puerto Rico is part of the United States — its been a territory of the U.S. since 1898 and a U.S. commonwealth since 1952. Puerto Rican citizens were granted U.S. citizenship in 1917. The officer can be seen standing in the background of the video, watching the confrontation from several yards away, while Irizarry asks him for help. The officer doesnt appear to respond, and Trybus continues to come closer to the woman and harass her, demanding her citizenship status. Youre not going to change us, you know that? Trybus tells Irizarry. The world is not going to change the United States of America. Cook County Commissioner Jesus Chuy Garcia released a statement that said the misdemeanor charges werent enough. A charge for simple assault or disorderly conduct is not sufficient, this incident must be investigated and charged as a hate crime, Garcia said. The Cook County Forest Preserves said that the officer who stood in the background of the video was assigned to desk duty while a probe is underway; however, on Wednesday officials said the officer had resigned. Effective today, Officer Patrick Connor no longer serves in the police department of the Forest Preserves of Cook County, the forest preserve tweeted Wednesday. He resigned late today.

After the crime, which occurred at Shattuck Avenue and Center Street, Jeffrey Frazier Pachingger walked a few blocks to the police department to turn himself in. As the victim bent over to unlock his bike, Pachingger allegedly came up behind him and struck him in the head with a rock, said Officer Byron White, a spokesman for the police department. The victim then fled.

289,289,"Wilton High School student government responds to recent hate crime To Whom It May Concern: The hate crime that took place at Middlebrook last week deeply impacted students and staff throughout Wilton’s school community. Events like these are especially malicious and indefensible in that they both threaten the well-being and effective functioning of our schools and damage our reputation. This crime occurred during the height of Wilton High School’s spirit week, which caused my peers and me to spend time thinking about the deep purpose and value of celebrating our identity as Warriors. It is the expectation of Wilton High School’s Executive Board that writing “Jews will burn” on the locker of an 11-year-old Jewish student will be treated as a crime and handled accordingly. Part of the healing process must include a demonstration by both Middlebrook and district-wide officials that this behavior will be taken extremely seriously. (The administrative response has adopted the necessary tone and has been effective up to this point.) This crime feels eerily familiar to Wilton High School students and staff. Only a few years ago, the high school removed three swastikas from its halls over the course of a month. It must be noted that the troubling pattern of news-making hate crimes in Wilton over the past few years have been predominantly anti-Semitic; for this reason, it is the responsibility of parents and educators to ensure that all students have a thorough understanding of the history of anti-Semitism and of the Holocaust. A more general discussion of hatefulness is essential and productive, but lacks a necessary precision. Adults must expect students to resist and refute hate as passionately as possible, and, in turn, students must expect adults to foster an environment where this is achievable. Parents and teachers must spend meaningful time discussing the implications of this crime with their children and students; through this process, we may be able to ascertain how and why such repulsive behavior can recur in an otherwise unified, intelligent, supportive, and compassionate town. While the well-being of Wilton students always must be our priority, it is crucial to note the incorrigible damage of headlines like “A Middlebrook Student Found A ‘Jews Will Burn’ Note In Her Locker & Its Part Of An Alarming Trend.” Defending and maintaining our reputation is not a superficial or trivial undertaking, and it becomes increasingly difficult to do this when our schools habitually make national news for the same reasons. The way others view our town contributes to each of our identities, for better or worse. Let’s ensure that upon hearing “Wilton,” outsiders will think not of hatred or anti-Semitism, but of compassion, community, and success. Wilton High School’s Executive Board offers its continued assistance in managing, addressing, refuting, and discussing this hate crime in whatever capacity is deemed useful. We stand unapologetically against the dangerous hostility and stupidity that this crime displays and hold firmly that such behavior is antithetical to the values that students cherish deeply. May we channel the anger and pain engendered by this crime into a constructive, collaborative energy that assures such an event will never recur. Respectfully, Cameron Berg — President, on behalf of the Wilton High School Executive Board: Michael Wallace — Co-Vice President Tor Aronson — Co-Vice President Rishabh Raniwala — Treasurer Johnny Maggio — Senior Class President George Murphy — Junior Class President Jake Zeyher — Sophomore Class President Pierce Bazewicz — Freshman Class President Lydia Hoffman — Communications Chair Addie Tanzman — Decorations Chair Eve Ogdon — Social Chair Ava Kaplan — Coordinating Chair Elizabeth Yoon — Website Management Chair Sadie Kinnersley — President’s Assistant",1,0,3
294,294,"Texas witnessed the worst mass shooting in the state’s history on Sunday when a gunman opened fire at a small church in Sutherland Springs, killing 26 people and wounding 20 others. Roughly half of those killed were children, including the pastor’s 14-year-old daughter. The tragedy renewed a bitter 2nd Amendment debate, coming on the heels of the deadliest mass shooting in recent U.S. history that left 58 people dead at a country music festival in Las Vegas in October. In the wake of Sunday’s massacre, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) suggested parishioners arm themselves as a safety precaution. But Paxton may have overlooked what security experts say is the most effective measure for responding to attacks: planning and training for the event of a shooting. Marianne Alvarez is a former law enforcement officer and director of risk management at the ALICE Training Institute, which teaches institutions how to prepare for active shooter events. Alvarez also formerly served as the director of security at a church in San Jose, California, and she offered tips for houses of worship and other institutions on how to prepare for a potential attack. ALICE is an acronym for alert, lockdown, inform, counter and evacuate. These are the basic steps the institute suggests for responding to a shooting. What we found is that law enforcement is not getting there in time. In prior years, Alvarez said, institutions were trained to emphasize the “l” ― lockdown. The main message for targets of a shooting was to close and lock doors and stay put until law enforcement arrived on the scene. But although a lockdown may be effective in some scenarios, people need to be aware of other measures, she said. “What we found is that law enforcement is not getting there in time,” she told HuffPost. “It takes law enforcement typically five to eight minutes” to arrive on the scene of an attack, “and it’s during that time when all the killing typically happens.” Moving through the steps of the acronym, Alvarez said “alert,” is crucial for getting people apprised of a potential threat. “A church could have camera system in place, or a security team, or the alert could be someone screaming, ‘Man with a gun.’ That alert puts people in a different mindset,” Alvarez said. One of the difficulties for churches and other “soft targets” is that people at those places generally aren’t on the lookout for attacks. “People may go to a house of worship and have a mindset that it’s not going to happen here,” she said. “It’s a place where you feel safe. It’s a sanctuary.” When an attack does occur, she continued, “it’s a huge shock and they might freeze.” Training for potential risks like an active shooter can ensure that instead of freezing, those present are better able to “respond under pressure.” Closely related to communicating that initial alert is making sure congregants are fully informed about the most up-to-date information. “Say you have an alert going on and now the shooter is inside,” Alvarez said. “You want to give continual, updated information so everyone inside can make good decisions based on what’s going on and where the threat is.” That might include locking and barricading doors. But if a shooter breaches the church building, then congregants can “counter” the attack until they’re able to evacuate. You’re throwing whatever you have ― books, bottles, Bibles. “When faced with no other options,” Alvarez said, “you’re going to counter the killer. That could be 30 books coming at his head if it’s at a school, or if it’s a restaurant, then bottles. If it’s a church, you’re throwing whatever you have ― books, bottles, Bibles. The important thing is to hit your target.” Noise, movement and distraction are also important measures that Alvarez said many people forget in the moment of an attack. “Get your shooter off the target, then try to evacuate. In these situations shooters are often reloading, and that’s a time when you can evacuate,” she said. Many churches have pre-emptive security measures in place, she said, and that’s something all organizations should take time to implement. Alvarez urged that churches review their policies and procedures onsuch matters as whether doors are locked during services and whether there’s a security person monitoring any open doors while congregants are inside. Any exterior security volunteers should have a reliable means for communicating with people on the interior ― whether via a headset, handpack radio, or smartphone application. “A lot of churches have volunteer security teams, hopefully led by someone with prior experience in law enforcement or security,” she said. “They might also have civilian security walking the perimeter with bright safety vests on. It’s important not just for shootings but also burglaries, thefts, or in the case where a person is bothering someone.” In a time when mass shootings are becoming increasingly familiar events, Alvarez said the demand for active-shooter training sessions has risen rapidly. Three of the worst mass shootings in modern U.S. history have now occurred in the past 17 months, and Alvarez said every attack adds a sense of urgency to the work she does. “Every time one of these shootings happens, we have to reach more people more quickly,” she said. “Every citizen of the United States needs to have this training because we don’t know where it’s going to happen next.”",1,3,0
296,296,"Four Maryland teenagers were charged with hate crimes after racist graffiti, homophobic slurs and swastikas were discovered spray-painted on a high school campus. The graffiti was found at Glenelg High School on Thursday morning just before an awards ceremony for seniors, the Baltimore Sun reported. Following an investigation, which included reviewing surveillance video, police arrested four senior students: Seth Taylor, 18, of Ellicott City; Tyler Curtiss, 18, of Brookeville; Joshua Shaffer, 18, of Mt. Airy; and Matthew Lipp, 18, of Woodbine, FOX 5 DC reported. SLAIN MARYLAND POLICE OFFICER LAID TO REST The four students face “multiple counts of destruction of property based on race, color, religious belief, sexual orientation, or national origin,” officials told FOX 5 DC. Three of the students were taken into custody from school and the other was picked up by officials from his home. “We will not tolerate this in Howard County,” Superintendent Michael J. Martirano told reporters at a news conference. “We work hard every day to make sure our children are safe and protected. No child, no staff member, within our inclusive community should ever feel any form of threat or harassment or any form of hate,” he continued. The incident was the first hate crime reported at a Howard County school this year. After the graffiti was found, the school’s principal David Burton spoke to students regarding the incident. Officials said some of the graffiti was directed toward Burton. OFFICIALS TRADE BLAME AFTER TEEN ARRESTED IN OFFICER’S DEATH “On what should be a joyous day, when parents and students assemble to celebrate the senior class for its many accomplishments, they were instead confronted with an appalling display of bigotry defacing their school,” Howard County Executive Allan H. Kittleman said at the news conference. He said he had four children who attended the high school and his daughter was currently employed as a teacher at the institution. “I know the sentiments expressed in this terrible graffiti are extremely unsettling to our residents. But we cannot let those who promote hate destroy our important year-end traditions and must remind ourselves that this type of intolerant behavior is the work of a small number of hateful individuals,” Kittleman said in a statement. “They do not represent our shared beliefs as a community. They do not represent our shared values in Howard County. We will not tolerate it and will stand together in condemning this behavior.”",1,0,2
297,297,"U.S. Army 2nd Lt. Richard Collins III, an African-American student at Bowie State University, spent the weekend visiting friends at the University of Maryland. According to the Washington Post, Collins and two of his friends were waiting for an Uber on campus around 3 a.m. on Saturday when they saw a man coming toward them. As Sean Urbanski approached the trio, Fox News reported he repeatedly yelled, “Step left, step left if you know whats best for you.” When the 23-year-old Collins said, “no” and refused to move, Urbanski stabbed him in the chest with a knife. Collins died at the hospital. The assailant fled the scene, but police quickly apprehended him, and Collinss two friends identified him. Police called the attack “totally unprovoked,” and Urbanskis social media revealed another possible, and even more disturbing, motive. During an investigation, police discovered the 22-year-old white male was part of a Facebook page dedicated to “Alt-Reich: Nation.” According to CBS News, University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell said, “It shows extreme bias against women, Latinos, members of the Jewish faith, and especially African-Americans.” Time reported that the FBI has been asked to step in and further investigate what is now being deemed a possible hate crime. Bowie State University Vice President of Student Affairs Artie Travis told CBS News: “Hate has no place in America. Hate has no place on a college campus.” In a statement, University of Maryland President Wallace D. Loh asked for everyones prayers and thoughts for Collinss family “as we search for answers to this senseless crime.” He continued, “We all grieve together for a promising life ended far too early.” As reported by the Washington Post, the 22-year-old University of Maryland student was charged with first- and second-degree murder and first-degree assault. He is being held without bond. Rev. Darryl L. Godlock, pastor at Calvert County Baptist Church in Prince Frederick, Maryland, is serving as the familys spokesman. The Washington Post reported he described Collins as a “fun, loving, young man,” who loved “his family and his God.” Godlock added that his parents are “totally devastated.” He said that Collins “was at the peak of his career about to take off, and his life was taken away senselessly.” Collins had finished his ROTC training and was ready to graduate from Bowie State on Tuesday.

300,300,"LONDON (AP) - A Scottish man who filmed a dog appearing to give Nazi salutes was fined 800 pounds ($1,200) on Monday after being convicted of a hate crime, in a case that has sparked a debate about the limits of free speech. Mark Meechan filmed his girlfriends pug responding to phrases such as sieg heil by raising its paw and posted the footage on YouTube in 2016. Meechan - a comedian and video blogger who uses the name Count Dankula - said the stunt was meant as a joke, but he was convicted last month of posting grossly offensive material. A judge at Scotlands Airdrie Sheriff Court imposed the 800-pound fine Monday. Sheriff Derek OCarroll said the video contained menacing, anti-Semitic and racist material. The dog was filmed responding to the phrase gas the Jews, which was repeated 23 times in the video, OCarroll said. The judge said that while the right to freedom of expression is very important, in all modern democratic countries the law necessarily places some limits on that right. Outside court, Meechan, 30, said his conviction set a really dangerous precedent for free speech and he would appeal. His conviction drew expressions of concern from comedians such as Ricky Gervais. Several far-right commentators also championed Meechans position. Meechan, who described the contents of his YouTube channel as offensive social commentary in an accent you wont understand, said Scottish authorities have ignored the context of the dog video. Its the juxtaposition of having an adorable animal react to something vulgar that was the entire point of the joke, he said.",1,0,3

David Harris, 22, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole immediately after his conviction for the killing of 18-year-old Onésimo Marcelino López-Ramos, the Sun-Sentinel reports. According to the report, prosecutors had accused Harris of carrying out the attack with two other men during a night of “Guat hunting,” a racial slur referring to their plan to rob people of Guatemalan heritage.

305,305,"The Sikh Coalition and local community leaders have asked local, state and federal officials to investigate a Kent shooting as a hate crime. A 39-year-old Sikh man was shot in his driveway at his East Hill home on Friday night after a gunman allegedly told him to “go back to your own country.” The victim is a U.S. citizen, originally from India’s Punjab province, according to Jasmit Singh, a Seattle-area Sikh community leader. The Sikh man, who was identified Sunday on social media sites as Deep Rai, is out of the hospital, recovering from a non-life-threatening injury – a single gunshot wound to the arm – as law enforcement agencies continue their search for the gunman. The shooting was reportedly around 8 p.m. The victim was in his driveway working on his vehicle when he was approached by the unknown man. An altercation ensued and the man was shot, Kent Police said. The shooting reportedly occurred around 8 p.m. The FBI has joined Kent Police and other local law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting. Kent Police Chief Ken Thomas, in a Saturday morning news conference, said his force is using all resources necessary to find the shooter. Authorities are looking for the suspect, described as a 6-foot tall white male with a mask covering the lower half of his face, stocky build and dressed in dark clothing. “We applaud the decision by the Kent Police Department to pursue a hate crime investigation,” said Rajdeep Singh, Sikh Coalition interim program manager, “We are thankful for everything that local authorities are doing to locate the suspect and protect the Sikh community.” The incident is disturbing to the Sikh community. “While we appreciate the efforts of state and local officials to respond to attacks like this, we need our national leaders to make hate crime prevention a top priority,” Rajdeep Singh said. “Tone matters in our political discourse because this a matter of life or death for millions of Americans who are worried about losing loved ones to hate.” According to the coalition, the Sikh American community, which has been an integral part of the American fabric for more than 125 years, is estimated to be hundreds of times more likely to suffer hate crimes than the average American. “Investigating this as an anti-Sikh hate crime is critical because without our government agencies recognizing hatred for what it is, we can’t combat the problem,” Jasmit Singh said. “We are all accountable for what happened in Kent, Washington on Friday night,” Jasmit Singh said. “From the gunman’s family and friends who can help bring him to justice, to our elected officials who create public policy at home and in Washington, D.C., we all must do more to confront this growing epidemic of hate violence.” The Sikh Coalition and local community leaders have also asked local, state and federal officials to improve bias prevention laws, and organize “Know Your Rights” forums to build community resilience and reduce the likelihood of future hate crimes.

306,306,"A neo-Nazi who will face trial for allegedly killing a white woman in an interracial relationship plans to use his great-grandfather as part of his defense. The defense for Travis Ricci, whose murder trial is set to begin June 6, is expected to argue that Ricci isnt the man he once was, in part because he realized his great-grandfather was a member of the French Resistance killed by Nazis in World War II, The Associated Press reported. Authorities are seeking the death penalty for Ricci, who has pleaded not guilty. Ricci is accused of shooting and killing Kelly Ann Jaeger in 2009 when she was with her boyfriend Jeffrey Wellmaker, who is black. Police said Ricci — who was allegedly drunk and shirtless — shouted slurs and threats at the couple, then ran to a home where members of the Vinlanders Social Club, a white supremacist group, were partying. Police said he grabbed a shotgun and, with an accomplice, found the couple and fired two shots, killing Jaeger instead of Wellmaker, his intended target. Before being charged in Jaegers murder, Ricci was arrested for allegedly slamming his girlfriends head into a wall and stabbing two men who came to her defense. He had been sentenced to 22 years in prison for that case and was already locked up when he was arrested on charges in the Jaeger case. His alleged accomplice in the killing, Aaron Schmidt, was tracked down in Tennessee and extradited to Arizona. The two face charges for murder, attempted murder, assisting a gang, drive-by shooting and aggravated assault. Ricci and Schmidt are both said to be members of the Vinlanders Social Club, though their attorneys have denied this. Ricci has tattoos including SS lightning bolts, a swastika, a Hitler-style moustache on one finger and the SS motto Meine Ehre Heisst Treue (my honor is loyalty, a popular slogan for hate groups). Ricci has French citizenship, and in 2014 his defense team enlisted former French justice officials to appeal the death penalty in the case, since France is opposed to putting criminals to death. Jennifer Willmott, one of Riccis defense attorneys, insists that Ricci is not a member of a hate group and called him a very sensitive person who cares about people in general. Riccis lawyer have also said Wellmaker failed to recognize Ricci in a police lineup and even when the two ended up in the same Maricopa County jail in 2011 and played chess together.

Mike Pompeo in Israel Newly-appointed U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not try to meet with any Palestinian officials while in Israel on a diplomatic trip, but emphasized that the U.S. is fully committed to achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace. “We remain committed to achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace that offers a brighter future for both Israel and the Palestinians,” Pompeo said April 29 in Tel Aviv at a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The secretary’s visit comes at one of the most tenuous points in Israeli-Palestinian relations in years, in the wake of continued protests at the Gaza border that have turned violent. Pompeo, a former director of the CIA, was sworn in on April 26 and then left immediately on a diplomatic trip which first took him to NATO headquarters in Brussels. He visited Saudi Arabia on April 28 and the morning of April 29 before landing in Israel on the afternoon of April 29.

Netanyahu on April 30 unveiled copies of half a ton of material that make up part of what he identified as Iran’s secret nuclear files. He first delivered his presentation in English in an effort to reach the widest possible audience. The files, which the Israeli leader calls “new conclusive proof of Iran’s secret nuclear weapons program,” include 55,000 pages of information and 55,000 files on 183 CDs. He said the files had been stored in a secret atomic archive in Tehran, where it was moved last year, locked in massive safes. The original materials, Netanyahu said, “are now in a very safe place.” Netanyahu did not appear to present evidence of ongoing nuclear activity in violation of the deal signed in 2015 between Iran and six world powers, which traded sanctions relief for a rollback of Iran’s nuclear program. President Donald Trump is set to decide by the middle of next month whether it will remain in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the deal is known. Netanyahu said that Israel has shared the information with the United States and “the United States can vouch for its authenticity.” Among the documents, Netanyahu said, is proof of the existence of Project Amad, a program to design, build and test nuclear weapons. The program was scrapped in 2003 after the Gulf War, but work continued in other guises and with the same personnel, according to Netanyahu, citing the documents. Other documents also proved that the Fordow uranium enrichment facility was not intended to produce medical isotopes but uranium for nuclear weapons. Netanyahu said he is certain that Trump will “do the right thing” in deciding whether to stay in the nuclear deal.

They dubbed their kippah action “Kopf Hoch” – which means “Keep your head high,” or “Cheer Up.” Initially, more parks were included in the plan. But the Berlin police advised the organizers not to carry out their action in the Kreuzberg and Neukoeln districts. Both areas have large Arab populations, and some recent anti-Semitic incidents in Berlin have been attributed to people of Arab background. Volunteers started handing out the yarmulkes early afternoon April 29. Within an hour, the green lawns of Monbijou Park in the Mitte District were dotted with kippah wearers, lounging on the grass, picnicking, or otherwise enjoying a sunny day. The event follows a kippah “flash mob” and a rally last week, which drew some 2,500 concerned Berliners to the doorstep of the Jewish community center in former west Berlin.

He also noted the Nobel prizes won by Jewish Americans. Trump said that the American Jewish community “is a shining example of how enshrining freedom of religion and protecting the rights of minorities can strengthen a nation. Through their rich culture and heritage, the Jewish people have triumphed over adversity and enhanced our country. For this and many other reasons, the American Jewish community is deserving of our respect, recognition, and gratitude.” –-JTA Ashley Judd sues Harvey Weinstein Ashley Judd sued Harvey Weinstein on April 30, saying the former movie mogul hurt her acting career in retaliation for her rejecting his sexual advances, according to CBS News. In the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Judd accuses Weinstein of defamation, sexual harassment and violating California’s unfair competition law. Judd was in the first group of women who came forward last fall about Weinstein’s sexual misconduct, putting her at the forefront of the #MeToo movement. Central to the suit is director Peter Jackson saying in December that Weinstein had warned him 20 years ago that Judd was a “nightmare” to work with, and should be avoided “at all costs.” Jackson was considering Judd for a major role in his “Lord of the Rings” movies, and had met with her about the role. Weinstein’s company at the time, Miramax, then held the rights to “Lord of the Rings.” About a year earlier, at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, Weinstein — in what was supposed to be a business breakfast meeting — appeared in a bathrobe, asked Judd to watch him shower and to let him massage her, the suit alleges. Judd, 50, had no idea why she wasn’t cast in the “Lord of the Rings” films until Jackson came forward last year, the lawsuit says. Weinstein has denied trying to derail Judd’s career, and said he had no role in Jackson’s casting. The Reuters news agency reports a Weinstein representative issued a statement saying he had “neither defamed Ms. Judd nor ever interfered with Ms. Judd’s career.” Read more: Ashley Judd sues Harvey Weinstein for defamation, sexual harassment J-Word of the Day: Tzaddik (Hebrew) Meaning: A righteous soul, an exceptionally good person Usage: “My zayde [grandfather], of blessed memory, he was a real tzaddik to everyone he met.” Change Agents Be sure to read Jmore’s May cover story on Jewish women charting a new course.

309,309,"Monmouth police are investigating vandalism at a golf course as a possible hate crime, after a swastika was carved into the first green. MONMOUTH (WGME) -- Police are investigating vandalism at a golf course as a possible hate crime, after a swastika was carved into the first green. Tuesday was a beautiful day at Cobbossee Colony Golf Course, but an ugly symbol was discovered some 24 hours earlier. One swastika etched into the green, said Bill Sylvester, one of the owners. And thats not all. Sylvester said vandals did more damage with a golf cart they brought from home. Mostly it was just tire tracks all over the greens where they came in and did donuts, he said. They jumped over sand traps. They had a lot of fun doing that, I think. Half a dozen flags were broken. They were sitting in the cup and they drove right over them, he said. Sylvester said vandalism was discovered on six out of nine holes. He believes it happened between 9:30 p.m. Sunday and 4 a.m. Monday. I was a little upset, but it can be fixed, Sylvester said. Its not the worst thing in the world. Police said they have three suspects but not enough evidence to charge them. Sylvester doesnt know why the swastika was left. Police said if charges are brought, the case will be forwarded to the Attorney Generals Office as a possible hate crime, defined under Maine law as, criminal conduct motivated by bias, based on things like race and religion. I suppose it could be if they wanted it to, but I think its just a stupid crime, and maybe bad parenting or something like that, Sylvester said. Damage is estimated in the thousands, but that doesnt include loss of business. Because golfers cant play every green, theyre paying less per round. Sylvester is just glad this happened later in the season. Hes planning to invest in surveillance cameras. I hope they get a life, he said. Anyone with information is asked to call police.",1,0,2
315,315,"CHICAGO — A Chicago man seen on video harassing a woman for wearing a Puerto Rican flag shirt while police watched was hit with felony hate crime charges Thursday. Timothy Trybus, 62, was arrested Thursday and faces two counts of felony hate crime over the encounter in an Illinois forest preserve, a spokesperson with the Cook County States Attorney Office said. He was initially charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct and misdemeanor assault before his charges were upgraded. Trybus is scheduled to appear in court on Friday. Each count is a class 3 felony that carries a possible sentence of probation or up to two to five years in prison if convicted. It was not immediately clear if Trybus is represented by an attorney. Timothy Trybus, 62, faces two felony hate crime charges. COOK COUNTY FOREST PRESERVE POLICE The June 14 incident showed an irate man who police later identified as Trybus approaching a woman, Mia Irizarry, as she waited for her family at a picnic area in the Forest Preserves of Cook County to celebrate her 24th birthday. Trybus told Irizarry, who was filming the confrontation, not to wear a T-shirt celebrating Puerto Rico if shes an American citizen -- despite the fact that Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. You should not be wearing that in the United States of America, he said. Are you a citizen? Yes I am, Irizarry replied. Then you should not be wearing that. You should be wearing United States of America flag, he said. Officer Patrick Connor of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County police arrived, but the video shows he didnt intervene even as the Trybus invaded Irizarrys personal space and continued to harangue her. Irizarry is seen in the video filing a formal complaint and says that the initial responding officer did absolutely zero. Connor was placed on desk duty on June 26, after apparently taking a pre-scheduled vacation shortly after the incident. He resigned on his own accord Wednesday. Tap here for more from CBS News.

318,318,"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. - In a shocking incident reminiscent of the hatred in parts of the south in the 1960s, the NYPD has launched an investigation after vandals scratched the phrase n----- get out into the hood of the car of a black family on the South Shore of Staten Island. In addition to the disgusting phrase, move b---h was written on the trunk of a 2012 Volkswagen 4-door sedan, which was parked on the street in front of a home on Sneden Avenue near Seguine Place in Annadale, according to an NYPD spokesman. The vehicle also was scratched in other places and the headlights were damaged, the police spokesman said. Police were called at about 9 a.m. on Wednesday to the location and talked to the the 42-year-old male victim whose car apparently was vandalized sometime overnight, the spokesman said. The NYPDs Hate Crimes task force is investigating. No arrests have been made at this time, the police spokesman said. A GoFundMe page has been started to pay for repairs for the victim by neighbor Annette Siewert. How naive I felt this morning when we woke up to quite possibly the most heinous act weve witnessed together as neighbors, Siewert wrote on GoFundMe. Something that catapulted us back decades of progress. Our neighbor, whose name hes asked me to keep private, was victim of a hate crime. The vandal scratched his hatred all over his vehicle. From bumper to bumper, she wrote on the GoFundMe page. The victim has rented on the block for more than a year, according to Siewert. Hes a stand up guy who takes care of his family, Siewert wrote. This hard working father of 4 (who ages range from 3 months to 16 years old) is involved and dedicated to his family. He had to borrow someone elses car this morning to avoid having to explain to his 9 year old what happened. While insurance likely will pay for the repairs, the victim will have to pay a deductible, Siewert said. Donations will go toward the deductible and any additional funds will pay for a family vacation, Siewert told the Advance. This expense is not only unexpected but it shouldnt be his responsibility, Siewert wrote. Im asking for monetary help in any way you can. No donation is too small. There has to be more good than evil in this world. Lets restore his faith in humanity, together!",1,0,2
319,319,"ROCHESTER HILLS, Mich. — A Michigan man is out on bail after police said he fired a shotgun at a teenager who had stopped at his house to ask directions. Jeffrey Craig Zeigler, 53, was charged Friday, April 13 with assault with intent to murder and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. During Zeigler’s arraignment, Judge Julie Nicholson entered a plea of not guilty for him. The teen’s mother told CNN affiliate WDIV she thought there was a racial component to the case. The teen is black and the man is white. “It definitely was a hate crime,” she said. Brennan Walker, 14, said he was walking alone to school Thursday after he missed the bus. As he trekked the 4 miles to Rochester High School in Rochester Hills, he got lost and knocked on the doors of several houses, he said. The teen said he went up to one home and knocked on the door a few times. A woman came to the door, yelling at him, he told WDIV. “I was trying to explain to that I wanted to get directions to go to my school,” he said. The man eventually came out with a shotgun and fired one shot at the teen who was running away. The teen said he fled when he saw the man with the shotgun. The teen was not wounded. Deputies responded to a call of a male trying to break into a house, the sheriff’s department said in a news release. Both the boy and Zeigler were taken to a police station and questioned. Zeigler was arrested A prosecutor said at Zeigler’s arraignment that there was a surveillance video from the house that caused her to doubt Zeigler’s recollection of the incident. His story was not borne out by the video, she said. Zeigler was released Friday from Oakland County Jail on a $50,000 bond. A judge also ordered the man to stay more than 10 miles from the teenager, which means he will likely have to live elsewhere until trial. He was also ordered to turn over all his firearms and wear a GPS monitor. Zeigler told the judge that there is “a lot more to the story than what’s being told.” CNN was unable to locate an attorney for Zeigler. “America still suffers from an illness rooted in an assumption fueled by a false perception and sustained by our racial condition,” said Detroit Branch NAACP President Rev. Wendell Anthony. The recent shooting at 14-year-old Brennan Walker, at a home in Rochester Hills, while simply trying to find his way to school, by a white homeowner, is another case in point.” Zeigler is due in court April 24 for a probable cause conference. The maximum sentence for someone convicted of assault with the intent to commit murder is life in prison.",1,0,0
321,321,"A 40-year-old Brooklyn man was indicted earlier this month on charges of assault as a hate crime after he allegedly hit a transgendered woman with a chair inside a Bed-Stuy homeless shelter on Christmas day. According to the investigation, at approximately 6:15 p.m. on December 25, the victim – a 31-year-old trans female and resident of the shelter, located at 357 Marcus Garvey Boulevard – was walking down a hallway towards the bathroom when she heard someone running toward her from behind. She then allegedly turned and saw the defendant – Kane Sekou, of Bed-Stuy – running toward her with a chair, which he is said to have used to strike the victim across the back. He allegedly did all this while yelling homophobic slurs at her, which he is said to have continued making even when police arrived. Sekou was ordered held on $20,000 bail and is to return to court on March 14. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the top count. “This cowardly and unprovoked attack in which an innocent woman was assaulted simply because she is transgendered is despicable,” said District Attorney Eric Gonzalez. “In Brooklyn, we will not tolerate bias-motivated crimes of any kind. We now intend to hold the defendant accountable.” The case was investigated by New York City Police Department Hate Crimes Task Force.",1,2,0
322,322,"Michael Christopher Estes is accused of planting an improvised explosive device Oct. 6 at the airport in Asheville, N.C. Credit: Buncombe County Detention Center via Associated Press i In this week’s Hate Report: Three white men have been charged with building bombs recently, the FBI’s much-awaited hate crime stats show an uptick, and a white supremacist campaign helped elect a black town board member. Last month, Michael Christopher Estes planted an ammonium nitrate and fuel oil bomb packed with nails and bullets in the concourse at the Asheville Regional Airport in North Carolina. Estes openly admitted to authorities that he was “preparing to fight a war on U.S. soil.” Last week, prosecutors announced federal charges against Elijah Blankenship of Akron, Ohio, who was found with a pipe bomb in August, a few hours before a planned vigil for victims of the violent white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia. Earlier this week, Christopher S. Langer of Florida was found to have been making bombs in his home. The local sheriff said Langer hated the government and planned to use a grenade on first responders. “He has all the components in there to make a weapon of mass destruction,” the sheriff told local media. In a story on The Intercept about the Asheville case, writer Shaun King summed up why he thinks some thwarted terror attacks get huge amounts of attention, while others largely are ignored by the media and general public: The story didn’t go viral and Trump didn’t tweet about it because the bomb was not placed by an immigrant, or a Muslim, or a Mexican. King continues: A Muslim attacker’s mugshot would become a meme across the conservative media. Mainstream American outlets would be covering the heroic bravery of those who thwarted the terrorist plot. … In this case, though? Crickets. We hear nothing at all — almost exclusively because the man who planted an improvised explosive device, just like ones that have been used to murder and maim people all over the world, was white. These kinds of right-wing domestic terrorists were behind nearly twice as many violent plots as Islamist terrorists in the United States in the last nine years, we found earlier this year in our investigation with The Investigative Fund. But law enforcement sting operations were much more likely to be focused on Islamist terror. That highlights another major issue: Under President Donald Trump, the country’s domestic terrorism efforts appear to be crumbling, according to an op-ed piece in The Washington Post this week. As we have detailed in The Hate Report, the Trump administration has dismantled the Countering Violent Extremism program, which aimed to tackle potential terrorists via grassroots organizations. The 2018 budget also defunds $10 million in grants for the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Community Partnerships, which similarly aims to target homegrown terrorists like the men above. Almost a year after Trump took office, his plan to tackle domestic terrorism is “missing in action,” according to the Post piece. The piece quotes former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson: It’s critical that the U.S. government engage those communities in the homeland from which terrorist organizations may seek to recruit. I’m concerned that these efforts are atrophying. Hate crimes jumped at the end of 2016 On Monday, the FBI released its annual Hate Crime Statistics Report, which catalogues bias-motivated criminal incidents across the U.S. for 2016. It showed the nation’s law enforcement agencies reported 6,121 incidents motivated by race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry or disability. That’s a nearly 5 percent increase over what was reported in 2015 and a 10 percent jump from 2014. Compared with estimates based on surveys from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the FBI’s figures vastly underrepresent the full scale of hate crimes nationwide, likely due to 88 percent of law enforcement agencies not reporting a single hate incident to the FBI in 2016. Even so, the report is illuminating. About 58 percent of cases were motivated by race, with black people being the most frequent victims. Twenty-one percent were motivated by religion, with Jews making up the largest share of victims in that group. The most dramatic increase, a 25 percent jump over the previous year, occurred in the last three months of last year. As CNN notes, there’s usually a significant decrease in hate crimes during final quarter of the year, but 2016 was an exception. These figures add fuel to the idea that Trump’s campaign played a role in unleashing a wave of hate. Everything you ever wanted to know about Andrew Anglin How did a vegan hippie in a “fuck racism” hoodie come to run an influential neo-Nazi website, The Daily Stormer? Writing in The Atlantic, Luke O’Brien dives deep into Andrew Anglin’s history and future: Anglin and his ilk like to talk about the Overton Window, a term that describes the range of acceptable discourse in society. They’d been tugging at that window for years only to watch, with surprise and delight, as it flew wide open during Donald Trump’s candidacy. Suddenly it was okay to talk about banning Muslims or to cast Mexican immigrants as criminals and parasites – which meant Anglin’s even-more-extreme views weren’t as far outside the mainstream as they once had been. Here’s what that ideology entails: Like many young men on the extreme right, Anglin hadn’t just given up on the idea of the United States as a liberal democracy. He wanted to burn it to the ground. “There is rapidly approaching a time when in every White Western city, corpses will be stacked in the streets as high as men can stack them,” he wrote. “And you are either going to be stacking or getting stacked.” Anglin is currently on trial for facilitating a mass harassment campaign against a Jewish family in Montana. Since the trial began in April, Anglin has made himself scarce. The people suing him haven’t been able to find him to serve him with the lawsuit. He insisted he was living in Nigeria, but we debunked the evidence he provided to prove it. Without showing up to mount a defense, Anglin faced the possibility of having the judge simply rule against him, forcing him to pay damages to victims. However, on Tuesday, Anglin’s legal team finally filed its first motion in the case – meaning Anglin’s side appears willing to push back against the allegations. The case not only could set important precedent about whether trolls are liable for the emotional pain they cause, but also has the potential to push The Daily Stormer off the internet for good. We reached out to Anglin’s lawyer, Matthew Stevenson, for comment but did not receive a response. A trio of anti-gay attacks A man selling the homeless advocacy newspaper Street Spirit was punched in the face while trying to protect a lesbian couple in Berkeley, California. The couple and their 10-year-old daughter were waiting at a cafe when a homeless man started threatening them. When none of the other patrons stepped up, Berkeleyside reports , the newspaper vendor confronted the attacker. The family had moved to Berkeley from Charlottesville, Virginia, five years ago, hoping to escape the prejudice they said they encountered there. A lesbian couple in Los Angeles was targeted and assaulted Oct. 30. One of the victims, Sabrina Hooks, suffered a black eye and broken tooth. “The best I could describe, it was like a horror film,” she told Fox 11 News . Trevon Godbolt was arrested after allegedly stripping another man of all his clothes and possessions, leaving him to walk the streets of Muskegon Heights, Michigan, naked and alone. As Fox 17 reports , authorities believe the victim was targeted due to his sexual orientation. Hate couture If America knows how to do one thing really well, it is to capitalize on current trends to make money. It turns out the division among Americans, and the corresponding hate, is no exception. For example, we noted this week that Walmart had been selling a T-shirt aimed at veterans who hate anti-fascists, better known as the antifa: The shirt has since been removed from the site. But it’s not just those who hate the antifa who can get their sloganed clothing ready-made. Barneys New York has been lambasted in recent weeks for selling a jacket inspired by the antifa movement. Adorned with slogans such as, “Protect what you love,” and anarchist logos, the jacket has since been taken off the Barneys website, but we have a photo, courtesy of The Daily Dot. Oh, and the price of this jacket? $375. ‘Protest is nice, but systematic change is better’ Earlier this month, Kevin Beckford became the first African American elected to the Town Board of Pittsford, New York. Beckford’s path began last year. After white supremacist fliers appeared around town, he joined a protest march. During that march, Beckford asked organizers how he could help. Together with the march’s organizers, Beckford founded the pro-diversity group PittsForward, which became a jumping-off point for his run for Town Board. Despite meeting some racist resistance, such as having his campaign website hacked and warnings from local police about being targeted for racial violence, Beckford emerged victorious. “Protest is nice,” he told the Democrat & Chronicle, “but systematic change is better.” Corrections: A previous version of this story misstated Charlottesville’s location. It is in Virginia. A previous version also misstated the date and location of an attack on a lesbian couple. It occurred Oct. 30 in Los Angeles. Sign up to get The Hate Report by email every Friday.

326,326,"In September, Sharie Thompson received a racist note taped to the front door of her Elk Grove salon, threatening that a “coon hunt” was coming for the African American hair stylist and her staff. “Gonna get ya soon” read the note, written in black crayon. The incident was one of 25 hate crimes reported by law enforcement in Sacramento County last year, according to a report released this week by the state Department of Justice. Since 2014, hate crimes in Sacramento County increased by 66 percent, mirroring a statewide uptick. The number of hate crimes reported in California jumped more than 17 percent from 2016 to 2017, the third straight year of double-digit increases. Local law enforcement agencies across California reported 1,093 hate crimes last year, the first time since 2011 that the number has exceed 1,000. Be the first to know. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, youll never miss a local story. SIGN ME UP! “In America right now ... do I feel safe?” Thompson said this week. “Absolutely not.” Thompson said that while she hasn’t received any more letters, she has since experienced other incidents of racial harassment. In the city of Sacramento, there were five official hate crimes in 2017 — though police said there were many more documented incidents that didn’t rise to the level of chargeable offenses. The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department reported 11 hate crimes, but could not immediately provide details. Elk Grove reported four events — including Thompson’s. No arrest has been made in her incident, but the investigation remains open, said Elk Grove Police Department spokesman Jason Jimenez. Both Citrus Heights and Rancho Cordova reported two hate crimes each. One was reported by the UC Davis Medical Center. In Placer County, Roseville reported 19 hate crimes. While the most common motivator for hate crimes was an individual’s race or ethnicity, crimes involving bias against religion and sexual orientation also increased. Basim Elkarra, director of the Sacramento chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said his organization has seen “a historic rise in hate crimes and all hate incidents around the country.” Locally, “we deal with so many cases,” Elkarra said. “There are hate letters that come into the mosques on a regular basis. Things are happening all the time.” Elkarra’s office was the target of one of those incidents. Last June, a container with a copy of the Muslim holy book, the Quran, submerged in lard, was mailed to his office. “I’m not surprised in this current environment that people are thinking that because they know that Muslims don’t eat pork that it is going to hurt us or affect us,” he said. “I was disappointed that people would be willing to waste money to spread hate.” Sacramento Police Department spokesman Eddie Macaulay said that Elkarra’s incident didn’t involve a crime (and is therefore not in the statistics reported by the Department of Justice), but the department investigated it anyway. They found the likely mailer in Texas, tracing the package through Federal Express and using surveillance footage from where it was mailed. “It’s distasteful and it’s wrong; however, the criminality on the face value is probably not there,” Macaulay said. “(But) that person is now in our system and on our radar.” Macaulay said the department is asking people to report all bias encounters and pushing for more transparency around hate crimes in order to encourage more victims to report them — even if the events don’t rise to the level of a crime. Last month, the department began posting reported incidents on its website as part of a national project with The Police Foundation, a law enforcement think tank. Macaulay said in coming weeks, the department will add more than a dozen other incidents to that database to reflect all encounters in which the victim feels bias was a factor — the standard Sacramento officers are required to use to classify hate crimes and incidents. “We show what is actually being reported so people can see (that) this is occurring and we are looking into it,” he said. “The ultimate goal is ... to make people more comfortable reporting.” One reason for the increase in hate crimes may be more people coming forward to report them, as well as protocols such as Sacramento’s mandating how officers flag bias complaints, said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. David Heitstuman, executive director of the Sacramento LGBT Community Center, said hate crimes can have effects on the entire community, making both reporting and follow up by authorities essential. “It is simply their existence that has caused another person to commit a crime against them, and that is something you can’t outrun, you can’t hide from,” Heitstuman said. When crimes aren’t fully investigated and prosecuted, “the importance of that incident is diminished and psychologically to our community, (LGBT people) feel their value is diminished as well,” Heitstuman said. Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert did not prosecute any hate crimes in 2017, though seven were referred to her office, according to the state report. Four of those cases were prosecuted without the hate crimes charges. The Department of Justice report showed 50 percent of cases in California referred to prosecutors in 2017 as hate crimes were prosecuted with those charges, a decline from 56 percent the previous year. Sacramento County District Attorney’s spokeswoman Shelly Orio said the person who handles such cases was out of the office, and Orio was unable to provide details on why hate crime charges were not pursued. The office is prosecuting at least one hate crime this year in the case of two men assaulted in a bar during an attack that left one victim with a “useless” eye and involved homophobic slurs, according to court documents. The defendant in that case, Valentino Valles, faces a preliminary hearing Friday. Levin said it was not uncommon for district attorneys to drop the hate charges and pursue only the underlying event because it can be harder to win convictions on hate crimes. Heitstuman said it was “troublesome” that none of the referred cases were prosecuted as hate crimes. “It’s really frustrating,” he said. “If the prosecutor doesn’t pursue it as a hate crime, and you are sort of made to feel like you should be happy that something is happening to this person ... that is essentially (bias) being tolerated.” While the majority of bias-related incidents occur on streets or near victims’ homes, the Department of Justice report also noted increases at schools and playgrounds. Incidents at grade schools accounted for close to 8 percent of the 1,093 cases reported in California last year. In 2017, the number of hate crimes in schools leaped from 42 to 68 — a 39 percent increase from the year before. Statewide, there has been a 102 percent increase over the past four years in the number of reported hate crimes at places of worship, such as churches, temples and synagogues. Elkarra said his organization has tracked an upturn in bullying of Muslim students in Sacramento and three other large California cities and found a dramatic increase in past years, “especially (among) young ladies who wear the head scarf,” he said. A 2016-2017 study of more than 1,000 Muslim students ages 11-18 found that 36 percent of girls said they’d had their head scarves tugged, pulled or offensively touched, up 7 percentage points since a prior survey in 2014. Nineteen percent of Muslim kids surveyed said they had been physically harmed or harassed at school because of their religion, up 10 percentage points from the prior survey. Levin said he attributes that jump to young people mimicking adult behavior. “Kids will parrot what they see in the mainstream,” he said. “We are now having intense manifestations of bigotry and incivility in socio-political discourse.” Orlando Fuentes, an Elk Grove resident who is running for City Council, said he sees a connection between rhetoric in national politics and incidents in the local community. Fuentes said he believes President Donald Trump’s invective language is a contributing factor to less civility among citizens. Trump ran a campaign that challenged the notion of “political correctness” and has attacked people in his speeches and on social media. “It’s that kind of demeaning discourse that is concerning,” Fuentes said. “It’s frequent and daily.” According to Heitstuman, “the Trump effect really has emboldened people to speak their hateful minds in a ... way, and that is leading to more action.” Levin said that while the president’s rhetoric has had a measurable correlation with hate crimes at specific times (including a spike in Muslim hate crimes immediately following a speech by Trump announcing the proposed Muslim travel ban, according to his research), the reasons for the increasing numbers likely are more complicated. He points out that hate crimes began rising in 2014, before Trump was in office. “Breathtaking” diversity in California, viral incidents on social media, a growing presence of hate groups in the state and breakdowns in trust in institutions such as the government and the press likely are factors, he said. “I don’t want to let politicians totally off the hook,” Levin said. “When we have negative stereotypes about different groups, and there is a drumbeat that has entered the social and political mainstream, that is going to have an effect.”",1,0,3

328,328,"As expected, Prince Georges County State’s Attorney Angela Alsobrooks will pursue the maximum penalty — a life sentence without parole — against 23-year-old Severna Park native Sean Urbanski in the murder of a Bowie State University student. Urbanski was indicted in July on one count of common law murder following a May 20 stabbing attack at a bus stop on the campus of the University of Maryland, College Park. That attack killed 23-year-old 2nd Lt. Richard Wilbur Collins III. The common law murder charge covers both first- and second-degree murder, manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter. “The reason the states attorney made this (sentencing) decision was that this was an unprovoked attack,” said John Erzen, a spokesman for the state’s attorney’s office. “This was someone, who for no apparent reason, walked up to another person and stabbed him in the chest. (Alsobrooks) feels this deserves the harshest possible penalty if Mr. Urbanski is convicted of first-degree murder.” William C. Brennan Jr., the attorney for Urbanski, was not immediately available for comment. Urbanski has been held without bond since his arrest. Alsobrooks had initially indicated that she would pursue the maximum penalty, and an official statement of intent was filed earlier this week. Collins, a Bowie State student, was visiting friends on campus when he encountered Urbanski at the bus stop on campus at about 3 a.m. May 20. Urbanski allegedly stabbed Collins after demanding that he “step left, step left if you know whats good for you.” Collins and his friends looked at Urbanski, puzzled, police said, and Collins told him “no.” At that point, Urbanski allegedly stabbed Collins in his chest, police said. Police said after the arrest that the FBI was investigating the possibility of hate-bias as a motive, a move prompted by Urbanski’s connections to a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich,” which posted language and viewpoints police described as racist. Both the FBI and the state’s attorney’s office are conducting an investigation to determine if the incident qualifies as a hate crime under either federal or state law — or both. The state’s attorney’s office expects to make an announcement on the results of those investigations in the next month or so. The maximum penalty for a state hate crime conviction is five years, Erzen said. “I would hope that by the time we get to the end of September, we would be able to make an announcement (on the hate crime charge) one way or the other, but it’s not all in our hands,” he said. Collins, of Calvert County, was scheduled to graduate with a degree in business from Bowie State just days after the stabbing, and was commissioned in the Army a few weeks earlier. He was a member of the Bowie State ROTC program. His family accepted his degree at the commencement ceremony, and a black gown was draped across a chair in the front row in Collins’ honor. Students, faculty and staff at the University of Maryland, College Park observed a moment of silence Wednesday in honor of Richard Collins III, a Bowie State University student and ...

329,329,"A judge sentenced a Georgia man and woman Monday to a combined 35 years in jail after the couple terrorized African-American guests at a child’s birthday party with racial slurs and threats while riding in a truck with Confederate battle flags in 2015, reports The Atlanta-Journal Constitution. From The Atlanta-Journal Constitution: Superior Court Judge William McClain castigated the two, Kayla Rae Norton, 25, and Jose Ismael Torres, 26, for perpetrating what he called a hate crime. He sentenced Torres to 20 years, with 13 to serve in prison; Norton was given 15 years, with six to serve. Upon their release, McClain ordered them to be permanently banished from Douglas County. “Their actions were motivated by racial hatred,” said McClain. Assistant District Attorney David Emadi detailed how the group [Respect The Flag] had gone on a drunken, two-county rampage in pick-up trucked laden with Confederate battle flags through Paulding and Douglas counties over July 24 and July 25. Emadi said the group threatened African-American motorists, yelled at them and walked up to one of their cars with a gun …Hyesha Bryant, 34, offered forgiveness to Norton and Torres. She had attended the party, an 8-year-old’s celebration complete with a jumpy castle and snow cone machine. She also reminded them of the choices they made over two days that ultimately led them to McClain’s packed Douglas County courtroom… “As adults and parents, we have to instill in our children the values of right and wrong [, Byrant said.] That moment you had to choose to leave, you stayed.” Then Bryant clutched her chest, leaned forward toward Torres and Norton and looked them in the eyes. “I forgive all of you,” she said. “I don’t have any hate in my heart. Life is too short for that.” The horrible incident involving the pair, who were convicted earlier this month under a street gang terrorism law, happened a little more than a month after convicted mass-murderer Dylann Roof killed nine parishioners in the Emanuel AME massacre in Charleston, South Carolina, reports the New York Daily News.

332,332,"At trial, witnesses testified that Mark Olic Porter yelled at the boy, “Get out of here, nigger,” as the child rode his scooter around a courtyard at Adagio, a 500-unit apartment complex in Draper, Utah, a Salt Lake City suburb, in November 2016. The boy’s father, Mike Waldvogel, testified he heard the yelling and came outdoors to get his son, then heard Porter yell, “You and your nigger son can get out of here.” Seconds later as he passed Porter, Waldvogel said he was assaulted on his neck by an electrified Zap Cane and “felt pain that pretty much incapacitated me,” the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Porter fought with police before they arrested him on third-degree-felony aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of assault against a police officer, interference with arresting officers and intoxication. The state charges were dropped when federal authorities took over the investigation and obtained a grand jury indictment against Porter last September. He was convicted of using force and threats to injury, intimidate and interfere with an African-American man because of his race and occupancy in the apartment complex. The 59-year-old defendant faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he is sentenced in May by U.S. District Judge Dee Benson. Porter “did these terrible things because he hates black people and he didn’t want them living in his community,” Assistant U.S. Attorney J. Drew Yeates said in closing arguments. “He went after a first-grade boy because his skin was black,” the prosecutor told the jury. Defense attorneys argued to the jury that the incident was not racially motivated but was triggered because of tensions that exist in high-density housing. Prosecutors rebutted that, calling witnesses who testified about Porter’s dislike of African Americans. A leasing agent testified that Porter, when he moved in, asked how many black families lived at the complex. Later, when an apartment unit above his became vacant, maintenance workers testified, Porter told them not to move “any more niggers in there.” And Porter’s neighbor testified that Porter had told her he wanted to “exterminate” all black people. It took the jury only four hours to return the conviction. Afterwards, John Huber, the U.S. Attorney for Utah, applauded the outcome. “This crime of hatred is one that cannot be tolerated at all in the state of Utah and the United States,” he said. “Today, the jury spoke on behalf of the community, and their verdict of guilty sends a clear message to this defendant and other people who may act like him that in Utah, this is not welcome.”",1,0,3

Federal prosecutors say 28-year-old Diego Martinez entered the plea Thursday for statements made during an FBI interview in October 2015.

Martinez admitted he gave a false alibi to the FBI for his whereabouts when the attack occurred, and falsely said his cellphone wasn’t working at the time.

334,334," Jaganmohan Reddy, father of Alok Madasani, an engineer who was wounded in the shooting Wednesday night in a suburban Kansas City bar, speaks to reporters at his residence in Hyderabad, India, on Feb. 24. (Mahesh Kumar/AP) NEW DELHI — Family members of the Indian men shot at an Olathe, Kan., bar Wednesday in a possible hate crime said they feared that an atmosphere of fear and xenophobia in the United States means the country is not a safe place for Indians, with one Indian father exhorting parents not to send their children there. “There is a kind of hysteria spreading that is not good because so many of our beloved children live there,” said Venu Madhav, a relative of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, the young software engineer fatally shot Wednesday night. “Such hatred is not good for people.” Kuchibhotla and his friend and colleague Alok Madasani, 32, were at a bar crowded with patrons watching a basketball game Wednesday, witnesses said, when an allegedly drunken man began hurling racial slurs at them and then opened fire, reportedly shouting, “Get out of my country!” [He yelled ‘Get out of my country,’ witnesses say, and then shot 2 men from India, killing one] Kuchibhotla, 32, was seriously wounded in the attack and died later at a hospital. Madasani and a third victim — Ian Grillot, who had tried to intervene — were treated for shotgun wounds at a hospital. Ian Grillot was shot in the hand and chest at a restaurant in Olathe, Kan., after trying to subdue a man who opened fire on two other diners. One of them, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, later died from his wounds. (Youtube/KUHospital) Adam W. Purinton, 51, of Olathe, a Navy veteran, was later arrested and charged with first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder. Federal law enforcement officials said Thursday that they and local police are investigating to determine whether the shootings were “bias motivated.” Witnesses said Purinton seemed to be under the impression that the men were of Middle Eastern descent. Family members of the victims living in the southern city of Hyderabad told the Hindustan Times that the two friends — software engineers with the Olathe-based Garmin — had not antagonized Purinton, and that Purinton had “picked an argument” with the men, suggesting that they were staying in the United States illegally. “They tried to tell him that they had done their [master’s degrees] in Kansas in 2006 and had been staying there with valid work permits,” a relative said. Kuchibhotla and Madasani were employees on the Aviation Systems Engineering team at Garmin. According to Kuchibhotla’s LinkedIn account, he held a master’s degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the University of Texas at El Paso and a bachelor’s degree from the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University in India. Madasani’s LinkedIn said he studied at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and at Vasavi College of Engineering in India. Madasani’s father, Jaganmohan Reddy, told the Hindustan Times that in recent months, he had begun to ask his son to return home, fearing that he might not be safe in the country’s racially charged atmosphere, with ugly incidents and hate groups on the rise. Jagan Mohan Reddy holds up a smartphone with an image of his son, Alok Madasani, at his residence in Hyderabad on Feb. 24. (Noah Seelam/AFP/Getty Images) “The situation seems to be pretty bad after Trump took over as the U.S. president. I appeal to all the parents in India not to send their children to the United States in the present circumstances,” Reddy said. Madhav told The Post in an interview that Kuchibhotla’s family was in shock, and that it was the third such possible hate crime in recent weeks that has affected members of the Telugu-speaking Southern Indian community in the United States. “Something has changed in the United States,” he said. “Such things are not good for the Indian community living here.” In India, the minister of external affairs, Sushma Swaraj, said she was “shocked” by the attack and “rushed” two diplomats to Kansas from the Indian Consulate in Houston. Meanwhile, cable news channels debated whether the United States was now a danger zone for those with brown skin. “Is this the new normal?” an anchor on NDTV news channel wondered. An estimated 300,000 Indians are working in the United States on H-1B high-skilled worker visas, most in the business outsourcing and software industries.

335,335,"Everyday people feel sting of hatred Newsday published news of a drop in reported hate crimes across Long Island [“Hate crime drop on LI,” News, March 20]. However, the article mentioned that advocacy groups are concerned that many hate crimes go unreported. Two recent observations in my life confirm these concerns. One happened to an assistant in my physician’s office who is of Asian descent. She told me that a person screamed at her in the local supermarket to go back to her own country. Another happened to a woman of Hispanic descent. She was spit at by a person screaming racial epithets from a moving car as she walked down the street. Both women were born here and are U.S. citizens. Before we congratulate ourselves, we need to examine this serious problem from more than just a statistical viewpoint. Community policing should include an ear to the ground regarding what is happening to everyday citizens.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy. Pruitt’s claim that “there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact” is simply false. But falsehoods, so-called alternative facts, are what we’ve come to expect from the Trump administration. It’s obvious that President Donald Trump, Pruitt and some members of Congress deny climate change science to justify drilling every bit of oil and gas, which most scientists say must stay in the ground if we are to survive on a livable planet. The carrot these deniers dangle, as always, is jobs. But we should not have to do jobs that dig our children’s graves when there are jobs to be had developing a renewable, clean energy economy. We need all legislators to reject funding cuts to the EPA and work to strengthen, not undermine, policies that fight climate change. It’s time for our government to stop working for the fossil fuel industry and start working for us and our children. Amy K.

Lefkowitz, East Meadow Suspicious about firing of Bharara I was deeply disappointed by the termination of Preet Bharara as U.S. attorney for the Southern District [“Final office visit for fired Bharara,” News, March 14]. Bharara demonstrated integrity and courage, which we need badly. He didn’t seem to have a partisan political agenda in selecting his cases for prosecution. One can only wonder why President Donald Trump reneged on his promise to keep Bharara in the job. Could it be because the Trump organization is headquartered within the district Bharara oversaw? As the questions grow regarding Trump’s business interests and potential conflicts with his presidency, it wouldn’t be surprising if he wanted someone more controllable in that job. Draining the swamp seems to be one more area in which Trump has been willing to put his own interests ahead of those of the public.

He says they cannot answer the question of whether it is a hate crime at this time.” The Muslim American Society of Minnesota is reportedly offering a $10,000 reward for information that leads to the bombers. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is also offering $10,000 for relevant information. “We hope a reward will help law enforcement authorities quickly apprehend the perpetrator of this act of violence targeting an American house of worship,” Amir Malik, CAIR Minnesota’s civil rights director, said in a statement. “If a bias motive is proven, this attack would represent another in a long list of hate incidents targeting Islamic institutions nationwide in recent months.” There has been an uptick in crimes against Muslims and those perceived as Muslims. Last month, CAIR released a report that found a 91 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes for the first half of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. “We came to this country for the same reason everyone else came here—freedom to worship,” mosque member Yasir Abdalrahman told StarTribune. “And that freedom is under threat.

341,341,"The jury in the Kedarie/Kandicee Johnson case found Jorge Sanders-Galvez, 23, guilty of first-degree murder. The Iowa teen, who was assigned male at birth, went by both Kedarie and Kandicee, and identified as gender-fluid and transgender, was found shot to death in an alley in Iowa last year with a plastic bag shoved down their throat and bleach poured on their body in a possible attempt to destroy DNA evidence. Prosecutors said that Johnson went to a local grocery store to use their wireless connection after teaching a class at a youth community center. Johnson, who alternated between boy and girl clothes, was presenting as female, and prosecutors said that Sanders-Galvez saw a high school girl out on her own at night. After they talked, Johnson walked to a nearby friend’s house. The friend testified that Johnson was scared and said they were being followed, and that she saw a red car waiting outside the house. She offered Johnson a ride home, but they said that they would be alright. Prosecutors said that Sanders-Galvez got the teen into the car and took them home to rape them with his cousin Jaron Purham, 25. When they saw the teen’s body, prosecutors said they “suffocated Kedarie by stuffing a rag down [their] throat and wrapping a plastic bag around [their] head, threw [them] in their car, drove to another part of town, dumped [them] in an alley and shot [them] several times until [they] bled to death.” The men then fled the state with the gun in the car. Prosecutors showed that they searched the internet at least 57 times looking for information about the investigation into Johnson’s murder. Several weeks later, they were arrested. It took the jury 90 minutes to reach a guilty verdict. Sanders-Galvez could be sentenced to life in prison. Purham is still awaiting trial. The case attracted national attention again last month when the Department of Justice sent a hate crimes lawyer to assist in the prosecution. Police insisted that the murder was not a hate crime, and Iowa’s hate crimes law only covers sex and sexual orientation, not gender identity. While Sanders-Galvez could face federal hate crimes charges, those are usually only imposed if the state fails to get a conviction. “I’ve said that it was a hate crime since the day this all happened,” Johnson’s mother Katrina said. “I do feel like it’s important that that be said.” This Story Filed Under",1,2,0

Rowe allegedly posted videos of Brochu snoring on Snapchat. A room change request was apparently filed and apparently denied. That’s when Brochu took things into her own hands…and beyond.

After 1½ months of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons [on] her backpack, putting her toothbrush where the sun doesn’t shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye to Jamaican Barbie. Brochu’s use of the term “Jamaican Barbie” is a reference to Rowe being black. Brochu is white. That Instagram post was discovered by a neighbor of Rowe’s and then brought to her attention after she obtained her long-requested room change and began to move her belongings to that new room on October 17. Brochu reported the social media posts to the West Hartford Police Department. On Monday, she posted a 103-minute-long Facebook Live video detailing the allegations of abuse and the apparent harm it caused. That video has since gone viral and been viewed over half a million times as of this writing. Brochu, for her part, was brought up on charges of third-degree criminal mischief and second-degree breach of the peace as well as being barred from setting foot on her former campus or contacting the victim while the case is ongoing. West Hartford police also requested that an intimidation based on bigotry or bias charge–a hate crimes charge–be added to Brochu’s rap sheet.

The man, who is 26-years old, said he was first struck by a fist to the back of his head, then to his jaw. The beating continued until he hit the ground, where he was repeatedly kicked. The individuals used gay slurs while attacking the man, who is gay and said he believes his sexual orientation played a role in the attack, the Register reports. The man says there were at least three attackers. He could identify one as male, one as female. New Haven Police are investigating but have yet to call the assault a hate crime, despite the anti-gay slurs reportedly used. The assailants stole his cell phone, drivers license, social security card, and a credit card. He says at least three people he asked refused to call the police for help, despite him bleeding. Having stole his ID, the attackers have been able to track him down on Facebook, where the assault is continuing. The victim said he believes the alleged attackers have created Facebook accounts to harass him on the social media website. The account has been posting remarks on the Facebook updates and made specific references to the attack, the Register adds. After informing New Haven police, the victim said he was advised to notify Hartford police about the online harassment. He said the Facebook page is treating the attack as a joke.

353,353,"A series of racist messages made against five black Air Force Cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy prompted a call for treating others with dignity and respect in an address from the USAFA Superintendent Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria. (Published Friday, Sept. 29, 2017) You Need to Get Out: US Air Force Academy Responds to Racist Messages Racial slurs posted outside the dorm rooms of five black students at the Air Force Academy were written by one of those students, the school said Tuesday, adding Wednesday that it would not discuss what led the student to allegedly stage the hate crime. The announcement was a jarring turn in an episode that prompted the academys superintendent to warn students that racists were not welcome at the school — a speech that attracted nationwide attention. The student is no longer at the school, the academy said. A spokesman declined to say whether the student withdrew or was expelled, citing privacy laws. The students name wasnt released. The slurs were found in September at a dormitory that houses students attending the academys prep school. The prep school is on the academy grounds but not part of the four-year academy program. It helps promising students meet the academys entrance requirements. 1 Killed as Tornadoes Touch Down in Virginia Remnants of what was once Hurricane Florence are still causing problems along the East Coast. One person was killed and another injured during a tornado in Chesterfield County, VA. (Published Monday, Sept. 17, 2018) In a written statement Tuesday, the academy said, We can confirm that one of the cadet candidates who was allegedly targeted by racist remarks written outside of their dorm room was actually responsible for the act. The individual admitted responsibility and this was validated by the investigation. The statement added, Racism has no place at the academy, in any shape or form. Academy spokesman Meade Warthen said Wednesday he could not discuss what may have motivated the student, citing privacy laws. Academy superintendent Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria gave his stern speech to cadets shortly after the slurs were reported. A video of the speech was posted online and has been viewed thousands of times. If you cant treat someone with dignity and respect, get out, he said. At one point, he insisted that everyone in the audience take out their phones and record him so his message was clearly heard. The slurs appeared in the aftermath of racial violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and amid a debate about NFL players kneeling for the national anthem. We would also be tone deaf not to think about the backdrop of what is going on in our country, Silveria told cadets. Things like Charlottesville, Ferguson, the protests in the NFL. Silveria stood by his speech Tuesday, the Colorado Springs Gazette reported. Regardless of the circumstances under which those words were written, they were written, and that deserved to be addressed, he said in an email to the newspaper. You can never over-emphasize the need for a culture of dignity and respect — and those who dont understand those concepts, arent welcome here. Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said hate-crime hoaxes are often meant to attract or divert attention or they can be a political statement. Many hate-crime hoaxes occur in school settings, Levin said. Dealing With Insurance After Florence Homeowners are being advised to check in with their insurance agencies to jumpstart the rebuilding process after Florence - even if they havent returned yet. (Published Monday, Sept. 17, 2018) I think that schools and universities are perceived as places that are more embracing to victims of such a tragedy (as a hate crime), he said. A place where the culture is to rally around victims of prejudice, such as universities, would be a reason. Hate-crime hoaxes seem to be on the rise, but the number is tiny compared with actual hate crimes, he said. The FBI said 5,850 hate crimes were reported to law enforcement in 2015, an average of 16 a day. Levin estimated that no more than three hoaxes a month occur nationwide. The academy has struggled with sexual misconduct problems several times in recent years, but few racial incidents have been made public.

357,357,"In the early-morning hours of Sept. 24, Bradd Easton left his Lincoln Square house that he shares with husband Jeff Zacharias and their college-aged daughter to walk their dog, like he normally does every morning. That is when he found anti white cuck spray painted on his propertys sidewalk in both black and white colors just below the staircase going to their front door. Their yard sign that states Here we Believe Love is Love, No Human is Illegal, Black Lives Matter, Science is Real, Womens Rights are Human Rights, Water is Life, Kindness is Everything was also spray-painted over; however, the Hate Has No Home Here sign that is affixed to the inside of their glass front door was untouched. Zacharias noted that this happened between midnight when he went to bed and 7 a.m., when Easton left the house with their dog. Easton explained that he took pictures of the vandalism to document it and when he looked around to see if anyone elses home was vandalized he noticed one Black Lives Matter sign on their street was also sprayed over in white. We feel attacked and unsafe in our own home and neighborhood, said Easton. This can happen to anyone in any neighborhood across America, especially in todays political climate. We urge everyone to speak out and fight this hate with love and kindness. The couple has contacted the police and Easton said they are sending a crime-scene technician to their house to gather evidence. They have also contacted their Ald. Patrick OConnors office to alert him about this alleged hate crime. A few blocks away, another familys home was also targeted with vandalism in the early morning hours of Sept. 24. Kat Hindmand (who lives with her wife Jennie Brier and their 8-year-old son) opened the front door at about 8:15 a.m. to retrieve the New York Times from the porch when she saw the sign that is affixed to the outside of their front door (there is also a screen door) that reads Hate Has No Home Here in multiple languages spray-painted over in white. Hindmand said she took a picture to document it and reported the alleged hate crime to the Southern Poverty Law Center and OConnor and their former Alderman Ameya Pawars offices. She also posted the picture and a description of what happened on social media and alerted many of their neighbors, some of whom have decided to get the same sign and post it on their property in a sign of solidarity. It was sad and unsettling to discover that someone vandalized our message of acceptance, said Hindmand. However, people of color are confronted by racist acts, often much worse than this, every day. And, the people who did this were clearly taught that accepting everyone is a threat. How do we address that? In recent months, Lincoln Square residents have seen an uptick in hate speech vandalism, sexual assaults, and armed robberies and burglaries.

Keytar Bear—whos become famous for donning a full bear suit and playing a keytar on the streets of Boston—was allegedly pounced on by a group of teens from New Hampshire last Saturday, according to police. The punks apparently ripped off his big, goofy mask, pummeled him, and yelled racial slurs before taking off with the cash hed made busking. The kids were later charged with assault, battery, and disorderly conduct, and prosecutors are now investigating the incident as a possible hate crime, the Associated Press reports. Not long after the alleged attack, a local fan started a GoFundMe for Keytar Bear, encouraging folks to donate toward a new speaker, as his old one was damaged during the incident. So far, the campaigns raised more than $7,000. We all love you, one fan wrote on the crowdfunding page. In a city thats a little starved for wacky, fun, artsy, public displays, youre much more valuable than you might know. Over the years, Keytar Bear has become a kind of unofficial mascot for Bostons weird side. He usually can be found in bustling hubs across the city—near Harvard, outside Fenway, in front of Faneuil Hall—and no matter the weather (typically shitty), the street performer is always doin his thing.

(Photo: Bob DeChiara, USA TODAY Sports) A West Los Angeles home owned by LeBron James was vandalized Wednesday morning at 6:44 a.m., Los Angeles Police Department officer Norma Eisenman confirmed to USA TODAY Sports. James was not present when the vandalism took place, Eisenman said. A racial slur was painted on the gate of the Brentwood neighborhood estate but has since been covered over by property management, Eisenman said. Police did not provide details on what the racist slur was. The news was first reported by TMZ. The LAPD is investigating the incident as a hate crime and an official police report is expected later Wednesday. Eisenman did not specify if security footage is being used as part of the investigation to identify any suspects for the graffiti. According to public records, James bought the house in 2015 for roughly $20.9 million. It is 9,440 square feet.

364,364,"Despite the court order, Majors was accused of plowing his auto into Haifa Jabara in 2015. Majors conflict with the Jabara family also put him at odds with his late husband, Stephen Schmauss, who came to befriend Jabara and thought of him as an apprentice, teaching him how to use power tools and computer circuitry. But after hearing all of the evidence, the jury felt differently and found Majors guilty of first-degree murder, malicious intimidation or harassment and threatening an act of violence. The jury on Wednesday recommended maximum sentences of life in prison without parole for murder, up to 10 years for possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony, one year for the hate crime, and six months for the violent threats. The Jabara family said they are relieved the jury gave him the worst possible sentence for the death of their loved one. Jabaras parents testified on the second day of Majors murder trial. A jury determined that he walked up to the familys front door in August 2016 and fatally shot Khalid Jabara. We agree that justice was served, Victoria Jabara Williams, Khalid Jabaras sister, told reporters. And because he did the right thing, hes now dead. The defense attorneys admitted Majors killed Jabara, but said he has schizophrenia and didnt understand what he was doing. Koller contended the state cherry-picked communications between Majors and Schmauss in which Majors sounds lucid without giving adequate context, noting that Majors was on medication when those calls took place. We still are under the impression and belief that our client has a severe mental illness, he said. Prosecutors alleged that Majors killed Jabara after bombarding him with racial insults in a feud with Jabaras family that lasted several years. Prosecutors said there is no death penalty in cases like this that have no aggravating factors. Majors only spoke once during the trial, to tell the judge he wouldnt testify. Your human nature is not to want to believe there is evil in this world, Doss said, adding later, Khalid Jabara did nothing to deserve what he received from Stanley Majors. They said Majors was mean to them for years because theyre Lebanese Americans. Authorities said Majors kept driving after he struck her. Officers who stopped him later reported that he was intoxicated. Johnson said any claim of legal insanity is belied by the fact Majors was heard saying, I told you this was going to happen at the time of the shooting.

370,370,"Shoshana and Ari Simones had just returned home with their daughter from a Fourth of July trip when they saw a curious sight: their mailbox, covered with sheets of paper. While Shoshana was inside, putting their baby to bed, Ari pulled the paper off the mailbox, where he found a note from a neighbor. “I am so sorry and disgusted by this,” it read. Ari went inside and informed Shoshana. “It’s a swastika,” he told her. “I just burst into tears; it was just so upsetting,” Shoshana Simones told Phoenix New Times. “I never would’ve imagined that that would be there.” “I couldn’t go outside and look at it that night,” she added. “My husband showed me the photo on his phone.” While they were away for the holiday, their mailbox had been defaced with a swastika and the word Jew, spray-painted in black. A neighbor intervened before the Simones family returned, covering the racist and disturbing graffiti with tape and paper. “We’re not ashamed to be Jews, and we’re not going to let someone try to scare us.” Facebook Twitter More shares recommend reddit email But the next day, the Simoneses removed the paper on the mailbox. Instead of removing or hiding the hateful imagery right away, they left it up, uncovered. “We’re not ashamed to be Jews, and we’re not going to let someone try to scare us,” Shoshana said. On Thursday morning, they awoke to see that someone had spray-painted over the graffiti, covering it with black ink. Shoshana, 29, thinks it might have been “a teenager who was scared or embarrassed,” who returned at night to cover their graffiti after media reports of the hate incident. Regardless, today the Simones family and their neighbors intend to repaint the mailbox. “They’re going to come out and bring paint and supplies,” she said. “We’re going to write positive messages of love and pride.” The incident is a ugly reminder of a national undercurrent of hatred and prejudice. And the graffiti is just the latest in what experts say is a rising trend of hate-based attacks, in Arizona and around the U.S. It seems this is shaping up to be a banner year for hatred. In April, the Anti-Defamation League reported that anti-Semitic incidents in Arizona – including assaults, harassment, and vandalism – have already exceeded the total number that occurred in 2016. And since 2015, the number of anti-Semitic incidents has more than tripled in the state. Recently, Jewish community centers in Scottsdale and Tucson received bomb threats on the same night in February, and an auditorium at Pinnacle High School was defaced with a swastika in March. “This is not a new phenomenon,” said Carlos Galindo-Elvira, the Arizona director for the ADL. “Anti-Semitism is one of the oldest hatreds in the world, he told New Times. It’s never gone away. It may have been under the surface, but it exists.” In the wake of Donald Trump – whose presidential run galvanized racists and trafficked in a toxic brew of white nationalism and xenophobia – it’s hard not to draw conclusions about the upward trend. In the 10 days after Trump’s victory, the Southern Poverty Law Center cataloged almost 900 reports of hate incidents using media reports and submissions to their website. According to the FBIs latest data, there were over 5,850 hate crimes nationwide in 2015. Attacks on Muslims surged by 67 percent, and anti-Semitic attacks were the most common form of religiously motivated hate crimes. And in Phoenix? The city saw a larger-than-average increase – hate crimes rose by 26 percent. Its even more troubling once you consider that these numbers are probably a low estimate: State and local law enforcement aren’t required to report incidents to the FBI, and many incidents go unreported. Since the election, the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica has stepped in. The “Documenting Hate” project is currently chronicling the scope of bias attacks nationwide with witness submissions and media partners. Certainly, in this current environment, it seems to have been made permissible to act in this way toward not just Jews, but toward immigrants, toward Muslims, and toward members of the LGBT community, Galindo-Elvira said. And so hate attracts hate. Hate-based attacks also dont happen in a vacuum. Bias attacks on an ethnic or religious group create a ripple effect of distress for anyone who shares the targeted identity, according to the American Psychological Association. Galindo-Elvira said that oftentimes, the community bears the weight of a hate incident. What we have to understand about hate crimes is it’s a message crime, he told New Times. It’s not just about how it impacts one family, but indeed how it impacts the neighborhood, and the community as a whole.” Sergeant Jonathan Howard, a spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department, said the departments bias crime unit is investigating the vandalism at the Simones residence; there are no updates at this time. The familys courage in the face of an attack on their home has been praised, especially in light of the continuing effort to document the scope of hate incidents. Galindo-Elvira said of the Simoneses, “I really applaud the courage that she and her husband have demonstrated in owning the word, and wanting to educate the community.” For her part, Shoshana said the incredible support from the community has been “a silver lining.” “We’ve had neighbors stopping by – everyone’s been horrified, and wanting to make it clear that this was one ignorant, hateful person,” she said.

In November 2017, Purinton waived his right to a preliminary hearing and pleaded not guilty. In Johnson County District Court on Tuesday, Purinton, 52, reversed that plea and agreed to the maximum sentence for each of three counts: one count of premeditated first degree murder, and two counts of attempted murder in the first degree. Before allowing Purintons plea, Judge Charles Droege explained to Purinton that changing his plea meant he would face life in prison, as well as a minimum of 146 months, maximum of 653 months in prison for attempted murder, not to mention the sentence hell face if convicted of a hate crime in federal court. Purinton told the judge he understood, then he sat down as the State presented the details of the incident last February. As Purinton took a drink of water, his attorney placed a hand on his back and whispered, Are you OK? Purinton nodded. Purintons actions at Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe earned national attention. He approached Kuchibhotla and Madasani, who were sitting on the patio, and asked them, Where are you from? How did you get into this country? He was escorted from the bar but soon returned with a Taurus 9mm handgun. He fired at least eight shots at the two men, hitting Kuchibhotla several times and hitting Madasani in the thigh. When he attempted to flee, Grillot, a bystander, followed him. Purinton then turned around and shot Grillot before driving away. Sentencing is scheduled for May 4. Purinton has also been charged in federal court with a hate crime. Federal authorities allege that Purinton targeted Kuchibhotla and Madasani, both from India, because of their race, ethnicity or national origin. In a filing from February 2, the court gave U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions another 90 days to decide whether to seek the death penalty against Purinton.

377,377,"Post submitted by Troy Stevenson, Executive Director of Freedom Oklahoma Last week, Randy Gamel-Medler, an Oklahoma gay man, filed a federal equal protection lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against nine defendants from Blaine County, Oklahoma, including Mayor of Hitchcock Rick Edsall, Sheriff of Blaine County Tony Almaguer, and Undersheriff of Blaine County David Robertson. The lawsuit also includes state law claims for assault, battery, destruction of real and personal property, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The complaint details months of police and government inaction in response to racist and homophobic threats and harassment. When our family moved to the town of Hitchcock in rural Oklahoma we thought we were buying our last house, we wanted to know our neighbors by their first names and grow old together, but we were soon met with hatred, suspicion, and discrimination,” said plaintiff Randy Gamel-Medler. “We were terrorized, murder threats were made against our seven year-old African-American son. Town officials conspired to run us out of office, all while local law enforcement ignored our pleas for help. We are now left with the last 27 years of our life literally erased. What do we do now? Gamel-Medler, a white gay man with a seven year-old African-American son, was first threatened in September 2016 at a town council meeting only one month after moving to Hitchcock, Oklahoma. Upon learning that Gamel-Medler had an African-American son, defendant Meradith Norris, a town of Hitchcock Trustee, asked, “What’s going to happen when your house burns down and we don’t send out the fire trucks?” In response, Gamel-Medler filed a police report, but no criminal action was taken. We must not forget that after years of progress, crimes of bias still exist. The allegations in Hitchcock are horrific, and show the intersection of hate aimed at the both the African-American and LGBTQ Communities. Freedom Oklahoma stands with all victims of bias, and will work vigilantly to ensure the state of Oklahoma passes Bias-Crime Protections for all Oklahomans, said Freedom Oklahoma Executive Director Troy Stevenson. In early May 2017, Gamel-Medler was performing his duties as town clerk by clearing an obstruction from the road when he was assaulted by defendant Jonita Pauls Jacks, who tried to enter Gamel-Medler’s truck and then after realizing it was locked began shaking the truck, called him a “f***ing queer,” and stated, “I’m going to grab your little boy, rip his n***er head off, and sh** down his throat.” When Gamel-Medler attempted to file a police report after this incident, he was informed that the mayor had already described this incident to the police. The Deputy Sheriff refused to take a report, said that this is just how these folks are, and characterized the incident as free speech. This abhorrent incident underscores the urgent need for our communities and public officials to commit to combatting the epidemic of hate-based violence that continues to plague too many in the LGBTQ community, said Robin Maril, HRCs Associate Legal Director. No family should have to fear for their safety because of who they are or whom they love. LGBTQ people in Oklahoma and around the nation need action. We must demand training to ensure that law enforcement officials have the tools they need to partner with LGBTQ community-members and to swiftly respond to hate crimes with sensitivity. Adoption of mandatory reporting requirements for hate-crime statistics coupled with the passage of statewide LGBTQ-inclusive hate crimes and non-discrimination protections are also essential to ending this violence. Our hearts go out to the Medler family during this incredibly difficult time. Over the next several weeks, the complaint states that one or more of the defendants threw gravel several times at Gamel-Medler’s home, posted a sign outside of the post office stating that “the town clerk is a “f***ing queer,” and attempted to run a friend of Gamel-Medler’s off of the road. “No family should live in fear or have to endure harassment and threats based on racism and homophobia,” said Shannon Price Minter, legal director at LGBTQ national legal organization NCLR. “We must hold those government officials, members of law enforcement, and others accountable.” On May 28, the complaint notes that Gamel-Medler heard the sound of glass breaking in his garage and called the Sheriff’s office to report a burglary. He then saw a fire in his garage and called the fire department. Despite the fire department being located one block away from Gamel-Medler’s home, the fire department failed to arrive until the house had burned to the ground. While the house was burning, a number of the named defendants watched it burn, including Mayor of Hitchcock Rick Edsall, who sat and watched with his family in lawn chairs. The horrific treatment of this man and his child are a terrible reminder of how hatred and bigotry feed off of each other. I hope this lawsuit will bring justice for him and social awareness for everyone, said the attorney on this case, Mark Hammons of Hammons, Gowens, Hurst, & Associates.",1,0,3
378,378,"Linda Coan OKresik | BDN Linda Coan OKresik | BDN The Associated Press • December 24, 2017 1:04 pm AUGUSTA, Maine — Maine’s high court has ordered a lower court to explain why potential jail time for any future hate crimes he might commit would be justified for a Turner man convicted of twice ramming into the car of a man he believed was gay. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court on Tuesday ordered the Androscoggin County Superior Court to provide clear reasoning for issuing the “very broad and permanent injunction” against Ronald Champagne. [Attorney to high court: Lifetime ban on hate crimes is too broad] According to a court order filed in January, authorities say that Turner resident Champagne yelled a gay slur at a man at a boat launch on Lake Auburn in March 2012. He then told the man he would ram his car into the lake before twice driving into the back of the man’s Subaru. Last year, Champagne pleaded no contest to reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon and was sentenced to 18 months in prison with all but 14 days suspended, and a year of probation, the Bangor Daily News previously reported. The attorney general’s office also brought a civil rights case against Champagne under the state’s civil rights act. The office has argued for a court order warning that Champagne could face up to one year in jail if he commits future hate crimes against any group protected under Maine’s hate crimes law. But Champagne’s attorney Donald Hornblower said the court’s order should limit Champagne only from threatening or using violence against individuals because of their sexual orientation. “I pointed out it was overbroad and there was no evidence supporting” the order, Hornblower said. “A lifetime injunction against all these classes, it’s a very severe thing.” In the Tuesday opinion, the Supreme Judicial Court justices said that such a comprehensive ban must be based on factual findings and evidence. “Because the court did not make the required factual findings providing the basis for its injunction, we do not have a sufficient record for appellate review,” the justices said. The justices said without such details, they can’t decide whether the court abuse its discretion. The Maine attorney general’s office didn’t respond to request for comment Friday.

379,379,"A man who earlier this year allegedly shot three people at a Kansas bar — killing a man from India — was indicted Friday on federal hate crime and other charges. Authorities allege Adam W. Purinton, 52, of Olathe, shot Srinivas Kuchibhotla and two other men on February 22. The hate crime charges were filed in connection with the shootings of Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, who survived. Purinton is also accused of shooting Ian Grillot, who tried to stop the suspect. He was also charged with killing Kuchibhotla “through the use of a firearm in such a manner as to constitute murder,” according to the indictment. If convicted of that federal offense, Purinton could be sentenced to life in prison or death. Purinton already faces first-degree murder and attempted murder charges in state court. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for September 18. Purinton was arrested hours after the shooting while he was at an Applebee’s restaurant in Clinton, Missouri, about 70 miles away from Olathe. Purinton reportedly told a bartender who made a 911 call that he had shot two Iranians. Kuchibhotla and Madasani, each 32, both worked at Garmin, a tech company that makes GPS devices. The incident raised worries among Indians and other communities about possible violence against foreign workers in the United States.",1,0,0

The assault was unprovoked and is being investigated as a hate crime, said LAPD spokesman Tony Im. The suspect approached the victim near Argyle and Franklin avenues, stabbed the victim with an unknown object and ran away. The suspect yelled “I hate trannies” as he fled and was last seen heading northbound on Argyle Avenue, Im said. Police and paramedics were called to the scene, however the victim declined treatment. Detectives and officers were deployed throughout the area in an attempt to find the attacker but were unsuccessful. Investigators are asking for the public’s help to identify the attacker. “It’s very serious,” said Lt. Richard Gabaldon, of the LAPD’s Hollywood Division. “We put a lot of resources into this.

386,386,"The Hoboken Police Department in New Jersey said Sunday it was investigating as a possible bias crime flyers that feature a photo of a Sikh mayoral candidate wearing a turban and the message “Don’t let TERRORISM take over our Town!” The leaflets, distributed days before Tuesday’s upcoming election, display a picture of Councilman Ravi Bhalla, who is running for mayor, with the caption about terrorism above his head. The literature goes on to allege “a potential conflict of interest” involving Bhalla and his position on the City Council. Bhalla called the flyers troubling in a statement provided by his campaign to NBC News. “I want to use this incident as an opportunity to affirm to each other and our children the value of living in a diverse community where we are judged by the content of our character — not by the color of our skin or how we worship,” he said. Candidates in the nonpartisan Nov. 7 race are running to replace incumbent Mayor Dawn Zimmer, who is not seeking reelection. Hoboken Police Department Capt. Charles Campbell told NBC News in an email that the incident was being investigated as possible biased harassment. That’s because it may cause alarm or annoyance as described in the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice, he said. “We are in the initial stages of this investigation and we are acquiring evidence and information witnesses,” Campbell said. The upper lefthand corner of the flyer reads “Paid for by Team DeFusco For Hoboken,” referring to Mike DeFusco, a Hoboken city councilman also running for mayor. But DeFusco campaign spokesman Philip Swibinski told NBC News Saturday it was not responsible for the flyer, and in a press conference, DeFusco vehemently denounced the flyer, calling it racist and disgusting. “It’s just sad, it’s awful,” Swibinski said. “For anybody to say that about a person of South Asian descent, like Ravi, is disgusting.” Swibinski said the DeFusco campaign put out a piece of direct mail around three weeks ago that included everything on the flyer except the message about terrorism. He said the campaign thinks the mailer was probably scanned and the message “Don’t let TERRORISM take over our Town!” photoshopped in. Swibinski provided a copy of the original to NBC News, which had a postage-paid stamp where the sentence aimed at Bhalla appeared. “This was really just a disgusting act by somebody, we don’t know who,” Swibinski said. DeFusco’s campaign, which became aware of the flyers on Friday night when someone spotted them, notified the Hoboken Police Department and the Hudson County prosecutor’s office, according to Swibinski. The literature targeting Bhalla comes just days after news of flyers being sent out elsewhere in New Jersey that were directed at two Asian-American school board candidates with the tagline “Make Edison Great Again.” The mailer, sent anonymously to residents of Edison Township, featured photos of candidates Falguni Patel and Jerry Shi with “deport” stamps on their faces and the accusation that residents of Chinese and Indian descent are “taking over” the town.

388,388,"Justin Cole Whittington, 25, was convicted in December of using force to interfere with a person’s housing rights, use of a firearm during a crime of violence and lying to the FBI. He previously pleaded guilty to illegally possessing the sawed-off shotgun. Identified in court documents as a member of the Peckerwood skinhead gang, on Dec. 19, 2012 Whittington fired a sawed-off shotgun at a Latino man—a total stranger—standing in his front yard in Oildale, California north of Bakersfield. “The defendant shouted ‘fucking nigger,’ fired one round toward [the victim] from about fifteen yards away, and yelled ‘get the fuck out of Oildale,’” before driving away, Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian K. Delaney wrote in a sentencing memorandum. The victim “heard pellets fly by his head, and believed for a moment that he had been shot,” the memorandum says, but neither he nor his wife, standing nearby, were hit by the shotgun blast. “As a result of the shooting, the victim’s family was concerned about their safety, and moved from their home shortly thereafter,” the memo says. If that wasn’t enough, Whittington then drove to a nearby convenience store owned by a man of Middle Eastern descent and fired the shotgun again, this time without leaving the vehicle. “The blast left a large hole in the store’s glass door, and circles of missing paint on the metal gate in front of the store,” federal investigators said. The victim of that attack provided Kern County Sheriff’s deputies with a description of the shooter’s car. Deputies quickly located Whittington nearby standing outside the car. They recovered a sawed-off shotgun in the trunk of Whittington’s Crown Victoria, which was parked near the car used in the two shootings, authorities said. “Whittington admitted to law enforcement … that he had been a member of the Oildale Peckerwoods, a white supremacist gang, and has gang tattoos, including a ‘P’ and a ‘W’ on his shins, for the Peckerwoods, and a ‘23’on his stomach symbolizing the 23rd letter of the alphabet—W— for White Power,” the sentencing memo says. Whittington subsequently made false statements to an FBI agent when questioned about the sawed-off shotgun. He was indicted on federal hate crime charges in September 2015. Earlier that year, Whittington was arrested when he was caught on a surveillance camera hitting his 3-year-old son in a Bakersfield convenience store. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor child abuse charge. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Dale A. Drozd of the Eastern District of California sentenced Whittington to 15 years in prison for federal hate crimes—five years less than the sentence recommended by prosecutors. “The sentence handed down today reflects the seriousness of hate crimes such as this, which cause not only the victims but entire communities to feel vulnerable and unsafe,” said U.S. Attorney Phillip A.Talbert. “Our district is one that is rich in diversity, and my office is committed to investigating and prosecuting those who violate community members’ civil rights through acts of hate and intimidation,” Talbert said. At the Justice Department in Washington, D.C., Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler said the case demonstrates that “hate violence has no place in our society.” “It harms individuals and entire communities by threatening their sense of security and freedom,” Wheeler said. “In this case, Whittington fired a shotgun at the victim, terrorizing him and his family, because of his Latino ethnicity. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute hate crimes so that all people, no matter the color of their skin, their country of origin, or how they worship, can live their lives freely and without fear.”",1,0,0
389,389,"A Sikh man said a gunman approached him as he worked on his car in his suburban Seattle driveway and told him to “go back to your own country” before shooting him in the arm, authorities say. Police in the city of Kent are searching for the shooter and have contacted the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. The shooting comes after an Indian man was killed and another wounded in a recent shooting at a Kansas bar that federal agencies are investigating as a hate crime after witnesses say the suspect yelled “get out of my country.” “With recent unrest and concern throughout the nation, this can get people emotionally involved, especially when (the crime) is directed at a person for how they live, how they look,” Kent Police Cmdr. Jarod Kasner told The News Tribune of Tacoma. India’s foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj, identified the victim on Twitter early Sunday, saying, “I am sorry to know about the attack on Deep Rai, a U.S. national of Indian origin.” She said she had spoken to Rai’s father, who told her Rai is out of danger and recovering in a hospital. Rai told police that a man he didn’t know came up to him Friday night and they got into an argument, with the suspect telling Rai to go back to his homeland. He described the shooter as 6 feet tall and white with a stocky build, police said. He said the man was wearing a mask covering the lower half of his face. Sikhs have previously been the target of assaults in the U.S. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the backlash that hit Muslims around the country expanded to include those of the Sikh faith. Male observant Sikhs often cover their heads with turbans, which are considered sacred, and refrain from shaving their beards. The faith comes from South Asia’s Punjab region. In 2012, a man shot and killed six Sikh worshippers and wounded four others at a Sikh temple near Milwaukee before killing himself. The Sikh Coalition, a national civil rights group, asked local and federal authorities to investigate the shooting in suburban Seattle as a hate crime. “We’re early on in our investigation,” Kent Police Chief Ken Thomas told the Seattle Times on Saturday. “We are treating this as a very serious incident.” Hira Singh, a Sikh community leader in Kent, said Sunday that the news was a shock to him. “This kind of incident shakes up the whole community,” he said. He said there have been increasing complaints recently from Sikh community members who say they have been the target of foul language or other comments. About 50,000 Sikhs live in Washington state, with most in the Puget Sound region, he said. “It was disheartening to see it happening here in my community,” Satwinder Kaur said. “Kent is a very diverse community. We haven’t seen a hate crime happening at this level.” Kaur said she had arranged for Kent’s police chief to talk to the community Saturday about their concerns on immigration and the role of local police officers. After the shooting, the meeting turned into a question-and-answer session about the crime, she said. “When someone says ‘Get out of my country,’ it’s a hate crime, there’s no question,” Kaur said. “The community has been shaken up.”",1,0,0

They said the officers refused to chase the men, who were still visible in the distance. And a female officer told Logunov to “stop the drama” and “shut the fuck up.” Paramedics who treated the couple at the scene told them to go home. Later, they decided to go to the hospital on their own and discovered that Chalarca had a broken tear duct and might need surgery. The attack was recorded on video.

Sean Christopher Urbanski, 22, of Severna Park, is accused of killing Richard Collins III in the predawn hours of May 20 at a campus bus stop. Collins attended nearby Bowie State University. Urbanski was a member of a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich,” which spews hatred toward minorities and “especially African-Americans,” police said at the time. Collins “was killed because of his race,” Angela D. Alsobrooks, state’s attorney for Prince George’s County, said declining to release specific details about the evidence that led the grand jury to hand down the indictment on the hate crime resulting in death charge. “There was lots of digital evidence that we could look at to get a sense for the motive in this case,” Alsobrooks said. She added: “It came from his phone, computer ….There was some activity on Facebook.” Collins, 23, been recently commissioned as a second lieutenant, and was three days away from graduating. He was posthumously awarded his degree. Collins and Urbanski did not know each other, officials said. “It is our great hope that we will bring peace and healing to the family in this case,” Alsobrooks said. Bowie State reflecting on ‘precious life lost’ The University of Maryland, in a statement, said the “Collins family remains in our thoughts, following their tragic loss last May.” “This is especially true today as the prosecution of this senseless crime moves through the criminal justice system,” the university said. Bowie State said: “While it is encouraging to see progress being made in the criminal case, we continue to reflect on the precious life lost.” In July, a separate grand jury indicted Urbanski on a common-law murder charge, which covers first-and-second-degree murder. Police said Urbanski yelled bizarre commands at Collins, who was with friends on the Maryland campus, witnesses told police. “Step left, step left if you know what’s best for you,” Urbanski said, according to court papers.

396,396,"New Haven police investigate assault on gay man with possible hate crime elements Assault victim believes his sexual orientation was targeted NEW HAVEN >> The 26-year-old man said the first clenched fist struck the back of his head. The second one struck his jaw. The Hartford resident was on Kensington Street Tuesday when he said he was attacked by at least three individuals, who struck him until he fell to the ground. The victim said the individuals kicked him while he lie on the ground. The entire attack took several minutes, though he said it felt like years. The Register is not using the man’s name at his request. “It felt like 10 years, but it had to be around seven minutes max,” he said. “It happens so fast. I thought I was going to die.” The individuals used gay slurs while attacking the man, who is gay and said he believes his sexual orientation played a role in the attack. He also believes the three attackers may have thought he was a sex worker. “I do feel like my sexual orientation (was) a part of this crime,” he said, adding: “That’s what you think of me? That’s what you think of my people? You think that we all want to be sex workers.” New Haven police spokesman Officer David Hartman confirmed Thursday police are investigating the assault and also are exploring whether the alleged crime has elements of a hate crime. Hartman said the victim told police he was meeting someone contacted through an online dating app near Kensington Street and Chapel Street. The victim described at least two attackers, including one male and one female. The alleged attack came a day before U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal spoke at a press conference in Hartford addressing three recent LGBTQ teen suicides and bullying of LGBTQ youth. The aim is more public opposition to what is seen as an increase in hate incidents against youth based on their sexual orientation and gender identification. Both Blumenthal and Robin P. McHaelen, executive director of True Colors Inc., alleged that President Donald Trump’s rhetoric is promoting negative bias. McHaelen’s organization provides services for LGBTQ youth and their families. McHaelen joined Hartman last week in a discussion about the relationship between the LGBTQ community and law enforcement. The attackers stole the victim’s cellphone, his driver’s license, a credit card and his Social Security card. The victim said he had trouble getting help following the attack, with at least three people refusing to help him by calling police. One even thought he was panhandling, he said. At that point, the victim said he had blood running down his arms, which were scraped. He was still finding new cuts on Thursday while recalling the attack. His head struck the ground during the attack, which prompted a scan at a local hospital hours later that ruled out a concussion. In some ways, the attack hasn’t stopped, he said. The victim said he believes the alleged attackers have created Facebook accounts to harass him on the social media website. The account has been posting remarks on the Facebook updates and made specific references to the attack. After informing New Haven police, the victim said he was advised to notify Hartford police about the online harassment. He said the Facebook page is treating the attack as a joke. “I’m being harassed at home,” the victim said. “This is concerning cyber-bullying.” The victim said the New Haven police officer who assisted him following the attack tried to calm him down. He took down information and asked whether he needed additional medical attention, eventually calling for an ambulance. While they waited, the victim said he sat in the cruiser’s backseat. “I wasn’t happy about it but I felt a little bit safer because I am in this cop car and I knew nothing can happen to me here,” he said.

397,397,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — A White man was indicted Tuesday on a hate crime charge for allegedly stabbing a Black college student to death “because of his race,” a Maryland prosecutor said. Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Angela Alsobrooks announced the grand jury indictment against Sean Urbanski at a news conference in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Richard Collins III was stabbed to death on May 20 at the University of Maryland, days before he was set to graduate from Bowie State University. He had just been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. “We are completely comfortable with the indictment in this case and look forward to taking the case to trial in January,” Alsobrooks said, adding that prosecutors took the time they felt was necessary to investigate all the evidence. Authorities analyzed “lots and lots of digital evidence,” including evidence from Urbanski’s phone and computer data, Alsobrooks said. “There was lots of digital evidence that we could look at to get a sense for the motive in this case,” Alsobrooks said, though she declined to elaborate. “Again, we can’t discuss in detail without compromising our case what the evidence is in the case, but again the evidence led us to the conclusion that Lt. Collins was murdered because of his race,” Alsobrooks added, when reporters asked for further details. Hassan Murphy, an attorney representing the Collins family, commended the decision to bring the hate crime charge. “The Collins family calls on the University of Maryland, the University Police, the State Police, the Attorney General, and the Governor to do what is necessary to protect students of color at its institutions and to make them truly safe for all so that no family has to suffer as they have,” Murphy said in a statement. Collins, 23, was visiting friends at the College Park campus of the University of Maryland when the stabbing happened. Authorities quickly focused on the possibility that the slaying was a hate crime, because Urbanski became a member of a racist Facebook group several months before the stabbing. University of Maryland Police Chief said at the time he asked the FBI to assist in the investigation after learning Urbanski belonged to a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich: Nation,” where members post disparaging material about African-Americans and others. Officials said Collins was with two friends near a campus bus stop about 3 a.m. when they heard Urbanski screaming and watched him approach them. Urbanski said “Step left, step left if you know what’s best for you,” according to the charging documents. Collins said “no” before Urbanski stabbed him once in the chest, the documents said. The killing roiled both campuses, which are near each other in suburban Washington. Bowie State is a historically black school. The case increased racial tensions at the flagship campus of Maryland’s university system, and the university announced new initiatives to improve how it investigates hate-based incidents. “The Collins family remains in our thoughts, following their tragic loss last May,” the University of Maryland said in a statement. “This is especially true today as the prosecution of this senseless crime moves through the criminal justice system.” Urbanski, 22, has been held on a murder charge since the stabbing. The former University of Maryland student faces up to life without parole, plus 20 years for the charge of a hate crime resulting in death, Alsobrooks said. William Brennan, Urbanski’s attorney, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.",1,0,0
398,398,"When a gay man in Columbus, Oh., was threatened by a man using a homophobic slur, police acknowledged his concern that the incident may have been motivated by bias, but they got a key detail wrong in their incident report: They mistakenly marked it as a case of anti-heterosexual harassment, reports ProPublica. Since 2010, Columbus police have reported six incidents that list bias against heterosexuals as the purported motivation. That’s more than any other local law enforcement agency in the nation reported during that period. Columbus Police Department Sgt. Dean Worthington acknowledges it’s likely that the officers who filed the reports marked the wrong box. Those reports made their way from Columbus to the FBI, where they were compiled with thousands of others into the Uniform Crime Report. Every year a small number of anti-heterosexual hate crime reports end up in the UCR. From 2010 to 2016, the FBI reported that local law enforcement agencies noted a total of 142 of them. ProPublica reviewed dozens of these reports, and found few, if any, actual hate crimes targeting people for being heterosexual. ProPublica sent Freedom of Information Act requests to every law enforcement agency that reported a heterosexual bias crime in 2016, and was able to locate records for 58 cases. None described hate crimes spurred by anti-heterosexual bias. As with the case in Columbus, about half were actually anti-gay or anti-bisexual crimes that were miscategorized. Seven cases appeared to reflect other types of bias, with victims targeted because they were Jewish or black or women. Some 18 cases don’t seem to have been hate crimes at all. The findings show that many local law enforcement agencies do a poor job tracking hate crimes. It’s a problem that can leave policy makers blind when grappling with the problem of hate crimes and bias incidents.",1,4,3
402,402,"Rachel Tuszynski (left) and Bolingbrook Mayor Roger Claar Rachel Tuszynski BOLINGBROOK – A Will County judge agreed to block the release of photographs in a case where Bolingbrook Mayor Roger Claar’s home was allegedly vandalized with graffiti of swastikas and anarchist symbols. County prosecutors argued in an Oct. 18 court motion that the release of the photographs would lead to “heightened public condemnation” of Rachel Tuszynski, 30, who was arrested by Bolingbrook police in connection with the case. They also argued the photos’ release would deny Tuszynski of her right to a fair trial. Judge Daniel Kennedy granted the motion with no objection from defense attorneys. In his court order, Kennedy said the Bolingbrook police and county prosecutors are prohibited from releasing the photographs to any party outside the case. The spokesman for the Will County State’s Attorney’s Office, Charles B. Pelkie, said the motion to bar the release of the photos was a reassertion of the office’s obligation to not release discovery material in ongoing criminal cases. “It’s our position in pretty much every case,” Pelkie said. Claar said he did not ask the prosecutors to file the motion but added that he supported it. The Herald-News is appealing the denial of photos’ release by Bolingbrook police to the Illinois Attorney General’s Office. The attorney general’s office took up a review of the village’s response to The Herald-New’s Freedom of Information Act request for the photographs on Oct. 11. On Sept. 20, Tuszynski allegedly spray- painted swastika symbols on Claar’s home and wrote a message for him to resign, and also damaged a speed limit sign and sidewalk, damaged a building in the 400 block of North Bolingbrook Road and stole U.S. and Bolingbrook flags. Tuszynski was arrested shortly after and booked into the Will County jail. Her bond was set at $150,000. Tuszynski remains in custody. She was charged with a hate crime for damaging property “by reason of the actual or perceived creed of” Claar, according to the criminal complaint. When asked about the hate crime charge and Claar’s “creed,” Pelkie has said the charge will “have to speak for itself,” and that it is not the office’s practice to elaborate beyond the charge. The Herald-News filed a FOIA request with the Bolingbrook police on Sept. 25. Partially redacted police reports on Tuszynki’s arrest were released but the photos were withheld. The police department’s’s FOIA officer has said an assistant state’s attorney asked for the photos to be kept under wraps. In an email, the officer said “the Will County State’s Attorney’s Office has determined that due to the inflammatory nature of photographs, the disclosure of the photographs would inhibit their ability to prosecute the case, and would jeopardize the accused’s right to a fair trial.” Pelkie has said Bolingbrook police made the decision to withhold the photos. The state’s attorney’s office provided consultation, Pelkie said, who declined to go into specifics at the time.",1,0,2
403,403,"The brutal murder of a 17-year-old Muslim girl that has rocked the country and had sparked cries for justice on social media is being investigated as road rage and not as a hate crime, Fairfax County police said Monday. Darwin A. Martinez Torres, a 22-year-old resident of Sterling, VA, was charged on Monday with assaulting and ultimately killing Nabra Hassanen with a baseball bat as she walked with friends near the All Dulles Area Muslim Society Center early Sunday after overnight Ramadan prayers. Hassanen was one of several teenagers returning to the mosque in Sterling in the early hours of Monday morning after grabbing a bite to eat at a nearby restaurant, according to investigators. Martinez Torres drove past the group of as many as 15 teenagers ― some were walking, some were riding bicycles ― and got into an argument with a boy riding a bike in the roadway. As the altercation escalated, police said, Torrez drove onto the curb, scattering the teenagers, and followed them to a nearby parking lot. Police said the driver got out of his car with a baseball bat, chased Hassanen on foot and hit her with the bat. He took her in his car “to a second location” in nearby Loudon County, police said. Hassanen’s body was later found in a pond. Medical examiners said the teen died of blunt force trauma to her head and neck. Amid widespread speculation that the killing was a hate crime, including from the girls’ parents and many on social media, police said there was no indication of racial slurs or any reference to the teens’ religion during the attack. “No evidence has been recovered that shows this was a hate crime,” Fairfax County Police spokeswoman Julie Parker said during a news conference Monday evening. However, the investigation is ongoing, and police would not rule out that the crime was racially or religiously motivated. Police released few details on Martinez Torres. He is a citizen and national of El Salvador, according to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson. The agency has lodged a detainer request with local police. (ICE lodges detainers when it has probable cause that someone arrested on criminal charges “is removable from the United States.”) ICE has had no “prior encounters” with Martinez Torres, the spokesperson said, declining to provide details on his immigration history due to privacy regulations. Under Virginia law, a hate crime is defined as a criminal act intended to intimidate, harass or instill fear in an individual due to their religion, race or ethnic origin. Hassanen’s killing comes amid rising Islamaphobia, especially against Muslim women. Just last month, two men in Portland, Oregon, were stabbed to death and a third was injured after they tried to stop their assailant from harassing two young women who appeared to be Muslim. Across the country, hate crimes against Muslims are on the rise. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a leading Muslim civil rights and advocacy group, urged police to “conduct a thorough investigation” into the Virginia killing. “As we grieve for Nabra’s loss, we also urge law enforcement authorities to conduct a thorough investigation of a possible bias motive in this case, coming as it does at a time of rising Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate attacks nationwide,” the group’s national executive director, Nihad Awad, said in a statement prior to the police news conference. Hassanen’s parents, meanwhile, have said they believe their daughter’s religion was a factor.",1,3,0
404,404,"Charlottesville driver Alex Fields Jr. faces hate crime charges one year after rally Federal hate crime charges were filed Wednesday against a man accused of plowing a car into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman and injuring dozens more. The Department of Justice announced that an indictment returned Wednesday charges 21-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. of Maumee, Ohio, with 30 crimes, including one count of a hate crime resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, and 28 other hate crimes involving an attempt to kill other people who were injured. “Last summer’s violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “Today’s indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation.” Marcus Martin, who was hit by Field’s car while pushing his wife out of the way and is a friend of Heyer, told NBC News that Field’s deserves the charges. “Lives got taken that can never be brought back. He has to deal with the life consequences and everything he did behind what he did,” Martin said. He also said the charges do not having meaning unless Field’s is put behind bars. “They’re just doing what had to be done. They didn’t charge him because they wanted to, they charged him because they had to,” he said. “By making an example of this kid, it doesn’t bring Heather back.” Authorities have said that Fields, described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the “Unite the Right” rally that drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a Confederate monument. The attack came after the rally had descended into chaos — with violent brawling between attendees and counterdemonstrators — and authorities had forced the crowd to disband. Fields had been photographed hours beforehand with a shield bearing the emblem of Vanguard America, one of the hate groups that took part, although the group denied any association with him. Fields already faces state charges including first-degree murder. He has been in custody since the rally.",1,0,0
407,407,"VICTORIA, Texas – A federal jury in Victoria has returned guilty verdicts on all counts as charged related to the 2017 burning of the local mosque. U.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick made the announcement along with Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, Special Agent in Charge Fred Milanowski of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Special Agent in Charge Perrye K. Turner of the FBI and various state and local law enforcement agencies. “This case represents the great coordination and cooperation of many federal, state and local law enforcement agencies,” said Patrick. “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the religious liberty of all people and their ability to practice their faith without being the target of this kind of dangerous activity.” “All people are entitled to live free from violence and fear, regardless of their religion or place of worship,” said Gore. “Perez’s actions were criminal, unlawful and dangerous. This Justice Department is committed to holding hate crimes perpetrators accountable under the law.” The jury found Marq Vincent Perez, 26, of Victoria, was responsible for a hate crime in the burning of the Victoria Islamic Center Jan. 28, 2017, and for use of a fire to commit a felony. In addition, they found he possessed an unregistered destructive device for an incident that occurred on Jan. 15, 2017. “Houses of worship are scared places in America,” said Milanowski. “We are pleased in the outcome of this investigation, and ATF will continue to aggressively investigate all House of worship fires.” “Hate crimes are not only an attack on a specific victim, they threaten the cornerstone of diversity that America was built upon,” said Turner. “Perpetrators of hate crimes, like Perez, aim to chip away at our nation’s foundations by instilling fear into entire communities with violence.” In his opening statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) Sharad S. Khandelwal outlined the case against Perez, his hatred for Muslims and what transpired on several occasions in January 2018, leading up to the fire. “This is a simple, straightforward case of hate,” he said. The jury heard from a total of 19 government witnesses, to include law enforcement officers, experts and others who testified about communications with Perez, one of whom detailed how Perez called Muslims “towelheads.” An FBI agent took the stand and described hate-filled messages found on Perez’s Facebook account. Testimony in court detailed how Perez had planned the event and talked about how he had done “recon” of the mosque in the days leading up to the fire. A witness who was with Perez on the night of the fire described how excited Perez was upon seeing the mosque in flames, explaining that he was “jumping up and down like a little kid.” Additional evidence also revealed that items taken during two burglaries at the mosque were found at his home as was an improvised bomb similar to what was used in an attempted car-bombing approximately two weeks prior to the fire. The jury also heard from an arson expert who concluded the fire was the result of an “intentional application of an open flame.” The defense attempted to shift the blame to a juvenile cooperator and tried to challenge the validity of the evidence and expert testimony. He also tried to establish an alibi. The jury was not convinced of any of the claims and found him guilty on all counts as charged following the five-day trial and approximately three hours of deliberation. Perez faces up to 20 years in federal prison for the hate crime and up to 10 years for possessing an unregistered destructive device. For use of a fire to commit a felony, the penalty is a consecutive and mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison. All of the counts also carry a potential $250,000 fine. Sentencing has been set for Oct. 2, 2018. He has been and will remain in custody pending that hearing. ATF and FBI conducted the investigation along with the City of Victoria Fire Marshal’s Office, Victoria Fire Department, Victoria Police Department, Texas Department of Public Safety – Criminal Investigations Division and Texas Rangers with assistance of Texas State Fire Marshal’s Office and sheriff’s offices in Victoria and Nueces Counties.

414,414,"Kim Corona kicorona@ursinus.edu On Dec. 14, during final weeks of the Fall 2017 semester, a student wrote a racial slur in the snow on campus. Debbie Nolan, the Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students, sent out an email later that day to notify students and faculty about the incident. Although I was enraged when I found out, I wasn’t surprised. This incident is just one of many on this campus, though they may not all be officially reported. Many students of color have been verbally attacked by white peers. As a Mexican female, I’m frightened not only for my own safety but for the safety of every other minority student on campus. My experience at Ursinus for the past year and a half has taught me that racism and ignorance occur every day and often go unnoticed by the administration. However, the incident itself was not the worst part. In the email Nolan sent out, she titled the subject as “bias incident.” According to Georgetown University, a bias incident is an act that is motivated by racism and other forms of prejudice. This includes, but isn’t limited to religion, ethnicity, gender and more. It is different from a hate crime because it doesn’t involve criminal activity. However, the fact that the incident did not physically harm someone does not erase the harm the assailant committed against minority students on campus through fear. The act was a form of hate speech that was motivated by racism. The administration should reconsider the rhetoric used to identify the incident as hate speech rather than a bias. When incidents of racism occur on campus, justice is never served. Yes, the assailant came forward and received “disciplinary sanctions.” But because these sanctions are confidential, we have no way of knowing what the typical punishment would be. Nevertheless, the disciplinary sanctions do not fully resolve the situation, but only continue to cause speculation surrounding the identity of the student and the administration’s disciplinary process. The end of Nolan’s email stated, “It is an essential value of Ursinus that all should feel welcome, included and safe on our campus.” Personally, it makes it difficult to believe the administration’s statements about inclusivity and safe spaces for all students when I often feel like the way they handle these situations indicates that they don’t care about students of minority races, genders, and sexual orientations. The use of racial slurs and other incidents like this don’t just occur on campus but everywhere in society. These issues have always existed and if you refuse to believe it, you’re a part of the problem. When these incidents occur, I feel like I’m constantly reiterating the same arguments that say derogatory terms are never acceptable to say, that racism continues to be prevalent within society, that class systems exist, and that there’s no such thing as “reverse racism.” However, individuals continue to stay ignorant, ignoring these arguments made by marginalized groups who suffer from these problems. As a Mexican woman, I have become frustrated that certain individuals don’t understand the concept of respecting basic human rights, but then I’m reminded that this country was founded on racism. I hope the administration changes the ways in which they handle incidents involving racism. If the administration strives to truly be an inclusive campus that is safe for everyone, they should stand by that belief and fight for students who are targeted. I understand that this incident had to be dealt with confidentially; however, the administration should seek ways to better prioritize the victims and all marginalized groups. This includes providing protection by having campus safety escort students on campus if they’re scared. The school could also hold town hall discussions where students could provide their own points of view about how these issues should be handled between students and administration. The most important thing the administration can do is to listen to the student body, specifically minority students. Appropriate punishable consequences should be meted out to those who commit these crimes, and the administration should be transparent about this disciplinary process. The lives that have been targeted deserve to be protected and it starts with the school taking full responsibility for their poor actions.",1,0,3

James Alex Fields Jr., 21, plowed into a crowd of people demonstrating against the Unite the Right rally, injuring dozens and killing one woman, Heather Heyer. Fields was indicted on Wednesday by a federal grand jury in Virginia and charged with one count of a hate crime resulting in Heyers death and 28 other hate crimes involving an attempt to kill others who were injured. He was also charged with one count of racially motivated violent interference with a federally protected activity. Fields is already facing state charges including first-degree murder. He has been in custody since the rally. Last summers violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement, via NBC News. Todays indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation. Fields attacked the crowd after authorities forced those assembled to disband, as the rally had led to fighting between its attendees and counterdemonstrators. The indictment said that Fields allegedly accelerated his car into a racially and ethnically diverse crowd of people who had been protesting racism and discrimination. Hours before the attack, Fields was photographed with a shield bearing the emblem of Vanguard America, one of the hate groups that took part in the rally. The group denied any association with Fields. U.S. Attorney Thomas Cullen said that the death penalty review is underway, with the Attorney General having the final say on the matter. Were hopeful that in indicting Mr. Fields today were sending a strong message that racially motivated hate crimes and violent acts will not be tolerated in this district, Cullen said, via NBC 29. I think this community from a law enforcement perspective is well prepared to deal with that. Heyer’s mother, Susan Bro, said that she is unsure whether she wants Fields to receive the death penalty and is grateful that she is not the one making that decision. Bro added that she is glad the attack was classified as a hate crime and hopes that will help the other victims move past the tragedy. “I think a lot of them really need some justice and some vindication for what they were doing, and to acknowledge that a hate crime occurred acknowledges their pain, acknowledges what they’ve suffered,” she said.

420,420,"About 60 per cent of Americans admitted that they knew nothing about the community, according to National Sikh Campaign. A 39-year-old Sikh was shot at earlier this year by a partially masked gunman, who asked him to “go back to your own country” in Kent, Washington. In April, a Sikh cab driver was assaulted and his turban was taken off by four drunken passengers in an incident that is believed to be a hate crime incident. Incidents of hate crimes and racism are nothing new for the Sikh community in the United States, which first faced the issue after 9/11. Since then, Sikh-Americans have seen an increase in hate crimes against them because their long beards and turbans make them more visible than other minority groups, and also makes them prone to being recognised as Muslim hardliners. Sikh-American activists have raised their voice against the intolerant climate spreading in the US. One such non-profit organisation, National Sikh Campaign (NSC), launched a nationwide million-dollar campaign called ‘We are Sikhs’ in April to spread awareness about the minority community. Four months later, the group is still going strong to spread the message about their faith. The organisers believe that it’s the unawareness about Sikhs in America that is dangerous. They want to tell Americans what turban or the kirpan stands for, and bring them closer to understanding the Sikh faith. Over 65 per cent of Americans are ignorant about Sikhism and they aim to use this initiative to spread awareness about the religion and Sikh-Americans, according to the NSC. Rajwant Singh, the co-founder and senior advisor of the National Sikh Campaign, said that the initiative is a “national effort to help inform our fellow Americans about who we are and why we are proud to wear the turban, a symbol of our community’s commitment to equality and serving others,” PTI had reported. Using marketing, public relations and social media, the campaign aims to highlight the Sikh-American community’s increasing presence in national and local news outlets, online platforms and neighbourhoods. “Sikh-Americans are pillars of their communities in every corner of our nation and we must work to proactively meet and connect with our neighbours,” Singh said. There exists a “collective misunderstanding” of what the turban means in the US, because of which the community has been the target of discrimination and hate crimes, especially since the 9/11 terror attacks, the organisation said. “Sikh values are American values, and Sikh-Americans have been making positive and significant contributions to American life for more than a century. We run local businesses and sing our national anthem with pride,” Gurwin Singh Ahuja, the co- founder and executive director of the NSC, said. The American dream is a fundamental part of the Sikh community’s identity in America and they “deeply in the freedom to pursue one’s own success through hard work,” Ahuja added. “We have brought a very scientific and targeted messaging element to the campaign. Our focus is to build a proactive and positive message and try to educate and inform Americans about the positive contributions the Sikhs have been making in America,” Singh said. With this massive campaign, NSC hopes to create awareness about the Sikh faith and promote inclusivity and positive attitude towards the minority community in US.",1,0,0

PORTLAND, Ore. – Two days after a homophobic rant directed at a couple in Southeast Portland, police officials released a statement on how an officer handled the situation. Portland Police said they are investigating the incident that took place Sunday afternoon as a bias threat. One of the women involved recorded the hateful interaction, and it has been widely shared on Facebook. The married couple targeted by the mans vitriol say a Portland Police officer saw the confrontation and stopped, but didnt immediately take a report about what happened. “I was like you need to, you need to do something - hes harassing us.’ And he told us just ignore them and walk away.’ And I was like no, this is hate crime and you need to take care of this right now,’” Tru Dragoon recalled. The officer told everyone involved to separate, which they did. “Just because of hateful speech, an officer cannot necessarily take somebody into custody,” Portland Police Sergeant Chris Burley tells KATU News, describing the legal complexities of these types of cases. Officials said that the video “does not necessarily convey everything that was occurring at the time,” it will be submitted as part of a police report. The Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office will review the report, along with witness interviews, as detectives work to find out whether or not a bias crime took place. More from Portland Police Bureau: Under Oregon law, bias crimes are defined as any criminal act that targets a victim based on the suspects perception of the victims race, color, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or national origin. Detectives work to determine whether or not bias elements are present during the reported crime that align with Oregon law as defined in the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS): The Oregon Revised Statute for Harassment, ORS 166.065, can also be considered. However, in 2008 in State v. Johnson, the Oregon Supreme Court determined ORS 166.065(1)(a)(B) violates Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution. “The Police Bureau is aware that speech, such as the speech present in this video, instills fear in members of our community.

Fresno police have reached out to the public in an effort to help identify the suspects. “It’s an assault that can also be investigated as a hate crime based upon sexual orientation as a substantial motivating factor,” spokesman Mark Hudson told the Fresno Bee. “Once we are able to obviously speak to a person who’s willing to talk to us, who committed the crime, then we’ll have more evidence to try and move a case forward. We’re asking for students’ help in identifying who assaulted her.” Fresno Unified school officials is investigating the alleged attack, but claimed that there were no witnesses to the incident. The school district added that there are no security cameras in the area where the attack occurred. “This incident is clearly disturbing and does not honor the standard we expect all our students to adhere to at Fresno Unified,” spokeswoman Jessica Baird said in a statement. “Principal Castillo is reinforcing the high standards our students are expected to follow, ensuring Bullard High continues to be a safe campus for all students.”",1,4,0

430,430,"Prosecutors say they do not have enough evidence to charge a Severna Park man with a hate crime in the death of a black Army lieutenant at the University of Maryland last spring. Sean Urbanski, 22, was indicted Thursday on a count of common law murder in the death of 2nd Lt. Richard Wilbur Collins III, 23, said Angela Alsobrooks, Prince Georges County states attorney. The charge covers both first- and second-degree murder. While Alsobrooks said there is insufficient evidence that Collins was killed because of his race, her office will continue to investigate the motive. Hate crime charges may come later. After we have reviewed all the devices in the case we will look at the statute to determine whether or not the facts as we find them meet the hate crime elements, and so far, based on what we have, we have to continue to investigate. We didnt have enough today, she said. Alsobrooks plans to pursue a life without parole sentence for Urbanski. William C. Brennan Jr., the attorney for Urbanski, was not immediately available for comment. Urbanski is being held without bond.

Richard Wilbur Collins III, 23, at a press conference in Upper Marlboro. (Joshua McKerrow) (Joshua McKerrow) The University of Maryland student, a 2012 Severna Park High graduate, was charged with first- and second-degree murder after the May 20 attack at a bus stop on the College Park campus. Police said after his arrest that the FBI was investigating the possibility of hate-bias as a motive, sparked by Urbanskis connections to a Facebook group called Alt-Reich, which posted language and viewpoints police described as racist. Collins, a Bowie State University student, was visiting friends on campus when he encountered Urbanski on May 20. Urbanski allegedly stabbed Collins after demanding that he step left, step left if you know whats good for you. Collins and his friends looked at Urbanski, puzzled, police said, and Collins told him no. Urbanski then allegedly stabbed Collins in his chest, police said. Grand jurors received information about video of the attack, Assistant States Attorney Joseph Ruddy said. There is video evidence that captures the entire incident that occurred and the stabbing of Lt. Collins, he said. Prosecutors continue to work with the FBI, which is examining digital devices used by Urbanski. Nothing similar to the Alt-Reich group has been discovered, Alsobrooks said. Now that we have, to some extent, concluded the aspect of our investigation regarding the murder we are continuing to investigate regarding the motive involved in this crime, she said. Collins, of Calvert County, was scheduled to graduate with a degree in business from Bowie State University in May, and was commissioned in the Army just weeks earlier. He was a member of the Bowie State ROTC program. Alsobrooks extended condolences to his family during a news conference in Upper Marlboro called to discuss the grand jury indictment.

The man was eventually charged with assault “I am appalled, shocked & disturbed by the officer’s behavior,” Puerto Rico’s governor tweeted The man seen in a viral video verbally attacking a woman for wearing a Puerto Rico shirt was charged Thursday with a felony hate crime. Timothy Trybus was original charged with misdemeanor assault and misdemeanour disorderly conduct. Those charges were upgraded to two counts of felony hate crime after the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office reviewed the case. Trybus was re-arrested Thursday and is scheduled to appear in bond court Friday. The Cook County Forest Preserve officer seen standing by while Trybus berates the woman in the video has resigned, officials said Wednesday evening. The Cook County Forest Preserve police officer is under investigation after video appeared to show him ignoring a woman’s pleas for help as a man berated her for wearing a Puerto Rico shirt last month during a birthday party at an area park, according to the Forest Preserves. The man seen in viral video of the encounter has been charged with assault, authorities said. Cop Resigns, Man Charged in Racially-Charged Tirade Hate crime charges have been filed against a man who screamed racist taunts at a woman wearing a Puerto Rico shirt. NBC 5s Mary Ann Ahern reports. (Published Thursday, July 12, 2018) Effective today, Officer Patrick Connor no longer serves in the police department of the Forest Preserves of Cook County, the forest preserve tweeted. He resigned late today. But that isn’t where our work ends. Cook County Commissioner Jesus Chuy Garcia released a statement shortly after the announcement calling the officers resignation a commonsense decision. He called for more oversight in the training of forest preserve officers. I am committed to exploring how Cook County can better address racial and social equity to ensure that all people in Cook County can feel safe and welcomed while receiving our services and utilizing our grounds and facilities, the statement reads. I will be closely monitoring the developments of the ongoing investigation and will work to guarantee that potential hate crimes in Cook County are fully prosecuted. Mia Irizarry filmed the scene at the Caldwell Woods forest preserve on Facebook Live as the man, identified by police as Timothy Trybus, began telling her her shirt with the Puerto Rican flag on it should not be worn “in the United States of America.” The video shows the woman asking a nearby Forest Preserves officer for help, but the officer does not appear to stop the man, who continues his rant and gets increasingly closer to Irizarry in the space she said she had rented that afternoon. “Officer, I feel highly uncomfortable; can you please grab him?” she is heard saying on the footage. Man Berates Woman for Wearing Puerto Rico Shirt; Officer Does Nothing to Help A womans video of a man berating her shirt choice in Cook County Forest Preserve has gone viral after an officer in the video does nothing to help. (Published Tuesday, July 10, 2018) The officer then turns around and walks back toward his car. “Why is she wearing that sh--?” the man shouts. Trybus questions if Irizarry is a citizen of the U.S. and continues to shout at her as she pleads with the officer to remove the man from the space, footage shows. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and residents on the island are American citizens. Eventually, other park guests arrive at the scene and get involved. The officer then says something to Trybus, who continues to argue with those at the park as the officer stands by him. Other officers arrive several minutes later and one eventually takes down Irizarry’s information and her account of what happened. Trybus, who authorities said was intoxicated, was arrested and charged with assault and disorderly conduct, the forest preserve said. Though the footage had already been seen over a million times after it was first posted in early June, new postings of the video have prompted responses from the forest preserve and even the governor of Puerto Rico. “We are aware of the the [sic] June 14 incident and video,” the Forest Preserves tweeted Monday. “After the incident, we immediately launched an investigation pursuant to our personnel policies into the response of our officer.” Forest Preserves officials said the officer involved in the incident has been with the department for 10 years, and did call for assistance on his radio. Still, they stated the officers actions were not part of procedure. The officer should have stepped in and he should have done something, Forest Preserves Chief of Police Kelvin Pope said during a news conference Tuesday afternoon. And thats the reason we’re here today, because he did not. Officials said an investigation remained ongoing as of Tuesday and the officer involved was assigned to desk duty pending the outcome. They noted that they apologized to Irizarry and refunded her money. “All people are welcome in the Forest Preserves of Cook County and no one should feel unsafe while visiting our preserves,” their tweet read.

He failed to deescalate the situation and therefore did not ensure a citizen’s safety.” He also called on Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle to “take matter [sic] into her hands.” “The United States of America is a nation that was built and thrives on diversity,” he wrote. “We cannot allow those who do not understand America’s greatness to terrorize people because of their background. This is not the America we all believe in.” Preckwinkle said she apologizes to the woman, calling the man in the footage abusive and offensive.

The video prompted responses from numerous area officials. Rep. Luis Gutierrez took to Twitter after the footage made headlines, calling for a need to stand up to bigotry & bullies. Theres a culture of bigotry & hate thats been condoned in US, which now feels unleashed to express itself in the most ugly & aggressive ways, he wrote. In this case, a US citizen questions the citizenship of another US citizen and American law-enforcement just sits back and watches. I don’t care that she is Puerto Rican or wearing a Puerto Rican flag t-shirt just because Im Puerto Rican. We all should care because we are decent human beings & need to stand up to bigotry & bullies... In a press conference Tuesday afternoon, Cook County Commissioner Luis Arroyo called for the officer to be fired. I have full faith in our system, in the process and the investigation that is underway.

Diaz, age 16 Fulton Police say the group is accused of getting into a physical fight with a victim on May 27. Police say it happened just after the Memorial Day fireworks in the victims front yard. He politely asked them to leave his yard - at that time these five suspects approached him, assaulted him, said Sgt. Stephen Lunn of the Fulton Police Department. During the course of the assault they were using racial slurs towards the victim which elevated it to a hate crime. The victim was repeatedly kicked, punched and struck with a board, according to authorities. Court documents indicate the suspects called the victim the n-word multiple times. The victim is recovering from the assault, but he and his family are still on edge. The victims wife tells CNYCentral the family has had trouble sleeping because of the trauma they experienced that night. The family has a friends dog staying with them for extra protection, and she says she doesnt feel safe letting her kids play unsupervised anymore. The family has even considered moving because of the assault, she says. Pretty rare that you see an unproved attack like we see here, said Sgt. Lunn.

An email alerting faculty and students to the incident called it a “hate crime.” This incident is a hate crime. Avila takes incidents like this very seriously and the incident is being investigated, the email read. A school spokesman told KCUR Tuesday that Avila had not contacted outside law enforcement about the incident. The university emailed statement asked students, faculty, and staff to report any information they may have about the incident to campus security. Federal law says a hate crime occurs when a person uses, or threatens to use, force to willfully interfere with any person because of race, color, religion, or national origin. The classification of a crime as a hate crime can enhance penalties for those found guilty. Avila President Dr. Ron Slepitza is quoted in the email. He writes, “Hate, bigotry, and racism have no place on the Avila campus. Acts like this are unacceptable.” Dallavis Hall, according to the schools website, houses classrooms and studios for Avilas arts and communications departments, among other things. Two years ago, a swastika was drawn in feces in a residence hall at the University of Missouri in Columbia.

439,439,"BATON ROUGE, La. — Police believe the slayings of two black men in Baton Rouge were likely racially motivated and said Sunday they have a suspect — a 23-year-old white man — in custody. The suspect, Kenneth Gleason, was being held on drug charges. Authorities do not yet have enough evidence to charge him with murder, Baton Rouge Sgt. L’Jean McKneely told The Associated Press. McNeely said shell casings from the shootings linked the two slayings and a car belonging to Gleason fit the description of the vehicle police were looking for. He said police had collected other circumstantial evidence but he wouldn’t say what it was. “There is a strong possibility that it could be racially motivated,” he said. The shootings happened about 5 miles from each other. The first occurred Tuesday when 59-year-old Bruce Cofield, who was homeless, was shot to death. The second happened Thursday when 49-year-old Donald Smart was gunned down walking to work at a cafe popular with LSU students, McKneely said. It wasn’t immediately clear if Gleason had an attorney or when his first court appearance would be. Detectives searched Gleason’s home on Saturday and found less than a gram of marijuana and vials of human growth hormone in his bedroom, according a police document. After Gleason was read his Miranda rights, he claimed ownership of the drugs, the document said. ___ Associated Press writer Jacob Jordan in Atlanta contributed to this report.",1,0,0

Groundhogs arent the only ones emerging from burrows, apparently. Racists like a Seattle woman harassing a group of friends made an appearance, as well. A Raw Story report stated that Aditya Asastry and two friends decided to go on a pizza run when a cantankerous woman approached them and went off on a racist tirade. The woman can be heard near the end of the video using the n-word and trying to specify the pronunciation of n***er versus n***a. My friend, whos American but of Puerto Rican descent, was the first one she targeted. And myself and my other friend kind of distanced ourselves, like, hey lets not do this tonight. And she followed us down and continued to escalate things and became more and more agitated and she started calling me things like terrorist, Asastry told Q13 Fox. Asastry pulled out his cell phone camera to document the hate, but the woman later slapped the phone from his hand, breaking it. The woman can be seen on video saying the following: Where are you from? Youre not white, b***h. Where are you from?! You aint white enough b***h. Where are you f***ing from b***h, India? Oh, Im sorry the terrorist country. Im sorry. So try having more respect than your f***ing terrorist f***ing a**. Ill have you arrested so f***ing quick. I have my papers on me b***h. Do you want a f***ing response out of me motherf***er with your what are you f***ing Saudi n***a? I didnt say n***er I said n***a. When I went home it was much more painful to kind of process the things that were being said. The things about get out of my country and the more divisive rhetoric that was said was really what gets to me, Asastry said. Asastry called local police to the scene, and they are currently investigating the alleged assault that was recorded on video. Shortly before this occurred, a black man in Seattle was attacked with a baseball bat for hanging out with a white woman. Hes currently fighting for his life after suffering a traumatic brain injury. I think the content is very important because you see these things and you think that happens somewhere else. And Ive said it to myself many times, however, thats not the case. This happens everywhere, Asastry said. Despite escalating hate crimes in the United States, justice remains lacking. White suspects like this woman would normally get a slap on the wrist instead of undergoing appropriate punishment. In President Donald Trumps America, where the leader of the free world spouts racist rhetoric on a regular basis, bigotry is becoming the norm in public encounters, and divisiveness and hatred is rampant.

449,449,"The man accused of killing a woman when he rammed a car into a crowd of people protesting against a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, now faces federal hate crime charges. The Department of Justice announced that an indictment returned on Wednesday charges James Alex Fields Jr, 21, of Maumee, Ohio, with 30 crimes, including one count of a hate crime resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, and 28 other hate crimes involving an attempt to kill the dozens of other people who were injured. Another charge accuses him of racially motivated violent interference. Last summers violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. Todays indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation. Authorities have said Fields, described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the Unite the Right political rally on August 12 that drew hundreds of white supremacists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a Confederate monument. Fields, who has been in custody since the rally, already faces state charges including first-degree murder and is set to face a jury trial later this year. {articleGUID} The car attack came after the rally had descended into chaos - with violent brawling between attendees and counterdemonstrators - and authorities had forced the crowd to disband. The eight-page indictment alleges Fields decided to attend the rally on or before August 8. As he prepared to leave to travel to Charlottesville, a family member sent him a text message urging him to be careful, the indictment said. Fields replied, Were not the ones who need to be careful, and attached an image of Adolf Hitler, according to the indictment, which also says Fields used social media to promote racist views. Fields then attended the rally on August 12, engaging in chants promoting white supremacist and other racist and anti-Semitic views, the indictment said. After authorities forced the crowd to disband, Fields drove his car towards the area where a racially and ethnically diverse crowd had gathered to protest, the indictment said. Fields rapidly accelerated, through a stop sign and across a raised pedestrian mall, and drove directly into the crowd, it went on to say. In a statement, FBI Special Agent in Charge Adam S Lee of the Richmond Division thanked the business owners and Charlottesville residents who he said had worked with us and provided a massive volume of evidence in this case.",1,0,0
450,450,"The former University of Hartford student accused of harassing her Black roommate by smearing used tampons over her belongings avoided a hate crime charge on Monday. Brianna Brochu, 18, who is white, appeared in Hartford Superior Court but did not comment as she left the courthouse. She pleaded not guilty to the charges of criminal mischief and breach of peace. Civil rights advocates called for Brochu to face hate crimes charges in addition to the other charges. However, the court decided not to pursue those additional charges, drawing condemnation from activist groups. “She should be charged with a hate crime,” NAACP Greater Hartford Branch President Imam Abdul-Shahid Muhammad Ansari told NBC News. “We made our feelings known and will continue to do so, letting the community know and elected officials know as well.” ‘Jamaican Barbie’ Brochu allegedly called her Black roommate Chennel “Jazzy” Rowe “Jamaican Barbie” and embarked on a long-running campaign to get rid of her roommate by a series of disgusting behaviors, including putting Rowe’s toothbrush up her rectum. Rowe said in a Facebook video that she and her roommate had a rocky relationship. For example, Brochu would come in and turn off the lights if Rowe was working. However, it wasn’t until she started “getting sick” that things came to a head. “It started with throat pain,” she explained. “I thought maybe because it’s colder up here, I’m just catching a cold. After a month it got to the point where I had extreme throat pain that I couldn’t sleep, to the point where I couldn’t speak.” However, it wasn’t until Rowe finally moved out that she realized what her roommate had done, when she saw this post from Brochu on her Instagram: “Finally did it yo girl got rid of her roommate!! After 1 1/12 month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons on her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn’t shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye Jamaican Barbie.” Prosecutors say they are still investigating the case.",1,0,0
452,452,"A Houston man is on the run after being accused Thursday of attacking a Lyft driver because of the drivers heritage, which is a hate crime. Matthew W. Dunn, 39, was charged Tuesday with assault that caused bodily injury, according to court records. Prosecutors announced the hate crime allegations on Thursday. If convicted, Dunn would face a harsher punishment because of the accusations that he selected his victim based on prejudice against the mans race, religion or national origin. We came through Harvey because of the cooperation of our diverse communities and their willingness to help each other without regard to race, creed or color, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said. A hate crime unleashes fear in an entire community. Dunn is accused of berating early on July 21 a Lyft driver because of his background and religion while Dunn was a passenger in the mans car. The driver picked up Dunn just after 2 a.m., said Nathan Beedle, the misdemeanor division chief at the Harris County District Attorneys Office. Midway through the ride, Dunn is accused of hurling obscenities at the driver, based on his perception that the driver was Muslim and from Pakistan. He is also accused of grabbing the drivers hair and punching him and choking him, as the driver drove Dunn near the 13500 block of the Northwest Freeway. During the melee, the drivers shirt was ripped and he was injured, Beedle said. Authorities believe Dunn eventually got out of the car. He chased the vehicle as the driver headed to safety. Dunn may have moved on to another victim, Beedle added. The driver called officers with the Houston Police Department who, about 15 minutes later, were flagged down by a security guard at a nearby motel, Beedle said. The guard told officers he had been approached by a man who authorities believe was Dunn. He said Dunn had put him in a headlock and was speaking incoherently, Beedle said. Dunn has not been charged in connection with the second suspected incident. It is still under investigation, Beedle added. Both happened within about 30 minutes, Beedle said. Dunn faces at least 180 days in jail if he is convicted. Dunn has two prior criminal convictions in Harris County. He pleaded guilty in February to the felony charge of possession of less than one gram of a controlled substance. In 2012, he was convicted of assault causing bodily injury.

455,455,"A prosecutor asked for patience Monday as authorities investigate the stabbing of a black Army officer, allegedly by a white University of Maryland student, in a possible hate crime on campus. COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — A prosecutor asked for patience Monday as authorities investigate the stabbing of a black Army officer, allegedly by a white University of Maryland student, in a possible hate crime on campus. The FBI is investigating the unprovoked stabbing of Richard Collins III as a possible hate crime. The suspect, Sean Urbanski, has belonged to a racist Facebook group. Police also said that he was intoxicated, and being tested for drugs. Defense attorney William C. Brennan argued Monday that the 22-year-old should be allowed to live at home under conditions including GPS monitoring and alcohol abuse treatment while his case goes forward. The judge declined, for now. Collins, 23, was stabbed early Saturday while visiting friends at the College Park campus. He had just been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army, and would have graduated Tuesday from Bowie State University, police said. Lt. Col. Joel Thomas, who runs the ROTC unit at Bowie State, described Collins as intelligent, athletic, personable and with all the makings of an outstanding military leader. At a news conference on Monday, Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Angela Alsobrooks cautioned against speculating about the case before facts are gathered. The killing was met with shock and fear on both campuses, which are nearby each other in suburban Washington. Bowie State, a historically black school, is having its commencement ceremony Tuesday in the same basketball stadium on the College Park campus where Maryland held its ceremony on Sunday. “If I’m a person of color I would certainly look at this as something that could happen to me. In fact, I know on Facebook our students are saying that,” said University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell. University of Maryland President Wallace Loh led students and families in a moment of silence for Collins at Sunday’s commencement. He called it a “senseless and unprovoked assault,” The Baltimore Sun reported. “We are still in shock that a young man, so full of promise, should have his life cut short, so suddenly,” Loh said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends, and with the entire Bowie State University community.” Mitchell said he asked for the FBI’s help after learning that Urbanski, 22, belonged to a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich: Nation,” where members post disparaging material about African-Americans and others. “We are here to evaluate that as an ongoing concern with respect to whether or not this was a hate crime,” Gordon Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Baltimore, said at a news conference Sunday evening. Brennan told the judge that Urbanski, who appeared in court via a television feed, had “no prior criminal record.” The judge said his request for bond could be revisited at a later date. Brennan and Urbanski’s parents left without commenting after Monday’s hearing. A message left Sunday at a number listed for his home in Severna Park was not immediately returned. Urbanski was added to the “Alt-Reich” Facebook group by an administrator in February. The group, which was taken down after the stabbing, had about 1,100 members and included racist, sexist and anti-Semitic photos and posts. Officials said Collins was with two friends waiting for an Uber ride at about 3 a.m. Saturday when they heard Urbanski screaming and watched him approach. Urbanski said “Step left, step left if you know what’s best for you,” according to the charging documents. Collins said ‘no,’ and Urbanski stabbed him once in the chest, the documents say. Officers found Urbanski sitting on a bench about 50 feet from where Collins collapsed, with a knife in his front right pocket, the documents say. Urbanski graduated from Severna Park High School in 2013, where he made the honor roll in 11th grade, according to media reports. Urbanski was not scheduled to graduate from the University of Maryland this year, police said. Zach Lessner, who was in a bowling league with Urbanski and just graduated from the University of Maryland, said he didn’t expect that Urbanski “would be the person to commit this horrendous act.” Dr. Artie Lee Travis, vice president for student affairs at Bowie State, said the school hopes the investigation moves forward as quickly as possible. “Hate has no place in America,” Travis said. “Hate has no place on a college campus, where young minds are coming together to try to change the world,” he said. Brian Douglas, who got to know Collins when they took a class together, said the man was looking forward to graduation. “He was just nice, just a good young man all around. You can’t find those too often in today’s society,” Douglas said. Ciera Sorrell, who also took a class with Collins, said his killing shocked the Bowie State community. “Everyone is in disbelief,” she said. “He seemed so excited to get to live his life and he doesn’t have that chance anymore.” ____ Richer reported from Richmond, Virginia.

462,462,"On June 12, 2016, Orlando experienced the unimaginable when a gunman opened fire at the Pulse nightclub, leaving 49 people dead, dozens injured, and countless traumatized. Two years later, speculation has returned on whether this senseless violence occurred at Pulse because it was a gay nightclub. Was it randomly selected? The shooter had gone to other places, including a different nightclub, and chose not to shoot. The description of Pulse on his search likely identified it as a gay bar. He even asked the security guard a question that would have left no doubt: “Where are all the women?” Was he a homophobe or a self-loathing gay man? Even though investigators debunked the idea that the killer was a regular at the nightclub with a secret Grindr account, the media ran with it. But his father did describe him as homophobic and said he became enraged after seeing two men kissing each other on a sidewalk. Two years later, this is what truly matters: The Pulse massacre fits the same pattern of mass shootings across the country. Angry men — and it is almost exclusively radicalized, bigoted white men — with easy access to weapons capable of mass murder keep killing people. LGBTQ people are disproportionately the victims of hate violence, including gun violence. Two years after Pulse what is clear is the lack of action by Florida Gov. Rick Scott and the state legislature. Parkland students have noted publicly the that our elected leaders were negligent when LGBTQ people were the victims. Today, the majority of Floridians, including nearly 80 percent of conservatives, say Rick Scott should keep his post-Pulse promise and sign an executive order banning discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. These protections exist at the local level, covering 60 percent of the state’s 20 million residents, but Florida has no statewide LGBTQ protections. This broken promise will dog Scott as he runs for office as the National Rifle Association’s favorite governor — in a state thats been the site of two of the worst mass shootings in the country: Parkland and Pulse. Two years later, the damage remains. The survivors are still struggling. And the hostility toward LGBTQ people that makes us disproportionately the victims of hate violence is being exacerbated from the highest office. The anti-Hispanic rhetoric from the White House also compounds the pain. The massacre at Pulse happened on Latin Night in the middle of Pride Month, and 90 percent of the 49 killed were Hispanic; nearly half were from Puerto Rico. We encourage people across the country to renew their commitment to the victims of Pulse with #HonorThemWithAction. To create real and lasting change, people must spend less time thinking about the shooter and more time holding our elected leaders accountable for taking action to prevent those who seek to do us harm from accessing weapons of mass slaughter. Join the HonorThemWithAction.org and commemorate the two-year mark of the Pulse tragedy by using the hashtag #HonorThemWithAction on social media to share how you are working in your community to make it a safer, more inclusive place for all.

464,464,"Photo Courtesy of Google One of the two bizarre attacks took place at 35th Avenue and Leavitt Street. By Forum Staff A 35-year-old Korean National has pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree robbery as a hate crime in connection with the vicious attacks on two Chinese women who were robbed and assaulted last year. The defendant at the time of his arrest told police, “I don’t like Chinese people.” “In pleading guilty, the defendant has now admitted to attacking the two Asian women because of his hatred for Chinese people”, said DA Brown. “The defendant, who is Korean, spotted each woman when she was alone in public and pounced upon them – punching them in the face and then stealing their cash and credit cards. This kind of bigotry and hate are not acceptable in a civilized society and will not be tolerated in Queens County. The defendant’s guilty plea is another example of our refusal to accept this type of behavior.” Key S. Lee, 35, of Hawthorne Avenue in the Flushing section of Queens plead guilty to two counts of second-degree robbery as a hate crime before Queens Supreme Court Justice Barry Kron. He will be sentenced on December 18, 2017, at which time Lee faces five years in prison to be followed by five years’ post release supervision. The charges in the case say that on January 27, 2016, one victim, Ling Chou, was cleaning snow from her vehicle following a snowstorm when she noticed the defendant standing on a nearby corner smoking a cigarette. She ignored the man and continued to chip away at the layers of snow on her car. But when she opened the back door, the defendant suddenly rushed her and pushed her into the back seat. He covered her body with his and then closed the door behind him. Lee repeatedly punched the woman in the face and grabbed her purse – stealing a credit card, her identification and approximately $2,000 in cash – as he fled the scene. According to that complaint, the defendant was shown surveillance video of the incident and admitted at that time that he was the attacker and that he did indeed rob Ms. Chou. He also stated that he was angry following an argument with his wife and that he used to work as a cab driver and the majority of his customers were Chinese. Lee stated in sum and substance, “I wanted to fight someone because the Chinese people were rude and smoking in the car…I wanted to pick a fight and that is when I saw one female cleaning snow and we made eye contact.” Lee also stated he became even more angry when he and Ms. Chou made eye contact and he said he “couldn’t take it any more. I decided she’s the one. I started beating her.” In the second attack on February 10, 2016, Lee spotted the victim, Ziao Feng, as she walked toward her apartment building and pounced on her. The defendant reigned punches on the woman’s face and then ran off with her handbag, which contained her credit cards, identification and about $2,000 in cash. At the time of his arrest, Lee stated that he had been driving home when the victim cut him off in traffic and failed to signal, so he followed her and when she parked her car he continued to follow her on foot and then attacked her. He stated at that time, “I don’t like the Chinese and I went to Flushing to look for Chinese people.”",1,0,0

James Alex Fields Jr., 21, was handed down the charges Wednesday. One charge relates to the death of Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old counter-protester killed when his Dodge Charger hit the crowd. In December, Fields was charged at the state level with first-degree murder for Heyer’s death. The indictment says Fields “stopped and then observed the crowd while idling in his vehicle” before speeding into the “racially and ethnically diverse crowd of individuals were gathered at the bottom of the hill,” Vice News reports. He then threw his car in reverse and fled the scene, leaving Heyer dead from blunt-force trauma to the chest and 35 others injured. “At the Department of Justice, we remain resolute that hateful ideologies will not have the last word and that their adherents will not get away with violent crimes against those they target,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement, per Vice News. “Last summer’s violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation.” H/T Vice News",1,0,0
474,474,"A Scottish YouTube creator named Markus Meechan, who goes by the moniker Count Dankula on his YouTube channel to his more than 100,000 subscribers, has been convicted of a hate crime for a video he posted featuring what the courts determined to be anti-Semitic content. Specifically, Meechan taught his girlfriend’s pug to use the Nazi Sieg Heil salute in a video he posted in 2016. The 30-year-old YouTube creator also taught the dog, ironically named Buddha, to respond to hate speech like “gas the Jews.” His video begins, “My girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is, so I thought I would turn him into the least cute thing I could think of, which is a Nazi.” Due for sentencing in April, Meechan has since apologized for the content. “I don’t actually hate Jewish people,” he said, according to The Jewish Chronicle, describing the video as “an insight into the darker side of my humor” and adding that he “did not intend for people, other than people who knew my comedy, to see the video.” The video was publicly available on YouTube, and its content was judged to be hate speech by Sheriff Derek O’Carroll of the Airdrie Sheriff’s Court in Scotland, where Meechan was convicted. According to multiple reports, O’Carroll said in court, “The accused knew that the material was offensive and knew why it was offensive. He would have known it was grossly offensive to many Jewish people.” While both the court and Ephraim Borowski, the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities’ director who lost family to the Holocaust and who spoke during the trial, did not consider the video a joke, other YouTube creators have come out in support of Meechan. JonTron, aka Jonathan Aryan Jafari, formerly of Game Grumps and currently running the JonTronShow channel, tweeted, “This is getting ridiculous…sets a dangerous precedent, sad day for the state of free speech.” This is getting ridiculous, man in UK found guilty for making a joke online, facing jail time.

DeFranco’s reasoning is that while being a Nazi is not okay, making jokes about being a Nazi is. Sheriff O’Carroll acknowledged this aspect of the case. “This court has taken the freedom of expression into consideration,” he said, “but the right to freedom of expression also comes with responsibility.” Before the court hands down sentencing next month, Meechan may be placed under house arrest with a GPS tracking device, depending on a social worker’s assessment.

483,483,"A Queens Village man will be getting a long prison sentence for firebombing five occupied buildings in Jamaica – including two houses of worship – over 5 years ago. Suraj Poonai Ray Lazier Lengend, 45, pleaded guilty to first-degree attempted arson as a hate crime. He is due to return to court for sentencing on Sept. 28, where Acting Queens Supreme Court Justice Barry Kron, who was presiding over the ruling, indicated that he would be sentencing Lengend to 20 years in prison with five years of post-release supervision. According to statements made by police, Lengend admitted that he planned the attacks to inflict as much damage as possible and that his goal was to take out as many Muslims and Arabs as possible. He later went on to state that he disliked Muslims, Arabs and Hindus. Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown said that the hateful rampage took place on New Year’s Day of 2012. First, Lengend threw a Molotov cocktail at a Hindu house of worship within a private residence on 170th Street in Jamaica, causing a fire on the front lawn. Lengend also admitted to throwing gasoline-filled bottles into a private residence on 43rd Avenue, which had people inside. Following that attack, Lengend drove to a deli located at 179th Street and Hillside Avenue, where he ignited a glass bottle containing gasoline and threw it inside the store. The Molotov cocktail broke when it hit the floor, spreading fire into the building. At that time, according to court records, Lengend drove to a house on 107th Avenue and through yet another flammable device through the front bedroom window. The fire caused damage to the interior and exterior of the home. Finally, Lengend threw a Molotov cocktail that the exterior of Al-Khoei Benevolent Association, a mosque located at 89-89 Van Wyck Expwy. The resulting fire caused damage to the mosque’s exterior. Cops arrested Lengend two nights later; he would later be indicted on federal and state hate crime charges. “In a single night, this individual filled glass bottles with gasoline to make crude molotov cocktails and then tossed them at five buildings,” Brown said. “His targets ranged from private dwellings to houses of worship – endangering those within the buildings as well as the firefighters called to respond to the scene.

He had recently been commissioned as a lieutenant in the Army and was to graduate from Bowie StateUniversity on Tuesday.(Facebook) WASHINGTON – The University of Maryland student suspected of killing a newly commissioned Army officer on the College Park campus over the weekend was ordered held without bond during a court appearance Monday afternoon, while the FBI investigates the stabbing as a possible hate crime. Sean Christopher Urbanski, 22, was charged with murder and assault in the killing of Richard W. Collins III, 23. Collins was set to graduate from nearby Bowie State University in Bowie, Md. on Tuesday with a degree in business administration. He had recently been commissioned as a lieutenant in the Army through the ROTC and was to serve in intelligence. The University of Maryland Police initially said that the attack was random and they the two men they did not know each other. But the campus police sought the FBI’s assistance after learning Urbanski, who is white, is a member of a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich Nation.” Collins was black. “Suffice to say, it’s despicable. It shows extreme bias against women, latinos, members of the Jewish faith, and especially African-Americans — which brings up questions of the motive in the case,” Mitchell said of the Facebook page at a news conference Sunday night. “We are here to evaluate that as an ongoing concern with respect to whether or not this was a hate crime,” Gordon Johnson, the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in nearby Baltimore, said at the news conference. Collins was waiting for an Uber with friends at about 3 a.m. Saturday when Urbanski approached them, police said. “Step left, step left if you know what’s best for you,” witnesses told police Urbanski said. After Collins reportedly replied “no,” Urbanski pulled out a knife and stabbed him once in the chest, police said. Police quickly apprehended Urbanski. Collins died at a hospital about an hour after he was stabbed. Both universities have reacted with shock – and fear. Police have stepped up patrols on and around the College Park campus. “If I’m a person of color, I would certainly look at this as something that could happen to me. In fact, I know on Facebook our students are saying that,” a visibly emotional Chief Mitchell said Sunday. A noose was found in a College Park fraternity house this month. A vigil for Collins is scheduled for Monday evening on the Bowie campus. The historically black institution’s graduation on Tuesday is being held on University of Maryland’s College Park campus. At Sunday’s commencement, College Park President Wallace Loh held a moment of silence for Collins. This article is republished with permission from Talk Media News. ",1,0,0

492,492,"On Monday May 21st, Joseph Caleca pleaded guilty to leaving the scene after causing injury in the 2014 hate crime involving Indian-American Sandeep Singh. Singh, who wears a turban, was critically injured after Caleca called him a “terrorist” and told him “go back to your country” before running him over in his pick up truck on a public street in Queens, New York, July 30, 2014. The truck dragged him for 30 feet and Singh was hospitalized with severe injuries. The Sikh Coalition represented Singh and worked with law enforcement officials, his family and the Sikh community to ensure that the assailant was identified and that the attack was investigated and prosecuted as a hate crime, the organization said in a May 30 press release. Caleca, who has been in prison for the past 17 months, was sentenced to one year already served and was released from prison based on custodial credits while awaiting trial. “Nobody should have to go through what I have endured, but my hope is that by exposing this bigoted violence we will continue to work together to eradicate hate,” Singh is quoted saying in the press release, adding, “While I’m disappointed that the formal hate crime charge was dropped during the plea agreement, I’m relieved that there is finally closure in my case and I am deeply thankful for the Sikh Coalition’s support and relentless advocacy.” “A hate crime enhancement is not to impose a harsher penalty, but to acknowledge that Sikhs remain targeted. The best way to combat the problem of hate in America is to have it recognized,” said Senior Staff Attorney, Julian Darwall. “While we recognize that the hate crime charge was not formally sentenced in this case, we applaud Sandeep’s courage in standing up to hate and telling his story as we continue our efforts to hold those accountable in similar cases across America,” Duvall added The Sikh Coalition provides pro-bono legal assistance to Sikhs who have been discriminated against or subjected to bias based upon their religious beliefs or identity.",1,0,0
